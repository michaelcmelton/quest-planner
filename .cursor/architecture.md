# Architecture Guidelines

## Project Structure
- Follow a modular architecture
- Separate concerns into distinct layers
- Keep business logic separate from presentation
- Use clear and consistent directory structure

## Component Design
- Design components to be reusable and composable
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Keep components small and focused
- Use props for configuration
- Implement proper state management

## State Management
- Use appropriate state management solution
- Keep state as close to where it's needed as possible
- Avoid global state when local state suffices
- Normalize complex state structures
- Implement proper state persistence when needed

## Data Flow
- Use unidirectional data flow
- Implement proper data validation
- Handle loading and error states
- Cache data appropriately
- Implement proper data synchronization

## API Design
- Design RESTful APIs
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Version APIs appropriately
- Document API endpoints
- Handle errors consistently

## Performance
- Optimize for initial load time
- Implement proper code splitting
- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Optimize assets and resources
- Monitor and measure performance
