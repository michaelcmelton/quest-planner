## 1. Product Overview
### 1.1 Purpose
The Quest Route Planner helps OSRS players plan efficient quest completion paths by:
- Validating quest requirements and dependencies
- Optimizing quest order based on rewards
- Supporting different account types and playstyles
- Minimizing redundant skill training

### 1.2 Target Users
- New OSRS players planning efficient account progression
- Speedrunners optimizing quest completion routes
- Specialized account builds (e.g., pures, skillers, ironmen)
- Returning players planning account goals

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- Route validation accuracy: 100% accuracy in requirement checking
  - Quest point requirement validation.
  - Quest pre-requisite validation.
- Number of routes created and shared

## 2. Feature Requirements
### 2.1 Core Features
1. Route Creation and Validation
   - Add/remove quests from route
   - Automatic validation of requirements
   - Real-time feedback on requirement violations
   - Support for parallel quest paths. Paths should be considered parallel if they can be completed concurrently, in any manner applicable keeping in mind skill requirements should be as similar as possible.

2. Requirement Tracking
   - Track quest prerequisites

3. Route Optimization
   - Suggest optimal quest order
   - Minimize skill training requirements
   - Account for quest rewards
   - Support different optimization goals:
      - fastest path to specific skill levels, taking training outside of questing into account.
      - accounting for certain skill restrictions or account restrictions with regard to quest XP.
      - We should have the user prioritize from a list of known optimizations we support which they would like to best optimize for.

4. Account Types Support
   - Regular accounts
   - Ironman accounts
   - Pure builds
   - Specialized restrictions, such as:
      - Skill restrictions
      - Quest restrictions
    

### 2.2 Secondary Features
- Route sharing
- Route comparison
- Progress tracking
- Skill Requirement Tracking
- XP waste calculation
- Quest reward optimization

### 2.3 Future Considerations
- Achievement diary integration
- Combat level optimization
- Wise Old Man API Integration for Player Lookup
- Move to persistant storage away from Local Storage API.
- Equipment optimization
- Multi-account support
- Additional validations for:
  - Skill requirements
  - Item requirements

- Route validation: < 100ms
- Route suggestions: < 500ms
- UI updates: < 16ms
- Support routes with up to Maximum amount of quests.
- When exceeded, caching results and progressive loading is acceptable.

### 3.2 Platform Support

   2. System suggests optimal path
   3. User modifies route
   4. User may or may not introduce custom nodes for notes, such as: "Train X Skill to level X."
   5. System validates changes
   6. User saves route after entering a name for the route.
   ```

2. Modify Existing Route
   ```
   1. Load saved route
   2. Add/remove/reorder quests
   3. Real-time validation
   4. Update route
   ```
