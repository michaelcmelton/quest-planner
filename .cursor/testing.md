# Testing Guidelines

## General Principles
- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain high test coverage
- Tests should be independent and isolated
- Tests should be deterministic
- Write tests before fixing bugs

## Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests focused and specific
- Use descriptive test names

## Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Test data flow between components
- Test API integrations
- Test state management
- Test error handling

## End-to-End Testing
- Test critical user journeys
- Test across different browsers
- Test responsive design
- Test accessibility
- Test performance

## Testing Tools
- Use appropriate testing frameworks
- Use mocking libraries for external dependencies
- Use snapshot testing for UI components
- Use code coverage tools
- Use performance testing tools

## Test Organization
- Group related tests together
- Use descriptive test suites
- Keep test files close to the code they test
- Maintain test data separately
- Document test setup and requirements
