By confronting him, you find out this was done to protect the rest of Gielinor from the threat in the elven lands.\n\nThe king sends you on a mission to travel through the Underground Pass and help his ally, Lord Iorwerth, in eradicating his brother King Tyras who threatens to revive the mysterious Dark Lord. After an arduous journey through the pass, you meet with Iorwerth and his forces to end Tyras' evil once and for all.\n\nUpon your return to Lathas you are intercepted by Arianwyn, a rebel elf who opposes Lord Iorwerth. He informs you of Lathas and Iorwerth's deception. They manipulated you into removing their final opposition and were now free to bring the Dark Lord back to Gielinor for their own intentions. You work with the elven rebellion to discover the purpose of the plague was to disguise the digsite of the long lost Temple of Light. An ancient place that is key to bringing back the Dark Lord.\n\nTo make amends for your past mistakes and put a halt in King Lathas' and Lord Iorwerth's plans, you solve the intricate light puzzle designed to protect the Death Altar within the temple.

It has shaped the course of Gielinor’s history, from the creation of the first Runes to the fall of Zaros. It was last seen at the devastating end of the God Wars, when Zamorak, in a fit of rage, used it to reduce the land of Forinthry to the Wilderness we know today.\n\nAngered by Zamorak’s actions, Guthix rose from his age-long slumber and banished the gods. He hid the Stone of Jas far underground, where it could never disturb the balance again...\n\nBut while Guthix sleeps, nefarious forces have been gathering; the Mahjarrat. Shaped by war and deadly ritual, their plans for the Stone can only lead to catastrophe.\n\nFacing off against the Mahjarrat is nothing new for dedicated adventurers – at every turn, they seem to grow in power and wage war against the people of Gielinor.
