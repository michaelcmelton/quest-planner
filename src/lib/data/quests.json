To complete it, you must trek around various [[Bar (location)|bars and pubs]] in ''Old School RuneScape'', drinking a specialty drink, having them sign off a supplied [[Barcrawl card]]. The miniquest is notable for granting the ability to automatically smash [[vial]]s on drinking the last dose of a potion.\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to the [[barbarian guard]] at the entrance of the Barbarian Agility Training Course.\n|startmap = 2544,3569\n|difficulty = 1\n|length = Medium\n|description = Go to bars and buy alcohol.\n|requirements = None\n|items = *208 [[coins]] to buy all the required alcohol\n|recommended = *[[Restore potion]]s to restore skills that are lowered\n*[[Food]] to recover any lost hitpoints\n*[[Stamina potion|Stamina]] or [[energy potion]]s\n*Fast travel to several locations\n**Barbarian Outpost ([[Games Necklace]])\n**Varrock ([[Varrock teleport]], [[Chronicle]] or [[Combat Bracelet]] to the Champions' Guild)\n**Lumberyard ([[Lumberyard teleport]], [[Digsite pendant]] or [[Digsite teleport]])\n**Tree Gnome Stronghold ([[Balloon Transport System]], [[Gnome Glider]], [[Spirit Tree]] or [[Slayer Ring]] to the Slayer Cave)\n**Brimhaven ([[Brimhaven teleport]], [[Teleport to House]] if your house is in Brimhaven, or ship from [[Ardougne]])\n**Musa Point ([[Amulet of Glory]] to Karamja or ship from [[Port Sarim]])\n**Port Sarim ([[Explorer's Ring 2]], [[Amulet of Glory]] to Draynor Village or [[Rat Pits]] [[minigame]] teleport)\n**Yanille ([[Watchtower teleport]] or [[Nightmare Zone]] [[minigame]] teleport)\n**Ardougne ([[Ardougne teleport]] or [[Ardougne cloak]])\n**Falador ([[Falador teleport]])\n**Seers' Village ([[Camelot teleport]] or [[Combat Bracelet]] to the Ranging Guild)\n|leagueRegion = <poem>\n{{RE|Kandarin}} - location requirement \nUnlocking {{RE|Kandarin}} will auto-complete the bar visits in {{RE|Asgarnia}}\nUnlocking {{RE|Fremennik}} {{okay}} will auto-complete the miniquest\n</poem>\n}}\n\n==Walkthrough==\n===Starting out===\nTo begin, talk to one of the barbarian guards outside the [[Agility]] training area at the [[Barbarian Outpost]] (Games necklace) to get the [[Barcrawl card]]. If your inventory is full, the guard will make no mention of the miniquest and you '''will not receive the card'''. While doing the bar crawl, you'll be given a card with a list of all the bars you have to visit. Each one will be checked off when you've found it and drunk the specific brew required. If you lose the card, you'll have to start the entire miniquest all over again.\n\nYou'll need to tell the barkeepers that you're doing the Alfred Grimhand Barcrawl and they will give you what you need. The brews are very strong, though, causing some damage as well as some steep temporary drops in stats. The entire trip will cost around 230 coins, plus money for [[runes]]/[[teleport tablet|tablets]] and boat trips to [[Karamja]]. Once you have every line of the card signed, return it to one of the guards at the Barbarian Outpost.\n\n===Visiting the bars===\nYou can visit the bars in any order. The amount of damage dealt by the damaging drinks is dependent on your [[Hitpoints]] level. For the possible routes, check out the section after the table below. Note that a very cost efficient way to get around is by going on to a house party world (World 330 for example) to use the teleports and the [[jewellery box]]es provided by the hosts.\n{|class=\"wikitable lighttable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Bar\n!Location\n!Drink Name\n!Cost (Coins)\n!Effects\n!Map\n|-\n|[[Blue Moon Inn]]\n|South-central [[Varrock]]\n|Uncle Humphrey's Gutrot\n|50\n|Lowers [[Attack]], [[Defence]], [[Strength]], [[Smithing]] and [[Hitpoints]].

Alternatively, the [[Amulet of glory]] or the [[Ring of dueling#Teleportation_options|Al Kharid PvP Arena teleport]] can be used to teleport to [[Al Kharid]] and then a [[gnome glider]] can be used to get to the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]] after completing [[The Grand Tree]] quest. It's also possible to use a [[Grand seed pod]] - note that this is not recommended due to the price of the pod. Alternatively, you can use a [[Skills Necklace|Fishing guild teleport]] and run West. After reaching the Tree Gnome Stronghold, go to the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the [[Grand Tree]], and get the drink from [[Blurberry]] at the [[Blurberry Bar]].\n*The [[Jolly Boar Inn]] - A [[Lumberyard teleport]] is the quickest way. If the [[gnome glider]]s can be used, you can take the glider to Varrock and walk north-west. Alternatively, you can use a [[Digsite Pendant]] or [[Digsite Teleport]] and walk north-west. You can also teleport to Varrock, head east outside of the city, and then straight north to the bar. If using the spirit trees, teleport back to the Grand Exchange and either use the north-west agility [[shortcut]] (21 Agility required) and run east along the [[Wilderness]] border. With {{SCP|Firemaking|50}} and access to the [[Balloon transport system]], you could alternatively teleport to [[Castle Wars]] and pay [[Willow logs]] to get to the Lumber Yard.\n*The [[Blue Moon Inn]] - Use a [[Varrock teleport]], the [[Chronicle]] or walk back to the southern end of Varrock.\n*The [[Flying Horse Inn]] -  The [[Rat Pits]] of [[Ardougne]] (run by [[Jimmy Dazzler]]) are next to the pub - if possible, you can teleport using the minigame teleport. Alternatively, use a [[Skills Necklace]] to teleport to the Fishing Guild, Teleport to [[Ardougne]], take [[Captain Barnaby]]'s boat from [[Rimmington]] or use the spirit tree in the Gnome Stronghold to teleport to the [[Khazard battlefield]], and then proceed to the north-western part of East Ardougne.\n* The [[Dragon Inn]] - Use a [[Watchtower Teleport]], [[Teleport to House|teleport to house]] in Yanille, teleport to Castle Wars, use fairy ring code {{fairycode|ciq}}, or the minigame teleport to the Nightmare Zone and walk south-west from there to [[Yanille]]. The bar is at the south-western part of the city.\n*The [[Rising Sun Inn]] - Teleport to Falador. The bar is south-west of the teleport spot.\n*[[The Rusty Anchor]] - Use an [[Explorer's ring 2]] or higher variant to teleport to the Falador farm cabbage patch and run south to The Rusty Anchor, use an [[amulet of glory]] to teleport to [[Draynor Village]] and walk west to Port Sarim, use the [[Rat Pits]] minigame teleport to get to [[Port Sarim]], use the [[Pest Control]] [[minigame teleport]] and run north and travel with the squire to get to Port Sarim, if your [[POH|house]] is in [[Rimmington]], teleport to house and run east to [[Port Sarim]], or simply walk south from Falador to Port Sarim and proceed to the most north-eastern building in Port Sarim.\n*The [[Karamja Wines, Spirits, and Beers|Karamja Spirits Bar]]  -  Take a ship to [[Musa Point]] from Port Sarim or glory teleport to Karamja.\n*[[Dead Man's Chest]] - Take a [[charter ship]] to [[Brimhaven]], or take [[Captain Barnaby]]'s boat from [[Rimmington]], or go to Musa Point and walk past the volcano.\n*Return to the [[Barbarian Outpost]], preferably by using a games necklace.\n}}\n\n====Alternative routes====\n=====Low magic/few teleports=====\n{{Checklist|\n*Run to the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]], go to the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the [[Grand Tree]], and get the drink from [[Blurberry Bar]].\n*Go to Ardougne, then proceed to the [[Flying Horse Inn]], located in the western side of East Ardougne.\n*Travel south to [[Yanille]].

In addition, players can speak to the [[barbarian guard]] to learn how to automatically smash empty vials upon drinking the last dose of a potion. After doing so, this feature can be toggled in the [[settings]] menu under \"Automatically smash empty vials.\"\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Alfred Grimhand's Barcrawl is required for the following:\n* [[Horror from the Deep]]\n* [[Medium Kandarin Diary]]\n* [[Scorpion Catcher]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*After completing all bar crawl locations, you will be unable to read the bar crawl card as you will be \"too drunk.\"\n*After drinking in Brimhaven, it says you think you see two bartenders signing two barcrawl cards.\n*After drinking at the Falador pub, your screen will sway slightly to indicate you are drunk.\n*None of the drinks appear in a player's inventory but are drunk automatically.\n*After you hand the bar crawl card to the guard, he says that he never learned to read, he just sees you are plenty drunk and lets you go to the agility course.\n*It is possible to redo the miniquest by drop-tricking to make a duplicate and, before completing the quest, dropping it again. To start it again, the player must go to one of the bars; however, they will be unable to enter the agility course until they complete it again.\n*Alfred Grimhand makes an appearance as a [[barbarian bartender]] in the [[2022 Christmas event]].

Ava will now request a [[bar magnet|magnet]].\n\n[[File:Animal Magnetism - Creating bar magnet.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|Creating the bar magnet.]]\nSpeak with the [[witch]] in a room nearby. She will give you a [[selected iron]] for 5 iron bars and instructions on how to turn the iron into a magnet. Travel to the centre of the mine north-east of [[Rimmington]] and use a hammer on the iron while facing north. This will turn it into a [[bar magnet]].\n\n===Undead twigs===\n{{Needed|[[Mithril axe]] and a [[holy symbol]].|recommended=Games necklace to teleport to Burthorpe.}}\nHead back to [[Ava]] with the magnet. You will be granted 50 [[Crafting]] experience when you give Ava the magnet. She will tell you she needs [[undead twigs]] from one of the [[undead tree]]s around the [[Draynor Manor|manor]]. Attempt to cut one of these trees, and you will find it cannot be done with a regular axe. Return to Ava to ask her for a solution, and she will refer you to [[Turael]] in [[Burthorpe]], who has apparently been using his [[Slayer]] skills to figure out a way to defeat the undead trees.\n\n[[File:Animal Magnetism - Cutting the Undead Tree.png|thumb|Cutting the undead tree.]]\nTalk to Turael. Make sure you don't accidentally request an unwanted [[Slayer task]] from him. Turael will grant you a [[blessed axe]] in exchange for a [[mithril axe]] and a [[holy symbol]]. He will not accept another type of axe. With the blessed axe, return to [[Draynor Manor]] and chop an undead tree until you receive some [[undead twigs]].\n\n===Translating the notes===\n{{Needed|[[Hard leather]] and [[polished buttons]].|recommended=}}\n[[File:Translated notes interface.png|thumb|right|The notes translated.]]\nDeliver the twigs to Ava. She will tell you she has almost completed her invention, but some of the [[Research notes (Animal Magnetism)|research notes]] she has gathered still need to be translated. You can translate these notes by selecting the correct buttons that appear on screen. ''You can use the picture for the solution.''\n\nOnce you have ungarbled the notes, talk to [[Ava]], and she will tell you the last items she needs to finish the device: some [[hard leather]] and [[polished buttons]]. Combine these two items with the [[A pattern|pattern]] given to you to create [[a container]]. Hand the container over to Ava to complete the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations!

They can be found in the northern part of the city, up the stairs, then east to house with quest start icon. They will explain they are making a train route between [[Keldagrim]] and [[Dorgesh-Kaan]]. Go to the Station south-west of the city (without going down the first staircase, see middle image above) until you find a transportation sign (on your minimap). Go through the doorway, and you will end up in a train station.\n[[File:Another Slice Of H.A.M - speaking to Tegdak.png|thumb|220px|Talking to Tegdak.]]\nWalk south on the tracks and talk to [[Tegdak]]; he will give you a [[trowel]] and a [[specimen brush]]. Dig up the [[artefact]]s hidden on the unfinished railway tracks by using the trowel on them (they look similar to the other rocks on that surface but they are bigger than others so it's quite easy to recognise). Clean all six artefacts by using an artefact on the specimen table - you will then end up with an [[armour shard]], an [[axe head]], a [[helmet fragment]], an [[ancient mace]] (shows as a \"mace\" for now), a [[shield fragment]], and a [[sword fragment]]. After cleaning them, talk to Tegdak.\n[[File:Another Slice Of H.A.M - excavating goblin artefacts.png|thumb|220px|Digging up one of the artefacts.]]\n\n===To the village===\n'''Items needed:''' Ranged or magic weapons and armour, a light source\n\nBefore continuing, it's recommended that you bank and equip gear to fight with ranged or magic now (knives and darts will not work unless you can use long range). You won't get a chance to bank before the upcoming fight.\n[[File:Another Slice Of H.A.M - Goblin Village gathering.png|thumb|left|220px|The meeting.]]\n\n'''NOTE:''' In this section, Zanik will follow you just as she did in the past. '''''You must dismiss your follower before taking her with you.''''' Additionally, if you teleport yourself you will leave Zanik behind. If you lose her, return to the station tunnel to ask her to follow you again.\n\nNow, take [[Zanik]] with you, and go north. Exit the station and visit the [[goblin scribe]] west of Ur-tag's house, where you started the quest.\n\nTalk to him about the symbols that are covering the mace that you found. The scribe will not be able to tell you anything about the symbols, but he suggests that you go talk to the goblin generals in [[Goblin Village]].\n\nGo down the stairs in the house just west of the scribe and talk to [[Oldak]]. He will teleport you to the [[Goblin Village]] and give you a sphere to teleport back to the city.\nOnce you're in the village, talk to one of the generals and a cutscene will begin. In the end, you discover that Zanik is likely the goblins' prophesied 'Chosen Commander'. The mace is also found to have the power of the goblin 'Big High War God', [[Bandos]].\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===The H.A.M-bush===\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Another Slice Of H.A.M - H.A.M attack.png|thumb|220px|Attacking the H.A.M units.]]\nAt the end of the cutscene, two [[H.A.M. Member]]s show up and start attacking the goblins with [[Ranged]] and [[Magic]]. Head south, taking the path around the back (west side) of the buildings, but stay out of the attack range. When you get to the tower, climb up the ladder and kill the [[H.A.M. Mage]] and [[H.A.M. Archer]] with either Magic or Ranged. A [[bronze crossbow]] and 50 [[bronze bolts]] spawn upstairs next to the ladder if you need a weapon. They do not respawn if you run out of ammo. However, you can respawn the bolts by closing and reopening the quest's instance. This can be done in a relatively quick fashion by walking a few tiles south of the ladder and then back north. This will reset both of the enemies as well, so if you think you'll need more than 50 bolts, collect extra bolts before you start trying to kill them. You will likely take hits climbing up and down the ladder even if you're only grabbing the bolts.\n[[File:Another Slice Of H.A.M - Sigmund appears.png|thumb|left|220px|Sigmund threatening to kill Zanik.]]\nYou can simply fight the two foes, or you can also take cover behind the box so you won't take damage. When you're prepared, come out from behind the crates and attack the H.A.M. If things get too hot, or you need a break, click \"''hide behind crate''\" again in order to stop the damage. The mage and ranger will hit at the same time, and never miss, so using [[Prayer|protection prayers]] can only reduce damage. It is possible to avoid all damage by hiding behind crates, click one enemy, and then immediately after hide behind crates. Using a [[crossbow (weapon)|crossbow]] on rapid-fire allows the player to fire a [[bolt]] and hide behind the crates before the enemy's projectile hits. In order to use darts, the player must use the Long Range combat style.\n\nWhen you have done this, there will be another short cutscene where [[Zanik]] is kidnapped by [[Sigmund]]. The goblin generals will tell you they are sending two sergeants to help you and that you should meet them at [[Lumbridge Swamp Caves|Lumbridge Swamp]]. They will also give you the [[ancient mace]].\n\n===Getting past the guards===\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Guards (Another Slice of H.A.M.) map location.png|frame|This map shows how to navigate the guards.]]\n[[Sigmund]] plans to kill her on the train tracks between [[Keldagrim]] and [[Dorgesh-Kaan]], making it look like an accident so that war will break out between the dwarves and the goblins. You cannot enter through the Dorgesh-Kaan entrance this time (it will say the staircase is closed), so you must go to the Lumbridge swamp cave entrance and meet the goblin warriors who will be helping you.\n\nNow, go to the [[Lumbridge Swamp]], and talk to the goblin sergeants, [[Sergeant Slimetoes]] and [[Sergeant Mossfists]]. They should be near the entrance to the Lumbridge Swamp Caves (make sure you have your [[light source]] for this part).\n[[File:Another Slice Of H.A.M - getting past guards.png|thumb|220px|Hiding behind the boxes.]]\n\n{{Checklist|\n*Climb down the entrance to the caves and next to the rope should be another ladder.\n*Go down the ladder, and you will briefly see a [[Guard (Another Slice of H.A.M.)|H.A.M. Guard]] before he runs away to get reinforcements.\n*Now, talk to the goblins. Tell one to wait behind and then run down the hallway into the nearby room, hiding while the two guards run past.\n*Make sure the second goblin is not standing by the wall, then tell him to wait in the room.\n*When the two guards walk past the room and engage in combat with the goblin that you left behind, go down by the boxes, and hide behind one of them until a third guard walks past.\n*After the third guard attacks the first goblin, run back into the room and tell the second goblin to follow you.\n*With the goblin following you, run to the last guard standing by the ladder. Make sure that goblin is near you and stand behind him so that the guard attacks him.\n*After the guard engages in combat with the goblin, head down the ladder.\n}}\n===Another Sigmund showdown===\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Another Slice Of H.A.M - Zanik tied up.png|thumb|200px|Zanik, tied up.]]\n'''Note:''' If you use the mace's special attack too quickly after the fight starts there is a possibility that it will not work and the prayer-draining effect will not appear.\n[[File:Another Slice Of H.A.M - Sigmund smited.png|thumb|200px|Sigmund is smited!]]\n{{Listen\n|title = Grand Opening\n|desc = The music which plays during the grand opening of the train line.\n|filename = Another Slice of H.A.M. - Grand Opening.ogg\n}}\nA cutscene will play, and you will immediately have to fight [[Sigmund]] (level 64). Attack him using any weapon, and he will turn on the [[Protection prayers|Protection prayer]] corresponding to that attack, thus making him invulnerable. Use the [[ancient mace]]'s [[special attack]] to remove his ability to use protection prayers for the rest of the fight, and finish him off using whichever method you prefer. \n\nNote that this fight is not optional; if you attempt to untie [[Zanik]] whilst the fight is still in progress, you will be hit for around 10 [[Hitpoints]] of damage.\n\n===The end===\n[[File:Another Slice Of H.A.M - train system opening.png|thumb|left|200px|The grand opening of the train line.]]\nOnce Sigmund has been defeated, he will teleport away. Untie [[Zanik]] and get ready to watch the final cutscene about the grand opening of the [[Dorgesh-Kaan–Keldagrim train system]].\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Another Slice of H.A.M.\n|image = [[File:Another Slice of H.A.M. reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Mining|3,000|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Prayer|3,000|link=yes}} experience\n*The [[ancient mace]]\n*The ability to buy [[Goblin Village]] [[Goblin village sphere|teleport sphere]]s\n*Free access to the [[Dorgesh-Kaan–Keldagrim train system]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Another Slice of H.A.M. is required for the following:\n*[[Lumbridge & Draynor Diary]] hard task: Take the train from Dorgesh-Kaan to Keldagrim.\n*[[Land of the Goblins]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 17 January 2019\n|update = Kebos Graphical Changes and Other Fixes\n|type = mobile\n|change = A flash effect in a cutscene has been fixed on mobile.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Sigmund]] ties [[Zanik]] to a railway track.

The Hosidius architect explains that he wishes to rebuild the statue of King Rada I in the [[Kourend Castle]] courtyard after it was heavily damaged in a storm. However, he is unable to receive the assistance of the other architects in their respective cities, and requests that you do so for him.\n\nIn order to receive the assistance of a Great Kourend architect, players need to speak with them once they gain 100% [[favour]] with their respective city. Once players have spoken to an architect, they will then appear at the statue. In order to complete the miniquest and rebuild the statue of King Rada, players must gain 100% favour with all cities.\n\nThe location of the architects are as follows:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=5|Locations\n|-\n|{{Map|name=Arcis|1652,3754|mtype=pin|icon=redPin|caption=[[Arcis]] in [[Arceuus]].|width=200|height=200}}\n|{{Map|name=Piliar|1794,3738|mtype=pin|icon=redPin|caption=[[Piliar]] in [[Port Piscarilius]].|width=200|height=200}}\n|{{Map|name=Lovada|1487,3833|mtype=pin|icon=redPin|caption=[[Lovada]] in [[Lovakengj]].|width=200|height=200}}\n|{{Map|name=Shayda|1532,3545|mtype=pin|icon=redPin|caption=[[Shayda]] in [[Shayzien]].|width=200|height=200}}\n|{{Map|name=Hosa|1631,3671|mtype=pin|icon=redPin|caption=[[Hosa]] in [[Hosidius]].|width=200|height=200}}\n|}\n\n==Gaining Favour==\n{{main|Kourend Favour}}\n[[File:Kourend Favour interface.png|frame|The Kourend Favour interface found within the [[Quest List]] [[interface]].]]\n[[Favour]] can be earned with houses by doing certain activities for them.

Upon speaking with her, a shocked Mori tells you that her friend, [[Thana]], has died. This is considered impossible, as [[Citizens of Arceuus]] had achieved immortality a thousand years ago during an event known as the Ascent of Arceuus. She asks you to seek help from [[Councillor Andrews|David Andrews]], the leader of the [[Kourend Council]], the current ruling authority of [[Great Kourend]].\n\n{{Map|name=Councillor Andrews|x=1621|y=3674|plane=1|r=3|mtype=square|align=right|width=250|height=250|caption=Location of Councillor Andrews}}\nTravel just south-west to [[Kourend Castle]] and speak to [[Councillor Andrews]] on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}}. He will tell you that the Arceuus family have chosen to keep their knowledge secretive, and thus the Council cannot lend their assistance.\n\n'''Hint''': Pray at an altar in the top floor of the castle to complete a task in the easy [[Kourend & Kebos Diary]].\n\nReturn back to Mori and tell her that the Council will do nothing to help. Mori informs the player that the Council doesn't often provide help and actually were never meant to rule the Kingdom. She suggests that if the Council won't help, maybe [[Lord Trobin Arceuus|Lord Arceuus]] will, as she guesses that he will not be able to ignore a death among his own people.\n\n===Tower of Magic===\n{{Needed|recommended=A weapon to kill 5 [[Tormented Soul]]s (Level 16).}}\nWalk north-west to the [[Tower of Magic]], just west of the [[Arceuus Library]]. Speak to the [[Tower Mage]] outside the doors and inform them that there has been a death in Arceuus. They say that the tower has been experiencing issues, but as your investigation may be linked to their problems, they allow you to enter.\n[[File:The Ascent of Arceuus - tormented souls.png|thumb|left|250px|Tormented souls tormenting the tower mages.]]\nUpon entering the tower, the player will be faced with several [[Tormented Soul]]s, which seem to be attacking the mages inside. There are five spirits: one which immediately attacks the player, and four attacking the mages. Kill all of them.\n\n[[File:The Ascent of Arceuus - Lord Trobin's spell.gif|thumb|200px|Lord Trobin Arceuus in a magical trance.]]\nHead upstairs and speak with [[Asteros Arceuus]], the son of Lord Trobin Arceuus. He will tell the player that a short while ago, their instruments detected fluctuations in power from the [[Dark Altar]], causing them to feel a strange loss of power, as if the Altar itself had failed altogether.\n\nAfter realising this, [[Lord Trobin Arceuus]] used himself as a conduit to channel what little power the Dark Altar had left. This failure of the Dark Altar is what caused the experimental trapped souls to break free and turn feral, and caused Thana's death. Lord Arceuus' power is the only thing keeping his people alive.\n\nAsteros reveals to the player that his father isn't the one who discovered the knowledge of immortality, despite the belief by most that he did. Rather, the knowledge was given to him by three volcanic creatures known as the [[Tasakaal]]. These ancient beings reside in the sulphur volcano of [[Mount Karuulm]] and possess far more knowledge of the Dark Altar than anyone else in Arceuus. Asteros will ask that you contact them to find a way to restore power to the Dark Altar.\n\n===The Tasakaal===\n[[File:The Ascent of Arceuus - The Tasakaal.png|thumb|right|The [[Tasakaal]], seated in the [[Karuulm Slayer Dungeon]].]]\n[[File:Kaal-Mej-San chathead.png|left]]\nMake your way over to [[Mount Karuulm]], which can be quickly accessed with the fairy ring code {{Fairycode|CIR}} or by using a [[Battlefront teleport]] or the [[Skills necklace]] to the [[Farming Guild]]. Having 62 [[Agility]] will make navigating the mountain slightly easier and quicker.\n\n'''Hint''': West of the entrance to the dungeon, down the mountain, is a mine containing some iron rocks that can be mined to complete a task in the easy [[Kourend & Kebos Diary]].\n\nEnter the [[Karuulm Slayer Dungeon]] on the mountain's summit via the [[elevator]]; you do not need to bring foot protection. Speak to one of the three [[Tasakaal]]; they will initially dismiss you, but will listen to you after hearing the name \"Arceuus\". They will tell you that Trobin came to them long ago, pleading to help his dying wife. They granted him the knowledge of immortality, but he misused it to grant the entire people of Arceuus immortality, upsetting the balance of the world: \"For every death, there must be life. For every life, there must be death. Perfectly balanced. As all things should be.\" Thus, they will refuse to help the Arceuus, as their time has long been overdue.\n\nAfter offering to help the Tasakaal in exchange for saving the people of Arceuus, they will admit the Arceuus' work with souls has been useful in helping to maintain the balance. The Tasakaal will agree to help you, provided that you help them with a task of their own. They will tell you to free a trapped soul in a grave south-east of the mountain before they will assist you.\n\n[[File:The Ascent of Arceuus - The ancient grave.png|thumb|The ancient grave the Tasakaal mentioned to you.]]\nIf you have a second [[Battlefront teleport]], use it to directly arrive at the [[Ancient Grave]]. If not, leave the mountain and head south-east of the mountain to get to it. Inspect the ancient grave and follow the tracks by inspecting the plants to the end east of the [[Farming Guild]] (note: inspect the plants that the tracks follow), where a [[Trapped Soul]] will attack. Make sure to inspect each plant on the pathway there to reveal the footprints or the trapped soul will not appear. Importantly, the soul pops out of a bush, by running to the other side the Trapped Soul is safespottable. The Trapped Soul will crawl back into the bush if you run out of sight of it. The Trapped Soul will disappear if you take too long to kill it, making this fight tricky for very low levels.\n\nOnce the soul has been disposed of, return to the Tasakaal. They tell you that they have found the cause of the problem; the Dark Altar is working as normal, but someone has placed a device to redirect its power to a construct nearby.\n\n===Finishing up===\n[[File:Lord Trobin Arceuus chathead.png|left]]\nHead to the [[Dark Altar]], north-east of the Arceuus Library. You can use the [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|CIS}}, a [[games necklace]] to [[Wintertodt]], or an [[Arceuus library teleport (tablet)|Arceuus library teleport tablet]]. Inspect the rocks around it until you find a strange device, which you automatically smash. Return to the [[Tower of Magic]], and speak to [[Lord Trobin Arceuus|Lord Arceuus]] to complete the quest. He will be concerned that someone has deliberately tried to sabotage the Dark Altar and that he has sent researchers to find out how the device works, thanking you for saving his people.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=The Ascent of Arceuus\n|image=[[File:The Ascent of Arceuus reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp=1\n|rewards=*2,000 [[coins]]\n*{{SCP|Hunter|1,500|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Runecraft|500|link=yes}} experience\n*A page for [[Kharedst's memoirs]], '[[A dark disposition]].'

If [[Twilight's Promise]] is completed you can use [[Renu]] right next to where you land to quickly go to the [[Hunter Guild]], otherwise run just south-west of the city. Speak to [[Guildmaster Apatura]] in the [[Hunter Guild]], in the building with the oven. Ask her if she needs any help, and she will tell direct you to [[Guild Scribe Verity]]. Verity is found in the [[The Burrow|Burrow]], the guild's underground pub, which can be accessed via the stairs inside the large tree.\n\nSpeak to Verity behind the counter. She will introduce you to the guild's [[rumours]] system, then tell you that she and [[Huntmaster Gilman (Novice)|Gilman]] are concerned about [[Guild Hunter Fox|Fox]], who left without informing anyone of his whereabouts. She will add that [[Guild Hunter Wolf (Master)|Wolf]] had put him up to the hunt, and asks that you speak to her for information.\n\nWolf will tell you that she asked Fox to make some repairs to the bed of [[Guild Hunter Kiko|Kiko]], the grey cat nearby, which has recently become tatty, and assumes he's out to get the required materials. To distract Kiko so you can inspect his bed, Wolf will give you a [[toy mouse]]; wind it up and then use it on Kiko. Once Kiko is distracted, attempt to check the cat bed. You will find that the bed is made of a fluffy fur and that someone has cut off a small bit of it.\n\nBe warned, if you use your cat to catch the toy mouse it will disappear and you will have to find another one yourself.\n\nTalk to Wolf again, who will tell you that Fox has likely gone to [[Outer Fortis]] to meet a contact who stocks good quality fabrics, and guesses that he is hunting [[pyre fox]]es along the way there.\n\n===Fox Tracking===\n{{Needed|[[Box trap]], [[hammer]]}}\n{{Map|zoom=1|mtype=pin|align=right|caption=Key locations:<br>\n'''Red:''' Guild Hunter Fox and smooth leaves.<br>\n'''Yellow:''' Sticky leaves and embertailed jerboas.<br>\n'''Green:''' Atza\n|1618,2979,icon:redPin,desc:Guild Hunter Fox/smooth leaves\n|1673,2992,icon:yellowPin,desc:Sticky leaves and jerboas\n|1697,3064,icon:greenPin,desc:Atza}}\nMake your way to the [[Avium Savannah]] mining site, just south-east of the guild. [[Guild Hunter Fox|Fox]] will be found, laying injured, on the south-east side of the crevice there. Dazed, he tells you that he was attacked and cannot move, and that to help him recover, he'll need two plants to make a poultice, as well as a [[jerboa tail]] to hold them together.\n\nThe first plant can be found immediately west, as a brownish [[leafy bush]]; pick a [[smooth leaf]] from it. The second plant is found by the western end of the [[Locus Oasis]], also as a brownish [[rough-looking bush]]; pick a [[sticky leaf]] from it. Lastly, catch an [[embertailed jerboa]] north of the Locus Oasis with a [[box trap]] for the tail; acquire two, as you'll need one for later.\n\nCombine the three items to create the [[makeshift poultice]], and return to Fox. He will feel better and tell you that he was attacked and knocked unconscious whilst on a hunt, and so cannot identify his attacker. However, he will ask that you deliver a [[fur sample]] to someone named [[Atza]] to acquire the fur needed for Kiko's bed.\n\nAtza is found in one of the buildings just south-east of the South gate of [[Civitas illa Fortis]] (note: not the south-east gate), which contains a [[pile of equipment]] in the middle. She will have the fur, but needs to find it. There is a hammer spawn in the house directly north of here. Set up the aforementioned pile of equipment for her and finish the conversation to obtain the [[trimmed fur]].\n\nBring the fur to Fox, who will ask that you let Wolf and Verity know that he's doing fine. He will ask that you repair Kiko's bed, as well as deliver [[Fox's report|his report]] to Verity.\n\n===Finishing up===\n{{Needed|[[Jerboa tail]] and either a [[needle]] or [[costume needle]]}}\nReturn to the [[Hunter Guild]] and deliver Fox's report to Verity in the Burrow pub, then repair Kiko's bed.\n\nLastly, speak to [[Guildmaster Apatura]] to finish the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = At First Light\n|image = \n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n* {{SCP|Hunter|4,500|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n* {{SCP|Construction|800|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n* {{SCP|Herblore|500|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n* Access to Master Tier [[Hunters' Rumours]]\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n{{At First Light}}"

Alternatively, players can also use the [[Barbarian Assault]] [[minigame teleport]] (after fully playing through the tutorial), or run up directly from [[East Ardougne]] and climb the cliff side of the waterfall to the plateau.\n\nOtto is interested in the cultural history of his people and will offer to teach eligible players about barbarian skills. Upon speaking to him, respond with, \"You think so?\" to start the miniquest.\n\nLater on, if you ask about the [[Ancient Cavern]] under the lake, he will give a blank [[My notes|note book]]. You can add to the note book as you find [[ancient page]]s within, which are usually collected by searching [[Skeleton (Ancient Cavern)|skeletons]] on the cave floor. Note that doing so may result in a [[skeleton heavy]] or [[skeleton hero]] attacking.\n\n==Fishing==\n[[File:Fishing icon (detail).png|left|frameless]]\n[[Otto]] will give the player information about barbarian [[Fishing]], allowing the player to fish with a heavy rod and catch new fish, as well as catch fish barehanded. Note that you do not need to complete both sections to begin fishing in the nearby waters with a [[barbarian rod]]. \n\n===Heavy rod fishing===\n''Requirements: {{SCP|Fishing|48|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Agility|15|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Strength|15|link=yes}}''\n{{Needed|[[Fishing bait]], [[feathers]], [[fish offcuts]], [[roe]] or [[caviar]]|recommended=[[Knife]]}}\n[[File:Average heavy rod fishing XP rates.png|thumb|Barbarian Fishing experience rates using a heavy rod as a function of Fishing level.]]\nSpeak to Otto and ask \"What can I learn about the use of a fishing rod?\" He will tell you that barbarians use heavier tackle to catch [[leaping fish]] in the lake nearby. He will tell you to search under his [[barbarian bed|bed]] to obtain a [[barbarian rod]].\n\nUse the [[Fishing spot (barbarian)|fishing spots]] around the lake to catch a leaping fish. The fish provide a low-effort training method, as well as small amounts [[Cooking]] experience from successfully gutting the fish with a knife and obtaining [[roe]] or [[caviar]]. Though gutting is not necessary for general training, it gives a good chance of obtaining [[fish offcuts]], which can be used as bait for these fishing spots. Roe and caviar can also be used as bait if there are no other types of bait in the player's inventory.\n\nOne roe is needed for the Barbarian Herblore section further below, and multiple fish may need to be gutted due to the possibility of failing to do so.

Don't bring in anything you are not willing to lose.''\n[[File:Pyre Ship chewed bones.gif|frame|A barbarian Spirit being laid to rest]]\nAfter creating a fire with a bow, players can ask Otto \"I have completed firemaking with a bow. What follows this?\", and he will explain how to make [[pyre ship]]s, which involves diving into the [[Ancient Cavern]] below the lake to obtain [[chewed bones]]. Only [[mithril dragon]]s will drop chewed bones (at a rate of ~1/42), and obtaining one is required to complete the miniquest; [[mangled bones]] will '''not''' count.\n\nAfter receiving the bones, players can build the pyre ship, requiring a set of logs(preferably magic logs for the Elite Kandarin diary requirement) , a [[woodcutting axe]], and a [[tinderbox]] or suitable bow. Pyre ships can be created on the [[pyre site]]s around the lake near [[Otto's Grotto]]. Burning a pyre ship will grant the player an experience bonus of up to 300%, depending on the logs used, the next time they bury [[bones]]. In order to receive this bonus, the player must have fully completed the Firemaking portion of barbarian training.\n\n[[Peaceful barbarian spirit]]s released from chewed bones will give you [[Chewed bones#Rewards|some items]], including a 1/256 chance for a [[dragon full helm]], while spirits released from mangled bones result in a level 166 [[ferocious barbarian spirit]] appearing, who will attack the player. Please note that if you use mangled bones to make a pyre ship, you will be unable to make another pyre ship until you kill the spirit. If you attempt to make another one while a barbarian spirit is around, the sacrifice will be declined.\n\nPyre ships have [[boost]]able [[Firemaking]] and [[Crafting]] level requirements.\n\n{{Table/Pyre ships}}\n\n==Farming==\n[[File:Farming icon (detail).png|left|frameless]]\n[[Otto]] will give the player information about barbarian [[Farming]]. Completion of barbarian Farming allows players to plant [[seed]]s without a [[seed dibber]], and automatically destroy [[empty plant pot]]s when planting [[tree patch|trees]].\n\n=== Bare-handed planting===\n{{Needed|Any [[seed]] that can be planted with a [[seed dibber]], 1 free [[Farming/Patch locations|Farming patch]].|recommended=A [[rake]] to clear any [[weeds]] on the patch.}}\n\nAfter asking about agricultural training, Otto will request that you plant a seed without a seed dibber. This can be done using any type of patch that requires a seed dibber to plant seeds, for example [[Herb patch|herbs]] and [[Allotment patch|allotments]], however planting [[grape seeds]] will not progress the miniquest. After the seed is planted, you can return to Otto immediately; you don't need to wait for it to grow. Note that this can fail, so it is advised to use low cost/plentiful seeds. You'll know you succeed when you receive the message {{Mes|You feel you have learned more of barbarian ways. Otto might wish to talk to\nyou more.}} Once completed, you will no longer fail to plant seeds bare-handed.\n\n===Pot-smashing===\n''Requirements: {{SCP|Farming|15|link=yes}}''{{Needed|A [[spade]], any [[sapling]], 1 free [[tree patch]], [[fruit tree patch]] or [[special tree patch]].|recommended=An [[axe]] or 200 [[coins]] to clear the required patch if it is occupied}}\n\nTalk to [[Otto Godblessed|Otto]] again after planting a seed bare-handed, and ask again about agricultural training. He will speak about channeling your anger and strength into smashing the pot into dust, as not to leave a mess of pot shards all over the place. Otto will then give you the ability to smash and destroy pots automatically after planting the contents within.\n\nAfter planting a [[filled plant pot]] with any [[sapling]] to an empty [[tree patch]], your character will smash the pot to dust, and you can return to Otto to complete your Barbarian Farming training. This feature can be toggled in the [[settings]] menu under \"Automatically smash empty plant pots.\"\n\nNote: Spirit trees will not work with completing this training.\n\n==Smithing==\n[[File:Smithing icon (detail).png|left|frameless]]\nAfter completion of the Fishing section, speak to [[Otto]] and ask him to tell you more about the use of spears. He will teach you how to make [[spear]]s and [[hastae]], but only after you've completed [[Tai Bwo Wannai Trio]]. Completion of this section is required to equip the [[Zamorakian hasta]] and [[dragon hunter lance]].\n\n===Making the weapons===\n''Requirements: {{SCP|Smithing|5|link=yes}}, completion of [[Tai Bwo Wannai Trio]]\n\n''{{Needed|two [[bars]], two corresponding [[logs]], and a [[hammer]]}}\n\nTake a metal [[bar]] and some corresponding [[logs]], and use them on the [[barbarian anvil]] outside [[Otto's Grotto]]. Once you've made the spear, talk to [[Otto]] again, and he will tell you about [[hastae]]. '''Be careful to make only one spear, as the second bar is required for the next step.'''\n\nForging [[hastae]] is exactly the same; take a metal [[bar]] and the corresponding [[logs]], and then use them on the barbarian anvil. Next, talk to [[Otto]] again, and your Barbarian Smithing training will be completed. If Otto says, \"You do not exude the presence of one who has poured his soul into manufacturing spears,\" it means that you need to first smith a spear on the anvil near his grotto. \n\nA table of the spears and hastae that you can make, as well as the logs and bars needed, is found below:\n{| class=\"wikitable align-center-1 align-center-3 align-center-5 align-right-7 align-right-8\"\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[Spear]]s\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[Hasta]]e\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Logs required\n! colspan=\"2\" |{{SCP|Smithing|link=y}}\n|-\n!Level\n!Exp\n|-\n| {{plinkt|Bronze spear}}\n| {{plinkt|Bronze hasta}}\n| {{plinkt|Logs}}\n|5||25\n|-\n| {{plinkt|Iron spear}}\n| {{plinkt|Iron hasta}}\n| {{plinkt|Oak logs}}\n|20|| 50\n|-\n| {{plinkt|Steel spear}}\n| {{plinkt|Steel hasta}}\n| {{plinkt|Willow logs}}\n|35||75\n|-\n| {{plinkt|Mithril spear}}\n| {{plinkt|Mithril hasta}}\n| {{plinkt|Maple logs}}\n|55||100\n|-\n| {{plinkt|Adamant spear}}\n| {{plinkt|Adamant hasta}}\n| {{plinkt|Yew logs}}\n|75||125\n|-\n| {{plinkt|Rune spear}}\n| {{plinkt|Rune hasta}}\n| {{plinkt|Magic logs}}\n|90||150\n|-\n| {{plinkt|Zamorakian spear}}<ref group=\"n\" name=\"zamorak\">You need to pay Otto {{NoCoins|300,000|c}} in order to convert a Zamorakian spear into a Zamorakian hasta.

Add the [[roe]] you obtained during [[#Barbarian Fishing|the Fishing section]] to the two-dose attack potion, and hand it back to Otto. This will fully complete the training.\n\n===Barbarian potions===\nAfter finishing this training stage, many other potions can be enhanced by adding [[roe]] or [[caviar]] to a two-dose variant of the potions. To make 2 two-dose potions from a four-dose potion, players can use the four-dose potion on an empty [[vial]], or have certain [[Decanting#Decanting to 2-dose and 3-dose|NPCs]] do it for them.\n\nThrough the creation of barbarian mixes, they will additionally heal 3 or 6 Hitpoints (depending on the mix type) in addition to the regular effects to normal potions, with the trade-off being that each potion mix is only two doses, as well as incurring the standard attack delay from eating food. Note that [[roe]] cannot be used in mixes higher levelled than the [[stat restore mix]]; any higher level mix requires [[caviar]], which is obtained the same way as roe.\n\nLeft-clicking '''will not work''' for barbarian Herblore. The best way to avoid accidentally consuming the fish eggs is to position them in the bottom row of the inventory so that one can select the \"use\" option immediately after right-clicking, without needing to move the cursor.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable align-center-1 align-left-2 align-center-6\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[Potions|Potion]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |{{SCP|Herblore|link=y}}\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Heals \n(per dose)\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Eggs used\n|-\n!Level\n!Exp\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Attack mix}}\n|4||8||3\n|{{plinkp|Roe}} or {{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Antipoison mix}}\n|6||12||3\n|{{plinkp|Roe}} or {{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Relicym's mix}}\n|9||14||3\n|{{plinkp|Roe}} or {{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Strength mix}}\n|14||17||3\n|{{plinkp|Roe}} or {{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Restore mix}}\n|24||21||3\n|{{plinkp|Roe}} or {{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Energy mix}}\n|29||23||3\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Defence mix}}\n|33||25||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Agility mix}}\n|37 ||27||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Combat mix}}\n|40 ||28||3\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Prayer mix}}\n|42||29||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Superattack mix}}\n|47||33||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Anti-poison supermix}}\n|51||35||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Fishing mix}}\n| 53||38||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Super energy mix}}\n|56||39||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Hunting mix}}\n| 58||40 ||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Super str. mix}}\n| 59||42|| 6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Magic essence mix}}\n| 61||43|| 6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Super restore mix}}\n| 67||48 ||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Super def. mix}}\n|71|| 50||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Antidote+ mix}}\n|74||52||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Antifire mix}}\n|75||53||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Ranging mix}}\n| 80||54||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Magic mix}}\n|83||57||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Zamorak mix}}\n|85||58||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Stamina mix}}\n|86||60||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Extended antifire mix}}\n|91||61||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Ancient mix}}\n| 92||63||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Super antifire mix}}\n|98||70||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Extended super antifire mix}}\n| 99||78||6\n|{{plinkp|Caviar}}\n|}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of barbarian training is required for the following:\n*[[Dragon Slayer II]] - Partial completion of barbarian Firemaking is required in order to access the [[Ancient Cavern]].\n*[[Hard Kandarin Diary]]\n*[[Elite Kandarin Diary]]\n*[[Elite Morytania Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 8 May 2024\n|update = Project Rebalance: Skilling & Poll 81 MTA Changes\n|change = Barbarian potions can now use the Make-all functionality.

The [[player]] needs to assemble Willow's old team, which is capable of opening the doors and gaining entry to what lies beyond...\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = [[Willow (Below Ice Mountain)|Willow]] on the path south of [[Ice Mountain]]\n|startmap = 3002,3436\n|difficulty = Novice\n|description = Willow, an energetic archaeologist (perhaps suspiciously so) is hunting for her next big discovery. She believes she has found the entrance to ancient underground ruins found to the west of Ice Mountain. There's a catch though - the entrance is sealed tight and she needs to re-unite her old crew to help her break in. Naturally, she has to stay close to the ruins in order to lay claim to the find, so it falls to you to bring her rag-tag group back together for one last caper and a final big pay-off.\n\nBurntof is an old dwarf with a penchant for demolition, Checkal is a well-built lifter of heavy things and Marley is a cunning thief with a knack for disarming traps.\n\nTogether, they have the talents it will take to gain entry to the secret ruins. But persuading them might not be easy. See, the gang aren't all too keen on working with Willow again, and her intentions might not be as honourable as she claims...\n|length = Short\n|requirements = *{{SCP|Quest|16|link=yes}} {{Questreqstart|yes}}\n|items = * [[Cooked meat]] (can be obtained during the quest)\n* [[Bread]]\n* [[Knife]]\n* [[Beer]] (can be obtained during the quest)\n** Alternatively [[Asgarnian ale]], [[Dwarven stout]], or a [[Wizard's mind bomb]]\n|recommended = * {{SCP|Combat|15|link=yes}}\n* [[Armour]] and some [[food]]\n* [[Pickaxe]] and {{SCP|Mining|10|link=yes}} {{Boostable|Yes}} to kill the [[Ancient Guardian]] without combat\n* Fast travel to Falador ([[Falador teleport]])\n* Fast travel to Varrock ([[Varrock teleport]], [[Chronicle]] or ''([[members]] only)'' [[combat bracelet]] to the Champions' Guild)\n* Fast travel to Edgeville, the Ice Mountain and the Barbarian Village ([[Skull Sceptre]] or [[Chronicle]] PLUS a woodcutting axe for [[Canoe]] or ''(members only)'' [[combat bracelet]] to the Monastery or [[amulet of glory]] to Edgeville)\n* [[Energy potion]]s or ''(members only)'' [[stamina potion]]s\n* ''(Members only)'' [[Weight-reducing clothing]]\n|kills = [[Ancient Guardian]] ''(level 25)'' ('''Note:''' You can skip the fight with a [[pickaxe]] and {{SCP|Mining|10|link=yes}} {{Boostable|Yes}})\n|leagueRegion = <poem>\nUnlocking {{RE|Asgarnia}} {{okay}} will auto-complete the quest\nUnlocking {{RE|Desert}} {{okay}} will auto-complete the quest\n</poem>\n}}\n\n==Walkthrough==\n===Willow the 'archaeologist'===\n[[File:Willow (Below Ice Mountain) chathead.png|left]]\nSpeak to [[Willow (Below Ice Mountain)|Willow]], north-east of Falador and south of the [[Dwarven Mine]] entrance by [[Ice Mountain]]. A self-proclaimed 'archaeologist', she will tell the player that she has found a set of doors beneath a tonne of rocks, and asks for their help, as she cannot leave the area in fear of another 'archaeologist' claiming the credit for her discovery.\n\nAgree to help Willow, and she'll need you to convince her old 'excavation team' to help her, since they had a falling out with Willow. Her mates, [[Burntof]], [[Checkal]] and [[Marley]], can be spoken to in any order.\n\n===Checkal the strongman===\n[[File:Below Ice Mountain workout scene.png|thumb|right|The trials of the strongman.]]\n[[File:Checkal chathead.png|left]]\n[[Checkal]]  can be found in the centre of [[Barbarian Village]]. In order to get him to join Willow, the player must prove their strength by training with his old friend [[Atlas]], who can be found in [[The Long Hall]] tavern in Barbarian Village.\n\nSpeak to Checkal. He will refer the player to Atlas, who will agree to train them. A long cutscene of training regimens will ensue, which afterward will unlock the [[Flex]] emote. Before returning to Checkal, grab a [[beer]] and [[meat]] from the table if you have not obtained it already.\n\nReturn to Checkal and use the Flex emote when prompted, and he will agree to help Willow.\n\n===Burntof, master of explosives===\n{{Needed|3 [[coins]] or a [[beer]]}}\n[[File:Burntof chathead.png|left]]\n[[Burntof]] can be found in the [[Rising Sun Inn]] in [[Falador]]. Drunk as he is, he will ask the player for a drink. If you have not already picked up the beer from Barbarian Village, purchase one from the bartender and give it to Burntof.\n\nBurntof will agree to join the team if the player manages to beat him in a best-of-three game of rock paper scissors. Regardless of what is chosen, Burntof will agree to help Willow as he is too drunk to properly play the game.\n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Marley the thief===\n{{Needed|[[knife]], [[cooked meat]] and [[bread]]}}\n[[File:Marley chathead.png|left]]\nThough Willow instructs the player to speak to [[Charlie the Tramp]] to find Marley's whereabouts, you can skip this conversation and directly reach [[Marley]] in the [[Edgeville]] ruins, by the yew trees south of Edgeville bank.\n\nHe will want a [[steak sandwich]] from the [[Blue Moon Inn]] in order to help Willow. However, he was banned from the inn and the cook won't make him another one. Thus, the player must go to the inn in his place.\n\nSpeak to the [[Cook (Blue Moon Inn)|cook]] in the east room of Blue Moon Inn in [[Varrock]]. Though he will still refuse to make a steak sandwich due to Marley trying to steal from one of their patrons, he will tell the player the 'delicate art' of creating a steak sandwich: using a [[knife]] on [[cooked meat]] while having [[bread]] in your inventory.\n\nWith the steak sandwich beautifully and masterfully created, return to Marley with it in your inventory. He will now agree to help Willow.\n\n===The Ruins of Camdozaal===\n[[File:Below Ice Mountain 2.png|thumb|The crew assembled prepares to enter.]]\n{{Needed|Some food for low combat players, and any [[pickaxe]] '''or''' a [[weapon]] and [[armour]] to kill a level 25 monster}}\nWith the crew assembled, head to the [[Blocked entry|ancient doors]] at the west side of [[Ice Mountain]] (marked by the dungeon icon on the minimap), and talk to Willow. The crew will begin unblocking the entrance, with Burntof blowing up the rocks, Checkal moving the debris, and Marley disabling the traps within.\n[[File:Below Ice Mountain 3.png|thumb|left|Willow's treachery is revealed, whilst Burntof finds the ruins rather familiar.]]\nThough the player becomes fascinated at the potential historical value of the ruins, Willow reveals that they are not actually archaeologists, but grave robbers hoping to find valuable loot. Now that the player knows, she can't risk being revealed to the authorities and prepares to kill them. However, Burntof accidentally sets off a trap, awakening the [[Ancient Guardian]]. Having bit off more than they can chew, the four crew members flee.\n[[File:Below Ice Mountain 4.png|thumb|Fighting the Ancient Guardian.]]\nAfter the cutscene ends, kill the level 25 [[Ancient Guardian]]. You can choose to kill it through standard combat, but lower levelled players are recommended to mine the four [[structural pillar]]s in the corners of the room; this will cause some rocks to fall down, damage the golem and ultimately kill it. When using the mining method, the guardian will constantly hit the player, so bring enough food. Alternatively, the guardian can be safespotted by hugging the east wall by the ruins' exit.\n\nAfter defeating the golem, the player will loot some items from [[Willow's bag]], which she left behind in a panic. However, the doors leading deeper into the mountain open, revealing a dwarf named [[Ramarno]]. Being one of the few [[Imcando dwarves]] to have survived the [[Runecrafting Crusades]], Ramarno has since lived isolated inside these ruins: the [[Ruins of Camdozaal]].\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Below Ice Mountain\n|image = \n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*2,000 coins\n*Access to the [[Ruins of Camdozaal]]\n*[[Flex]] emote\n*The ability to make a [[steak sandwich]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\n* [[Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire]]\n* [[Defender of Varrock]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==[[Music]] unlocked==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Unlock details\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Music track\n!

This is a reference to the 1976 film ''{{WP|Rocky}}''.\n**At the end of the workout cutscene, the player runs up the castle steps and does the [[Cheer]] emote, a reference to the iconic step-climbing scene in the same film.\n*[[Atlas]], an NPC in the quest, is a reference to the titan {{WP|Atlas (mythology)|Atlas}} who was condemned to hold the sky (often misunderstood as the earth) on his shoulders.\n**It's also possible that Atlas is a reference to {{WP|Charles Atlas}}, a bodybuilder who got famous for creating a set of exercises called {{WP|Dynamic Tension}}.\n*If the player has 99 [[Strength]], they will remark that they are a master of strength when [[Willow (Below Ice Mountain)|Willow]] states the rubble will need to be moved from the explosion. This does not affect the quest.\n*Aside from regular [[beer]], [[Burntof]] can be given the other drinks sold by the [[Rising Sun Inn]] ([[Asgarnian ale]], [[dwarven stout]], [[wizard's mind bomb]]). He has different remarks for each drink type.\n**Initially he could not be given [[Asgoldian ale]] as a substitute, but this was corrected in a subsequent update.\n*While talking to [[Ramarno]] post-quest he states that he's the last [[Imcando dwarf]]; this isn't true, as [[Thurgo]] is also an Imcando dwarf. If the player talks to Ramarno next to his forge after meeting Thurgo in [[The Knight's Sword]], they will inform him of this when asking about the Imcando dwarfs.\n*After the quest, [[members]] can travel to [[Nardah]] to find Willow and her crew in hiding, scoping out their next grave to rob.\n*While the [[2022 Christmas event]] was active, the player model was invisible during part of the Atlas training cutscene due to the festive override.\n\n{{Below Ice Mountain}}"

She will tell you that she has an exclusive item from her shop for you as thanks for helping the people of Sophanem; agree to begin the quest. As she tries fitting the item, a gold ring, on your finger, she will sneakily give you a [[Message (Beneath Cursed Sands)|message]] and proceed to tell you the ring is too small for you, acting as if nothing had happened. Read the message to find out that the sender wishes to meet you at a campsite by the cliffs east of the city.\n[[File:Beneath Cursed Sands - arriving at the old necropolis.png|thumb|280px|The player and Maisa arrive at the necropolis.]]\nMake your way to the campsite, which is directly north of the small mining site by the cliffs. Here, you will find that [[Maisa]], a spy from [[Al Kharid]] you met during the [[Contact!]] quest, was the one who asked for you. She will tell you that citizens from [[Menaphos]] have been bypassing the quarantine of the city and excavating the old [[necropolis]] south of [[Sophanem]]. In addition, upon visiting the necropolis, she found the behaviour of the citizens to be unusual. She will ask you to come with her there; agree to do so, and a cutscene will play. If you accidentally cancel the cutscene, make sure you speak to [[Maisa]] again to trigger it, otherwise you will not be able to advance to the next cutscene.\n\nAfter the cutscene, you'll appear at the [[necropolis]]. You will see many citizens and Menaphite Guards excavating the area. If you have the [[Pharaoh's sceptre]] with you, you can commune with the [[Obelisk (Necropolis)|obelisk]] directly north of the [[necropolis mine]] to allow teleportation back here, via the \"Jaltevas\" teleport option on the sceptre.\n[[File:Beneath Cursed Sands - fighting Head Menaphite Guard.png|thumb|left|280px|The Head Menaphite Guard disables the player's protection prayers.]]\nHead to the [[Jaltevas Pyramid]] south-east, and inspect the blocked entry. After that, talk to a citizen or Menaphite Guard, and a cutscene will play, where the [[Head Menaphite Guard]] and two [[Menaphite Guard]]s will confront you. Maisa will instantly kill one Menaphite Guard, and begins fighting the other. Meanwhile, you will fight the Head Menaphite Guard.\n\nThe Head Menaphite Guard will attack with melee and can deal up to 16 damage. '''Do not''' use any overhead protection prayers as he will otherwise yell {{overhead|Your false gods will not protect you!}} and damage you for 33% of your Hitpoints level. While the Head Menaphite Guard cannot be safespotted as he will manoeuvre around obstacles to hit the player, you can use a hit-and-run strategy using any ranged weapon or combat spell while running around a neighboring cluster of rocks to prevent him from coming into melee distance. Iban's Blast is quite effective for low-level Ironmen.\n\nAfter defeating him, he will snap out of his trance and tell you and Maisa that [[Amascut]] was responsible for hypnotising the Menaphites and unblocking the tomb in the Jaltevas Pyramid and that she is currently inside. He will also tell you that [[scabarites]] assisted her and that they came from some ruins to the north-east. Maisa will then ask you to head back to her camp.\n\n===The Ruins of Ullek===\n{{Needed|Combat equipment, [[coal]], [[tinderbox]], [[spade]], [[iron bar]]|recommended=A means to cure/prevent poison and desert heat, food and a stamina potion}}\n[[File:Maisa chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:Beneath Cursed Sands - chest location.png|thumb|280px|The location to dig to find the chest.]]\n[[File:Beneath Cursed Sands - fighting Scarab Mages.png|thumb|280px|Scarab Mages attack the player upon climbing down the stairs in the ruins.]]\nTalk to Maisa at the camp, and she'll ask that you explore the cliffs in order to find the scabarites, while she figures out how to re-enter Menaphos. Make sure you finish the conversation with her, or you will not be able to progress to the next part. If you do not have a [[tinderbox]] for later, you can search the camping equipment by the tent to get one. A spade can also be found at the north side of the campsite.\n\nFrom the campsite, head south and then to the east, around the cliffs, where you will find a set of stairs to the [[Ruins of Ullek]]. Make your way towards the furnace next to the well. Use the [[coal]] and [[tinderbox]] on the furnace to ignite it. Next, search the well for a [[Stone tablet (Beneath Cursed Sands)|stone tablet]] and read it. The message indicates a hidden chest buried in the southernmost ritual pillar found down and south-west of the climbing steps. Dig there to receive the aforementioned [[Chest (Beneath Cursed Sands)|chest]]. The passcode to the chest, which is deciphered from the numerical order of the letters of the alphabet in the name \"Akhem\", is 1118513. The chest will contain a [[scarab mould]].\n[[File:Beneath Cursed Sands scarab map.png|thumb|303x303px|Lower floor after Scarab mages]]\nWith the scarab mould and iron bar, go back to the furnace and make an [[Scarab_emblem#Iron|iron scarab emblem]]. Then, head north and inspect the pillar in front of the stairway to insert the emblem. An interface will open up to rotate the emblem; rotate the scarab on it until it faces down. The entryway will now be unlocked. Climb down the stairs, and you will be attacked by two [[Scarab Mage]]s. These attack much quicker than their normal counterparts, so [[Protect from Magic]] is recommended. Shortly after beginning the fight a [[Scarab swarm]] will also spawn attacking with rapid, but weak melee attacks, also being able to inflict [[poison]]. The swarm can be ignored as they will die when the mages are killed. Upon defeating the two mages, climb down the stairs.\n\n===Riddle of the Tomb===\nAfter killing both Scarab mages, take one of the two stairs down and then follow the green arrows to the southern lever to activate it. Once the first lever is activated quickly run along the red lines to pull the other lever. You must hit both levers within 60 seconds to continue to the next area. If you are hit by the projectiles fired down the hallways by the [[Tomb wall]]s, you will be stunned and take up to 10 [[damage]].\n\nNote that if you die during this portion, you may find that your first time successfully pulling the levers won't unlock the door; simply pull them again within 60 seconds of each other to fix this.\n\nReturn to the junction and enter through the previously locked door. Inspect the south-western plaque and you will find four emblems depicting a [[Human emblem|human]], [[Scarab emblem|scarab]], [[Crocodile emblem|crocodile]], and [[Baboon emblem|baboon]]. The emblems need to be put into the urns in the correct order; a plaque to the north-west, will give a riddle, hinting of the order where each emblem is to be placed.\n[[File:Beneath Cursed Sands - urn riddle.png|thumb|280px|The riddle indicating where to put the urns, which is random for each player.<br><br>In this example, the solution would be to place the baboon, crocodile, scarab, and human emblems from the northern to southern urns.]]\nThe order of urns is randomised, but doesn't change if you leave the tomb and come back. To solve the riddle, use the table below and place the emblems in the urns that correspond to the following:\n\n* \"To the one that arrived first, he offered '''item 1'''.\" – Place the emblem corresponding to '''item 1''' in the '''centre-south urn'''.\n* \"The one that was offered '''item 2''' came from just south...\" – Place the emblem corresponding to '''item 2''' in the '''southernmost urn'''.\n* \"The '''god 1''' arrived just before the '''god 2'''...\" – Place the emblem corresponding to '''god 1''' in the '''northernmost urn''' and the emblem corresponding to '''god 2''' in the '''centre-north urn'''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Emblem\n!God\n!Item\n|-\n|Scarab\n|Isolation\n|Carving\n|-\n|Human\n|Health\n|Wine\n|-\n|Crocodile\n|Resourcefulness\n|Necklace\n|-\n|Baboon\n|Companionship\n|Linen\n|}\nOnce you have put the emblems into their correct urns, pull the lever to the south-west  and continue to the next area. If the emblems are in the wrong order when pulling the lever, you will take high damage, be poisoned, and have your stats temporarily decreased. However, the riddle will not be reset, so you can just try again if needed.\n\nSpeak with the spirit, who reveals himself to be [[Mehhar]], the son of [[Osmumten]]. He will reveal that the [[Jaltevas Pyramid|pyramid]] at the necropolis is the tomb of Osmumten, and that the divine weapons buried with him inside are likely what [[Amascut]] is seeking. He will also offer some insight on the history of the [[Kharidian Desert]] during the [[Second Age]].\n\nLastly, he will ask that you free the [[High Priest of Scabaras]] from Amascut's influence by way of an incantation. You do not need to record the incantation, as your character remembers it automatically. Afterwards, search the urn at the back of the room to obtain a [[rusty key]].\n\n===The Champion of Scabaras===\n{{Needed|recommended=Ranged combat gear, 4-6 doses of stamina potion + 1 antipoison OR 6-8 strange fruits, prayer potions, food|Rusty Key}}\n[[File:Champion of Scabaras chathead.png|left]]\nReturn to the upper level of the dungeon and be prepared to fight a level 379 boss - the [[Champion of Scabaras]]. The champion is highly resistant to magic, and fairly resistant against melee; as such, ranged is recommended for this fight. Bringing a [[stamina potion]] and some form of antipoison is advised. \n\nRun energy is also important for this fight since you will most likely be kiting him between the four corners of the room. [[Explorer's ring|Explorer's Ring]] allows 50% restoration of energy which is extremely useful. Strange fruits, which can be stolen from the [[Fruit Stall|fruit stalls]] outside of [[Logava Gricoller's Cooking Supplies]] in [[Hosidius]], restore run energy and cure poison at the same time - since you will be kiting the entire fight, you will need 150+ points of energy.\n\nWhen ready, unlock the door upstairs to begin the fight. The door leading to the Champion of Scabaras stays unlocked after using the rusty key, even if the player leaves the combat area by teleports or death. If players die during the fight, their gravestone will be found by the tomb's entrance on the surface.\n\n==== The Champion ====\nIt is advised to pray [[Protect from Magic]] throughout the fight, and stay out of melee range of the Champion to avoid its shadow burst. Moving in a rectangular path around the walls of the room with ''Longrange'' ranged attacks is highly effective for keeping distance.\n\nThe Champion of Scabaras will attack with magical shadow attacks and melee up close. After several normal attacks, it will use one of three special attacks.\n\nPlayers should kill the Shadow Rift and scarab swarms when they appear, but the first priority should always be maintaining distance from the Champion. If using a crossbow, both [[Ruby bolts (e)|enchanted ruby]] and [[Diamond bolts (e)|diamond]] bolts are very useful due to their special effects. Crossbows are recommended over lower accuracy weapons such as the [[toxic blowpipe]], due to the Champion's high defence.[[File:Beneath Cursed Sands - Champion shadow burst.png|thumb|280px|The Champion of Scabaras' Shadow Burst attack.]]\n\n==== Special Attacks ====\n* '''Shadow Burst''' - The Champion will cast a shadow beneath itself, then proceed to send out a burst of shadow magic. This has a reach of 4 tiles, and can hit over 40 damage multiple times (less if further away from the champion). It is advised to stay out of melee range of the Champion throughout the fight to avoid this attack, as he cannot be frozen due to his magic immunity.\n* '''Shadow Rift''' - The Champion will shout {{overhead|We are born in the shadows!}} and summon a [[Shadow Rift]] within the arena. The rift has 20 Hitpoints and will explode after a few seconds, dealing 35+ damage regardless of distance from it, so it is recommended to quickly destroy it; however some players may find it easier to pre-eat and tank this attack, focusing instead on continuing to attack the Champion.\n* '''Shadow Flames''' - The Champion will shout {{overhead|The children of Scabaras are eternal!}} and a poisonous [[Scarab Swarm (Beneath Cursed Sands)|scarab swarm]] will appear. The swarm has 5 Hitpoints and leaves dark fire in its path, which will hurt when stood upon. It is advised to kill the swarm as fast as possible as the fire will linger and hinder movement if left unattended.\n\nAfter defeating the Champion, speak to the [[High Priest of Scabaras]]. You will free him from Amascut's influence, and he will reveal that with their help, Amascut has captured the lesser gods and brought them into Osmumten's tomb. He will also tell you that the Pharaoh is also being controlled by Amascut, and that she needed the city to be quarantined for reasons unknown. Lastly, he admits to releasing locusts and frogs, as well as the poisoning of the cows, though he is unaware of the pox infections.\n\n===Cure Me Pox===\n{{Needed|[[Raw beef]] or [[cooked meat]]|recommended=A means to combat [[desert heat]]}}\n[[File:Zahur chathead.png|left]]\nAfter speaking to the High Priest of Scabaras, head to [[Zahur]]'s shop in [[Nardah]], directly south of the fountain. She and [[Maisa]] will tell you that the pox originates from the bark of a [[cadavaberry bush]] and that it can be easily treated. You will corroborate this with your discoveries in the Ruins of Ullek, and you will be asked to retrieve a [[Lily of the Elid]] for the pox cure, which can be found on an island west of Nardah while Maisa goes to collect the scarab poison needed. If you don't already have [[raw beef]] or [[cooked meat]], purchase one from the [[Nardah General Store]] as you'll need it shortly.\n[[File:Beneath Cursed Sands - Lily of the Elid location.png|thumb|280px|The island in which the Lily of the Elid grows. A hungry crocodile guards the way.]]\nHead west until you reach the [[River Elid]] and see an island with lilies growing on it. Attempt to jump to the stepping stones, and throw the meat at the crocodile (who you affectionately name \"[[Roger]]\"). Pick the lily and return to Zahur's shop. She will begin to make the cure, and ask that you warm up her chemistry equipment by adjusting the individual heats until the overall temperature is at the marked level. '''Note: pressing \"-\" on the middle heat pushes the two side bars up.''' Raise the middle and right bar all the way, then alternate lowering the right bar and the middle bar until completed.\n\nOnce done, Zahur will complete the cure and ask that you take the [[cure crate]] to the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]] in [[Sophanem]]. Make your way there and deliver the cure.\n\n===Fight with the Menaphite Akh ===\n{{Needed|Melee armour, 2-3 prayer potions/super restores, a (super) combat potion, and an accurate melee weapon}}\n[[File:Menaphite Akh chathead.png|left]]\nBefore heading to the [[necropolis]], gear up in your best melee equipment for a fight against a level 351 boss. When ready, speak with Maisa in the northern part of the necropolis, just south-east of the bottom right corner of [[Sophanem]]. Players with the [[Pharaoh's sceptre]] can use it to teleport to the obelisk if they have communed with it as mentioned above.\n\nA cutscene will play where you chant the incantation and free everyone in the necropolis from Amascut's influence. All but two citizens leave, who wish to help you mine the blockage to Osmumten's tomb to help you defeat Amascut. You and Maisa will then return to her camp, where she discovers [[Osman]] spying on her. Enraged, she leaves, leaving you and Osman alone. You will argue with him about Maisa and your actions, while he keeps believing that this is all a plot by the Pharaoh to keep Al Kharid divided. As this happens, the ground shakes and lightning strikes the sand, causing scarlet flames to burn around. A [[Menaphite Akh]] will appear to kill you, while Osman disappears.\n\n==== The Akh ====\n[[File:Beneath Cursed Sands - fighting Menaphite Akh.png|thumb|280px|The Menaphite Akh's lightning attack.]]\nThe [[Menaphite Akh]] attacks with [[melee]], using a [[dragon scimitar]], and will also use special attacks. She is '''''highly''''' resistant to [[ranged]] and [[magic]], making melee the best option for damage. Additionally, the Akh cannot be frozen with ice spells, and she moves at running speed, making it difficult to use long-distance combat.\n\nThe Menaphite Akh is weakest against stab attacks meaning the player is advised to use their best stab weapon using one of the stab attack styles for that weapon. For example: an [[abyssal dagger]] is superior to an [[abyssal whip]].  \n\nWith [[Protect from Melee]] activated, damage from the Akh's regular melee attacks are greatly reduced, meaning she will only be able to deal major damage with her special attacks. It is highly advised to bring two or three [[prayer potion]]s or [[super restore]]s in order to keep prayer active throughout the fight. Combat potions are also recommended. \n\nNote that thralls '''cannot''' be used in the arena; additionally, the Akh is immune to [[Vengeance]] and damage from the rings of [[ring of recoil|recoil]] or [[ring of suffering|suffering]].\n\nIf you leave the fight, speak to [[Osman]] just outside Maisa's camp to restart the fight. If players die during the fight, they can return to Maisa's camp just north of the mining symbol and reclaim their items from a gravestone just south of Osman. \n\n==== Special Attacks ====\nEvery 7 rounds of actions (including regular attacks, summoning a shadow, or translocation), the Akh twitches, performing a lightning bolt attack that will move multiple tiles out in front of her. This attack can hit up to 80 if not evaded, and frequently hits in the high 60s.\n\n* '''''Always be prepared to walk behind or beside her to avoid this attack; players must move within 2 game ticks of the animation starting in order to avoid damage.'''''\n\nDuring the fight she will also summon a [[Menaphite Shadow]], which will step out from under her and move away. The Shadow attacks with ranged for the first half of the Akh's health, and then switches to a more accurate magic attack for the remaining half. \n\nThe Akh will sometimes swap places with the Shadow and begin channeling an attack; make sure you attack the Akh ('''NOT''' the shadow) to interrupt this, otherwise you will take a large amount of damage. You will take this damage even after the shadow has been killed, if the screen darkening animation has begun (a chat box message will state \"Darkness begins to surround you!\" and the screen will begin to turn dark). If you defeat the Akh and the shadow is still alive, it will disappear.\n\n==== Low-level strategy ====\nLower-levelled players and ironmen having difficulty with defeating the Menaphite Akh will likely find ignoring the Menaphite Shadow to be easier.\n\nAt the beginning of the fight, pray Protect from Melee and focus only on the Akh. The Shadow attacks with Ranged, however melee armour will resist this. Always be prepared to avoid the Lightning attack. When the Akh starts the channelling attack (dark screen) and swaps places with the shadow, immediately run and hit the Akh to stop the channeling attack. Once the Akh reaches half health (240 hitpoints), the Shadow will switch to attacking with Magic, so switch your prayer to Protect from Magic. It is recommended to play with sounds on to hear when the Shadow switches attack styles. Continue the fight avoiding the Lightning and interrupting the Channeling attacks. Upon defeating the Akh, the Shadow will automatically despawn.  \n\n=== Finishing up ===\nAfter defeating the [[Menaphite Akh]], Osman will still not believe that Amascut is responsible, though he acknowledges that there's more to all of this than he realised, and suggests you speak to Maisa, who likely has gone to Sophanem, and leaves. Return to Sophanem, and speak with the [[High_Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]] or [[Maisa]]. The High Priest will thank you for ending the plagues for good and invites you to meet the Menaphites at the bridge, which you and Maisa accept. A cutscene will then play with the two groups meeting, before [[Pharaoh Kemesis]] himself appears, surprising the High Priest. He announces that Menaphos will prepare to end the quarantine and leaves as quickly as he arrives.\n\n'''Note:''' Make sure to have an inventory space available before speaking with Maisa or the High Priest, otherwise you will not receive the [[Keris partisan]] as a reward. If you did not have a space available, Maisa will leave the partisan inside her tent at her campsite by the [[Ruins of Ullek]]. You can also retrieve this partisan from [[Selim]].\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nBeneath Cursed Sands - freeing the Menaphites.png|The player and Maisa confront the Menaphites in the necropolis.\nBeneath Cursed Sands - Osman appears.png|Maisa confronts Osman, who appears after she detects his invisibility spell.\nBeneath Cursed Sands - the Menaphite Akh appears.png|The Menaphite Akh appears to kill the player.\nBeneath Cursed Sands - Pharaoh Kemesis appears.png|Pharaoh Kemesis himself appears to announce preparations to end the quarantine.\n</gallery>\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Beneath Cursed Sands\n|image = \n|qp = 2\n|rewards =\n*{{SCP|Agility|50,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*Access to the [[Tombs of Amascut]]\n*A [[Keris partisan]].

You can get there in several different ways:\n\n* [[Fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|dks}}, which can be found north-east of [[Rellekka]]. \n* You can use the [[enchanted lyre]] for easy access, or, if your house is in Rellekka, you can also teleport there. \n* Take the [[Keldagrim minecart system|minecart]] from the [[Grand Exchange]]. If doing so, go north-west from the carts to the [[Dwarven Boatman]] and take the boat (free) to reach the ferryman at the entrance.\n\nOnce you've entered the cave, there will be a crack between two dwarf statues directly across from you, which you should enter. From there, talk to the [[Dwarven Ferryman]] ('''not the boatman''') for a ride across the river, which will cost 2 [[coins]] or be free if you have a [[ring of charos (a)]] equipped.\n\nGo east and around the rock wall and then go west until you reach and cross the bridge that leads to [[Dondakan the Dwarf|Dondakan]]'s Rock and his [[Dwarf Multicannon]]. \n\nSpeak to [[Dondakan]] to begin the quest. The necessary conversation options to do so are as follows:\n\n# ''\"Why are you firing a cannon at a wall?\"'' \n# ''\"So why were you trying to get through the rock again?\"''\n# ''\"Sounds interesting!\"''\n\n[[File:Keldagrim map.png|thumb|244x244px|The dwarven boatman and ferryman are south of the River Kelda at the docks. Dondakan can be reached via the ferryman and going north.]]Dondakan will then ask you to get further information about the rock and tell you to talk to the Librarian. Return to the other side of the river, paying 2 coins again or crossing for free with the ring. This time, speak with the '''Boatman''' to be taken to Keldagrim. If you have not started [[The Giant Dwarf]], you will be presented with a small cutscene introducing the area. You will then be taken by guards, giving you the option to start The Giant Dwarf.\n\nYou can talk to the Librarian on the Western side of Keldagrim, but it won't do much other than specifying who to speak with. Instead, go into the western part of the [[Trading Consortium]]. Look for the area with an [[anvil]] on the minimap in the palace and speak with the [[Dwarven Engineer|engineer]] inside of the room it's located in. This is located within the large building '''not''' the anvil which is further west.\n\nYou will be told to speak with [[Rolad]] located in the eastern building at the [[Dwarven Mine]] entrance camp next to [[Ice Mountain]]. To get there, either teleport to [[Falador]] or the [[Edgeville Monastery|Monastery]] and walk the distance, use [[Ancient Magicks]] to teleport to Lassar, teleport to the [[Barbarian Village]] with a [[skull sceptre]], or take the mine carts located in the south-eastern portion of Keldagrim for 150 coins (75 coins if you have the ring of charos (a)). If you took the carts, head south, east, then north and exit the mine.\n\nRolad is inside the eastern house at the camp. He will ask you to find the pages from a book giving you information about the rock.\n\n:'''Note:''' Make sure to fully complete the dialogue otherwise the pages won't appear.\n\n=== Between the pages ===\n'''Items needed:''' Armour, Weapons, food, pickaxe and 3 inventory slots.\n\nAll three pages can be obtained in the [[Dwarven Mine]] in any order. Note that the pages may require multiple attempts to be obtained:\n\n#The [[Book page 1|first page]] can be found by killing [[scorpion]]s in the south-eastern area of the mines. (Try switching worlds if killing a scorpion doesn't give you page 1)\n#*'''Tip:''' Squeeze through the narrow crevice (level 42 Agility) to complete a [[Medium Falador Diary|medium Falador diary]] task when returning to Rolad from the SE area of the mine.\n#You can find the [[Book page 2|second page]] by searching the mine carts along the tracks\n#The [[Book page 3|third page]] is found by mining [[Clay rocks|clay]], [[Copper rocks|copper]], [[Tin rocks|tin]], or [[iron rocks]] inside the mine.\n\nReturn to Rolad when you have found all three [[pages]], and he will give you the [[Dwarven lore]]. \n\nRoald will ask you to give back the book because he want to study it. You can answer '''\"Of course\"''' or '''\"Of course. (lie)\"''' Choose to lie and read the book, and '''keep it for later'''. If you need an [[ammo mould]], purchase it from [[Nulodion]] in the western house next door to Rolad.\n\nHead back to Dondakan using one of the methods first used to reach him and speak with him until you get a short cutscene where he kicks the rock to no avail. He then tells you that he wants a material that is stronger than [[runite]] and [[granite]]. This is where your [[gold bar]]s come in handy. Show him your gold bar by using it on him.\n\n:'''Note:''' You can also show him a [[gold ore]] instead. If you have forgotten to bring one, there is a [[gold vein]] in the cave south of Dondakan's.\n\nGo to any [[furnace]] with a gold bar and your cannonball ammo mould, and make a [[Cannon ball (Between a Rock...)|golden cannonball]]. The closest furnace on foot is the one in Rellekka, which you can use if you have completed [[The Fremennik Trials]]. However, it's much quicker to teleport. You can also find a furnace at [[Zanaris]]. Another option is to take the fairy ring to Edgeville, or head back to the mine carts in South-east Keldagrim and take Cart 3 to the Grand Exchange; then, use the furnace in Edgeville by using the shortcut from the Grand Exchange to Edgeville (21 [[Agility]] required). You can also use an [[amulet of glory]] to reach Edgeville, and take any above given option to return to Dondakan. Teleport to Falador also puts you a few steps from a furnace.\n\n'''Tip:'''  if you want a trophy cannonball in your bank, do not make multiple cannonballs at once with the [[drop trick]] since your character can only carry one at a time; the only way to carry more than one gold cannonball is to telegrab the cannonballs you dropped one by one.\n\nWhen you are finished, give the cannonball to Dondakan by using it on him. When he fires it, the cannonball will disappear through the wall. He will then ask to fire '''you''' through the wall, but he needs the schematics in order to change the cannon to be able to fire a human. You will also need to make yourself a [[gold helmet]] (requires 50 Smithing) if you don't want your head to explode when you hit the wall.\n\n:'''Tip:''' Smithing a golden helmet in the [[Resource Area]] is a medium [[Wilderness Diary]] task.\n\n=== Breakthrough design ===\n'''Items needed:''' 3 gold bars and a hammer.\n\n'''Items recommended:''' Teleport to Camelot or Games necklace or 100 coins\n\n'''Tip:''' Bring 3 extra gold bars if you want your own golden helmet.\n\nThere are a set of four (4) schematics:\n\n#The first [[Schematic (Dondakan)|schematic]] is given to you by Dondakan.\n#The [[Schematics (Dwarf Engineer)|second one]] is given by the engineer you spoke to earlier back in Keldagrim, by the anvil in the western palace bottom floor. \n#Before moving on, you can make your [[Gold helmet|golden helmet]] by the anvil. The helmet weighs quite a bit so it's a good idea to get it in the bank before you move on.\n#*'''Tip:'''  if you want a trophy [[Gold helmet|golden helmet]] in your bank, drop them one by one, then telegrab them.\n#Read to the last page of the Dwarven lore book, and you will find another [[Base schematics|schematic page]].\n#Teleport to [[Camelot]], go east, and enter the shortcut that goes under [[White Wolf Mountain]]. (Or use a games necklace and walk south a bit and down a ladder ) Go to the small bar area, and speak with [[Khorvak]]. He will ask for a [[dwarven stout]]. You can take one off the table and give it to him by using it on him, or refuse and enjoy a funny piece of dialogue about ''RuneScape'' and alcoholics. Either way, you will receive the [[Schematics (Khorvak)|final schematic]]. '''Note: <u>You cannot</u>''' take the minecart from Keldagrim to White Wolf Mountain during the quest. You can only travel from White Wolf Mountain to Keldagrim (''this ride costs 100 coins for one trip)''.\nOnce you have all schematics, click 'assemble' on the one Dondakan gave you. You will be shown all schematics, but they will not make any sense. What you must do here is move the schematics one by one so that they fit with the original schematic. Select and show one at a time, rotate and move them to fit. It may be easiest to use the human stick figure legs, torso, and head to position each of the pieces correctly. This part should be quite simple. Be aware that even if you move the pieces in the correct relative position, you might need to select them all and move them together to the correct position on the screen. Once you put them all in place, the screen will show: ''\"That's it! It all makes sense now! If you were a dwarf, that is...\"''.[[File:Between a Rock... schematics.png|frame|centre]]\n[[File:Between a Rock... second thoughts.png|thumb|220px|Second thoughts before launch...]]\n\n===Riddle of the rock===\n[[File:Between a Rock... open fire.png|thumb|220px|...

Otherwise, it will keep regenerating its hitpoints. ''Mining 15 pieces of gold is highly recommended as this will lower the combat level of the boss from 125 to 75.'' '''The gold must remain in your inventory.''' '''You only have eight 8 minutes to mine the gold AND defeat the avatar; if you take off your gold helmet, you will be teleported back to Dondakan.'''\n\n'''Note:''' Mining a gold rock here will grant you the achievement for the [[Medium Fremennik Diary]]. You will not need to revisit the mine after the quest.\nEquip the golden helmet; make sure you have a pickaxe because '''any gold ore/ingots in your inventory will disappear'''. Go back to Dondakan with the schematics and the items needed to kill the level 75-125 enemy. Once you are ready, ask Dondakan to shoot you into the rock.\n\n[[File:Between a Rock... fighting arzinian avatar.png|thumb|220px|left|Fighting the Arzinian Avatar]]\nWhen you feel you have enough gold ore, go to the centre of the area, where you will find a set of flames. Go through the first set of flames and talk to the second set. While talking to the flames, the [[Arzinian Avatar]] will attack.\n\nThe avatar will appear in one of three forms for the duration of the fight. The form chosen is usually based on your highest combat stat, though there is additionally a small chance to instead pick another form. The form that appears will determine the attack style of the boss:\n\n*[[Arzinian Avatar of Magic]] if your highest combat stat is [[Strength]] or [[Attack]].\n*[[Arzinian Avatar of Ranging]] if your highest combat stat is [[Magic]].\n*[[Arzinian Avatar of Strength]] if your highest combat stat is [[Ranged]]. \n\nChoose combat equipment and prayers accordingly. See [[Arzinian Avatar]] for more details.\n\nYou can use [[Prayer]] for an easy fight; the spirit shouldn't take too long to kill. If you are close to dying, you can take your gold helmet off, which will teleport you outside of the rock, next to Dondakan.\n\n'''Tip''': If you die then collect the helmet from the ground and enter the cave again. You will have to start over. <u>Remember food.</u>\n\nWhen you have defeated the spirit, you will be teleported back out of the rock. Speak to Dondakan to finish the quest. \n\n'''Note:''' If your inventory was full when defeating the boss the helmet will be dropped on the ground, take it before speaking with Dondakan or else it will disappear.\n\n'''Tip''': If you plan on obtaining the [[Music cape]], re-enter the mine to unlock the song [[In Between]].\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Between a Rock...\n|image = [[File:Between a Rock... reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Defence|5,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Mining|5,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Smithing|5,000|link=yes}} experience\n*A [[rune pickaxe]]\n*The ability to teleport to Dondakan's rock using a [[ring of wealth]]\n*You get to keep your [[gold helmet]] and can continue using it to fire yourself into the rock to access the [[Arzinian Mine]] where there are lots of [[gold rocks]] and [[gold vein]]s, and a nearby dwarf, at the river, banks the player's [[gold ore]] for a charge (he keeps 20% of the ores, rounded up, or 10% of the ores if the player has the [[ring of charos (a)]]).\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Between a Rock... is required for the following:\n*[[Medium Wilderness Diary]] (partial completion required)\n*[[Medium Fremennik Diary]] (partial completion required)\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 14 August 2024\n|update = Slayer Partners\n|change = After completing the 'Between a Rock...' quest, the 'Fire' option on Dondakan's cannon will now fire you back into his rock, allowing you skip his dialogue.

Some ways to get to him include using the [[Gnome glider]] (after completing [[One Small Favour]]), [[Feldip Hills]] [[Feldip hills teleport|teleport]] or the [[fairy ring|Fairy rings]] system ({{Fairycode|AKS}}). \n\nRantz is hungry and wants you to help him make arrows for his unusually large bow, so he can hunt the [[chompy bird]].\n\nLike any arrow, [[ogre arrow]]s need [[feather]]s, a shaft and a tip. '''Note:''' You must make the ogre arrows from scratch; otherwise, Rantz will not accept them.\n\n'''Tip:''' Take [[weapons]], [[armour]], [[food]], a [[chisel|chisel,]] an [[axe]], a [[knife]], and [[Feather|feathers]] with you when you go to talk with [[Rantz]].\n\n===Making the arrowtips===\n'''Items needed:''' [[Weapons]], [[armour]], [[food]] and a [[chisel]].\n\n'''Important:''' You need to start the quest before you can have the ability to make the arrowtips.\n*Kill a few [[wolves]] (level 64) in the crater to the south-west of [[Rantz]] for [[wolf bones]]. (Can be safespotted standing near the \"Roots\" in north-east of the swamp.)\n*Use a [[chisel]] on the wolf bones to produce [[wolfbone arrowtips|arrow tips]].\n:'''Note:''' When chiselling the wolf bones, you receive a random amount of arrowheads (2-6 estimated).\n\n===Making the shafts===\n'''Items needed:''' An [[axe]] and [[knife]].\n*Chop down a few [[Achey Tree]]s nearby for [[Achey tree logs]] (you'll need around 5 logs - [[Rantz]] himself wants 6 arrows, and you will probably want a few of your own).\n*Use a [[knife]] on the logs to produce some arrow shafts.\n\n===Making the arrows===\n'''Items needed:''' [[Feather|feathers]].\n*Use [[feather]]s on the [[Ogre arrow shaft|shafts]] to produce [[flighted ogre arrow]]s.\n*Use the [[Flighted ogre arrow|flighted ogre arrows]] with the [[wolfbone arrowtips]].\n\n===The cave===\n*Return to [[Rantz]], and give him the [[Ogre arrow|arrows]]. He then tells you about the [[Swamp Toad|swamp toads]] that his children like to play with.\n*Ask Rantz all of the questions that are listed, or else, you won't be able to open the [[Locked Ogre chest|chest]] later.\n*Enter the [[Rantz's cave|cave entrance]] north of Rantz.\n*Speak to Rantz' children ([[Fycie]] and [[Bugs]]) in the cave. They will inform you that Rantz locked their [[ogre bellows]] in the chest (keep the bellows if you plan on doing [[Mourning's End Part I]] and/or [[Recipe for Disaster]]). The chest is closed and weighted shut with a large rock.\n[[File:Big Chompy Bird Hunting - Opening the Ogre Chest.png|thumb|220px|Opening the chest.]]\n*Attempt to unlock the chest. Unsuccessful attempts will reduce your [[Strength]] by 1.\n*Search the [[Unlocked Ogre chest|chest]] to retrieve the bellows (make sure to search it right away, or it may lock again).\n\n===The inflatable toads===\n[[File:Big Chompy Bird Hunting - Bloating the toad.png|thumb|220px|Filling the bellows and using it on the toads.]]\n*Head back to the south-west of [[Rantz]], where you found the [[wolves]]. They surround a swamp. (see the first picture of the walkthrough.)\n*Use the [[bellows]] on the [[swamp bubbles]] in the swamp, at the southern end of the swamp pond. You get three shots with the gas filled bellows before it needs to be filled again. (Swamp bubbles may also be found at [[Yanille Agility dungeon]] near [[poison spider]]s.)\n*Use the bellows on a toad again to get a [[bloated toad]], and you will catch it and put it in your inventory. Get three toads. You can only carry a maximum of three bloated toads; inflating more will simply replace one toad in your inventory.\n\n===The chompy and the hunt===\n*Return to [[Rantz]] and talk to him. He will show you where you need to place the toads to lure the [[chompy bird]]s out.\n\n*'''Drop''' some toads on the spot (a yellow flashing arrow will mark it), then walk closer to Rantz. Don't stay too close to the bait, but make sure it is in visible range. On a successful lure, a chompy bird will appear. Occasionally, the lure will be unsuccessful and the bait will disappear; if this happens, drop another toad. Rantz will take a shot at it, but he will miss. He will complain that the arrows don't fly straight.\n*Talk to Rantz and offer to help shoot for him. He will agree and give you his [[ogre bow]]. (If you're quick getting the bow, the already spawned chompy bird can be killed. The ogre bow or [[comp ogre bow]] are used during Recipe for Disaster, so be sure to hold on to either if planning to do that quest too).\n*Head back down to the clearing and place another toad (it doesn't have to be on the exact tile indicated at first).\n*Wield the bow and arrows and when the bird appears, range it. If the bird doesn't appear or it flies away before you can kill it, keep placing bloated toads to lure the Chompies back.\n*Once you kill a Chompy, pluck the carcass and take the [[raw chompy]] back to Rantz. He now wants you to cook it as well. '''In order to progress, you must kill the chompy yourself.''' Purchasing a raw chompy from the [[Grand Exchange]] or another player will not allow you to move forward in the quest.\n\n===Cooking the chompy bird===\n[[File:Big Chompy Bird Hunting - Cooking the Chompy.png|thumb|220px|Cooking the Chompy!]]\n[[Rantz]] will name a special ingredient that he wants the bird to be cooked with. He will also tell you to ask the children what they would like the bird seasoned with.\n*Travel to the cave, and ask each of the two Ogre children what they want the [[Chompy]] seasoned with. In all, you will need three different ingredients, but only one bird.\n{{Map|mtype=pin|align=right|caption=Seasoning locations.\n|x:2562,y:2972,title:[[Doogle leaves]],desc:\n|x:2583,y:2965,title:[[Onion]],desc:\n|x:2584,y:2966,title:[[Tomato]],desc:\n|x:2587,y:2973,title:[[Cabbage]],desc:\n|x:2642,y:2959,title:[[Potato]],desc:\n|x:2639,y:2952,title:[[Equa leaves]],desc:\n|x:2630,y:2981,title:[[Rantz]],desc:\n}}\n*It's different from player to player what the ogres want on the Chompy, but here's a quick list of where to get it all.\n**'''[[Onion]]:''' A little bit to the west-southwest, there's a fire near the tomato spawn. The [[onions]] are growing next to the [[stool]] where you find the [[tomato]]. Right click on the grassy shoots and pick them. You may instead receive an onion seed; simply pick another plant if this happens.\n**'''[[Doogle leaves]]:''' To the west, east of the [[glider]].\n**'''[[Equa leaves]]:''' Three equa leaves spawn on a small peninsula by some [[willow tree]]s, south-east of Rantz.\n**'''[[Tomato]]:''' West-southwest of Rantz, near the ogres and in the same area as the onion plants. It spawns on top of a stool.\n**'''[[Potato]]:''' A bit south-east of Rantz near the equa leaf spawns, there are potato plants; pick one to get the potato. You may instead receive a potato seed; simply pick another plant if this happens.\n**'''[[Cabbage]]:''' Several cabbage plants are scattered throughout the area, the closest ones are either south-west of Rantz (north of the tomato and onions) or south-east of him (by the potatoes and equa leaves). You may instead receive a cabbage seed; simply pick another plant if this happens.\n*Use the bird on the spit north of Rantz while holding all three ingredients. Present Rantz with his delicious [[Seasoned chompy|seasoned cooked chompy]] bird.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Big Chompy Bird Hunting\n|image = [[File:Big Chompy Bird Hunting reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Fletching|262|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Cooking|1,470|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Ranged|735|link=yes}} experience\n*An [[ogre bow]]\n*The ability to fletch [[ogre arrow]]s\n*The ability to cook [[chompy bird]]s and earn a [[bowman hat]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Big Chompy Bird Hunting is required for the following:\n*[[Mourning's End Part I]]\n*[[Recipe for Disaster]] ([[Freeing the Lumbridge Guide|Lumbridge Guide]] & [[Freeing Skrach Uglogwee|Skrach Uglogwee]])\n*[[Zogre Flesh Eaters]]\n*[[Western Provinces Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n*[[Chompy Hunt]]\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 9 November 2022\n|update = Diversity & Inclusion Changes and Quest Speedrunning Updates\n|change = Some dialogue that was incorrectly formatted has been fixed.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*When [[Rantz]] misses the [[Chompy|bird]], he blames the \"arrows\" rather than the \"stabbers\".\n\n{{Big Chompy Bird Hunting}}"

She suggests talking to her father's friend, [[Jerico]], who keeps communication with [[West Ardougne]] via his pigeons.\n\n===Sneaking back===\n'''''Items required: '''[[Pigeon cage]], [[bird feed]], [[Gas mask|Gas Mask]]''\n\nSpeak to [[Jerico]], who lives in a house just south of the northern bank of East [[Ardougne]] and just north of the [[chapel]]. Click on the [[cupboard (Jerico's house)|cupboard]] on the north wall. Search it and you will find the required bird feed, then go behind the house to grab a [[pigeon cage]].\n\n* OPTIONAL: If you are planning on doing [[One Small Favour]], grab and bank an extra 5 pigeon cages. The cages are fairly close to the quest objective so this isn't necessary.\n\nSpeak to [[Omart]], who can be found west of [[Ceril Carnillean]]'s house in [[East Ardougne]], just south-west of the [[Ardougne Castle|castle]]. When you talk to him, he says that although he can move you over the wall, it is too risky as the watchtower guards are too close to the wall. The guards need to be distracted so that you can find an opportunity to enter the city.\n\n{{Map|mtype=polygon|2559,3267|2561,3267|2561,3262|2557,3262|2557,3264|2559,3264|caption=Omart's location.|align=left|width=250|height=250}}\n[[File:Biohazard - Releasing the pigeons.png|thumb|180px|Creating a distraction.]]\nHead to the small watchtower along the wall, directly north of [[Omart]]. Stand in the corner where the two spiked fences meet, put the [[bird feed]] on either fence, then click the cage in your inventory.\n\nGo back and talk to [[Omart]], who will call out to his assistant, [[Kilron]], to throw over the rope ladder. Climb over the ladder into [[West Ardougne]] (you must have the gas mask equipped otherwise you will not be able to progress any further with the storyline).\n\n===Infiltrating the Mourner HQ===\n[[File:Biohazard - Mourner Tunnels.png|thumb|200px|Mourner HQ is due north-east of West Ardougne.]]\n{{Needed|Combat equipment to kill the level 13 Mourner.}}\n\nHead to the [[Mourner Headquarters|Mourners' headquarters]] located in the north-eastern corner of the city. Try to enter, but you will not be allowed in due to the [[mourner]]s eating their stew, you need to find a way to distract them. Go around the headquarters to the northern part, where you can see a cauldron being cooked in the backyard. Squeeze through a [[fence (Biohazard)|gap in the fence]] into the backyard, and pick up the [[rotten apple]] laying on the ground just to the west of the fence hole.\n\nRight click on the rotten apple and use it on the stew that is brewing in the cauldron. Squeeze back through the fence and walk around to the front of the building, and attempt to go inside again. One of the mourners will tell you that you're not permitted inside because several mourners are ill with food poisoning and are waiting for a doctor.\n{{Map|2517,3274|mtype=rectangle|rectX=4|rectY=8|caption=Nurse Sarah's house.|align=right|width=120|height=120}}\nHead to [[nurse Sarah]]'s house - the large building south-west of the [[West Ardougne]] church. Search the [[cupboard (Nurse Sarah's house)|cupboard]] in the northern part of her house to obtain a [[medical gown]]. Equip the gown, and go back to the headquarters. The professional attire will easily fool the mourners into letting you into their base. For all subsequent visits to the headquarters during the quest, the gown must be worn at all times.\n\nGo upstairs and kill a mourner. A [[Key (Biohazard)|key]] will automatically be placed in the player's inventory. Use the key on the [[gate (Biohazard)|gate]] to get inside the caged room. Search the [[crate (Biohazard)|crate]] third from the left on the northern wall to find [[Elena]]'s [[distillator]].\n\n'''Note for Skillers:''' After talking to the mourner, he will start attacking. A ring of recoil will quickly take him out and the key will appear in your inventory, without the need to do any damage.\n\nGo back to [[Elena]] by climbing down the [[manhole (West Ardougne)|manhole]] in the middle of the city and climbing the mud pile, and give her the distillator. Alternatively head back to [[Kilron]] at the south-eastern corner of [[West Ardougne]]. He will help the player get back over into [[East Ardougne]].\n\n===Touch Paper from Chemist===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Falador teleport]] or [[amulet of glory]] (optional), [[brown apron]] (optional) or [[House teleport]] if your house is located in [[Rimmington]]''\n{{Map|2933,3210|mtype=rectangle|rectX=16|rectY=8|caption=The chemist's location.|align=right|width=200|height=200}}\nAfter talking to [[Elena]] and obtaining from her the [[Liquid honey]], [[ethenea]], [[sulphuric broline]], and the [[plague sample]], make your way to [[Rimmington]] via teleportation (note: the chemicals and plague sample will no longer get deleted). \n\nThere are several ways to reach Rimmington:\n\n* Walking south from [[Falador]], or walking west from [[Port Sarim]].\n* Casting [[Teleport To House]] if the [[player-owned house]] is in Rimmington.\n* A [[skills necklace]] can be used to teleport to the nearby [[Crafting Guild]].\n* A [[ring of the elements]] can be used to teleport to the crossroads south of the [[air altar]].\n* The [[fairy ring]] to the south on [[Mudskipper Point]], '''AIQ'''.\n* The ship from [[Corsair Cove]], available after starting [[The Corsair Curse]] quest.\n* The ship from [[Ardougne]] and [[Brimhaven]], costing 30 coins (halved by [[Ring of Charos (a)]] and completing [[Cabin Fever]]).\n* The [[Balloon transport system]] can be used to drop the player off just north of the [[Crafting Guild]].\n\nGo to the [[Chemist]] in western Rimmington.\n\nYou will need to have the [[plague sample]] in your inventory to talk to him about this quest. He will then give you the [[touch paper]] needed to continue.\n\n===Foresight===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Liquid honey]], [[ethenea]], [[sulphuric broline]], and the [[plague sample]].''\n\nThe chemist states that the Varrock guards are looking out for someone carrying suspicious materials. He recommends using his 3 errands runners to smuggle the items into Varrock. \n\nChancy the gambler, Da Vinci the artist, and Hops the drinker are located right outside the chemist's house crowding around a fire. Talk to each of them to give them their respective vials. If you give the wrong vial to someone, give the remaining vials to the others, speak to them all in Varrock, then return to Elena to get new vials before repeating this step.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Helper\n!Sample Vial\n!Reason\n|-\n|[[Da Vinci]]\n|[[File:Ethenea.png]][[Ethenea]]\n|Da Vinci cannot use the ethenea to create a \"work of art\".\n|-\n|[[Chancy]]\n|[[File:Liquid honey.png]][[Liquid honey]]\n|Owing to its low value, Chancy cannot wager the liquid honey in a gamble.\n|-\n|[[Hops (Biohazard)|Hops]]\n|[[File:Sulphuric broline.png]][[Sulphuric broline]]\n|Hops will not drink it because of its poisonous nature.\n|}\n\n===So far, so good===\n'''''Items required:''' 12 [[coins]] or a [[priest gown]] top and bottom, the [[plague sample]] and [[touch paper]].''\n\nGo to Varrock and equip a priest gown set (you can buy one from [[Thessalia's Fine Clothes]] for 10 coins or [[Fancy dress shop owner]]  to the north of [[Guidor]] for 12 coins), and proceed to the fenced area to the south-east. You can also speak to the Fancy dress shop owner and he will give you an old priest gown that is not good enough for sale (after reobtaining the vials).\n\nHead to the fenced-in enclosure in south-eastern Varrock. The guard will search you when you try and pass through the gate. The guard will confiscate the '''vials''' if you try and pass with them '''but the plague sample is safe to bring through'''.\n\n{{Map|3271,3392|mtype=rectangle|rectX=10|rectY=8|caption=The Dancing Donkey Inn's location.|align=right|width=250|height=250}}\nGo to the [[Dancing Donkey Inn]] (inside the gated area) with the plague sample and talk to Hops, Da Vinci, and Chancy to get the vials back. Having a full inventory will require you to obtain a new set from the chemist.\n\n'''{{Colour|red|Warning:}} <u>Do not pass back through the gate at this point or your vials will be confiscated on return!</u>'''\n\n'''If you did not bring the plague sample or papers with you, you can go to [[Varrock east bank]] and retrieve them, drop the vials at the gate, quickly run to Varrock east bank for the items, and quickly run back to pick up the vials.'''\n\nTelekinetic grab no longer works to grab the contents, if you try you're told you can't cast this spell on that object. So make sure to have both priest gown items before you enter.\n\n===Secrets===\n'''''Items required:''' The [[plague sample]], [[touch paper]], a [[priest gown]].''\n\nIf at this point you've forgotten your [[priest gown]], you can obtain one for free by talking to [[Asyff]] in the [[Fancy Clothes Store]]. Equip your [[priest gown]] and head to [[Guidor]]'s house in the south-eastern corner of the gated area. Talk to [[Guidor]] to give him the vials and sample, and tell him that [[Elena]] has sent a sample that needs to be processed. After analysing it, he will come to a surprising conclusion. He tells you that the plague is just a lie.\n\n===Return to Ardougne===\nReturn to [[Ardougne]], and talk to Elena. When you tell her that [[Guidor]] found nothing in his results, she suggests that the plague must be a hoax and that you should speak to the person on top of this - [[King Lathas]] of [[East Ardougne]]. King Lathas is located just south of Elena's house, in his throne-room on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the East [[Ardougne Castle]].\n\nWhen told that the plague is in fact a hoax, the King replies that he did it for the best of his people, and that it protects them from a \"far greater danger\". He then tells the player about the journey of [[King Tyras]] - the king of [[West Ardougne]] and King Lathas's brother - towards the west and that he has been corrupted by the [[dark lord]] after drinking from the Chalice of Eternity. Hence, the wall has been erected between the cities to protect [[East Ardougne]] and in turn, all of ''[[RuneScape]]''.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Biohazard\n|image = [[File:Biohazard reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 3\n|rewards =\n*{{SCP|Thieving|1,250}} [[Thieving]] [[experience]]\n*Use of the [[Combat Training Camp]] north of the city.

Grab a [[cabbage]] from [[Edgeville Monastery]] near the [[Black Knights' Fortress (location)|Black Knights' Fortress]] or at the cabbage patch in the [[Falador farm|farm south of Falador]] (cabbage taken from [[Draynor Manor]] will not work; you will find out why during the quest), buy a [[bronze med helm]] from [[Peksa]] in [[Barbarian Village]] (or get one in the backroom of Draynor Manor), and buy an [[iron chainbody]] from [[Wayne's Chains - Chainmail Specialist|Wayne's Chains]] in [[Falador]]. If your [[Smithing]] level is high enough (3 for the bronze medium helmet, and 26 for the iron chainbody), you can just smith the chain and the helmet. If not, you'll have to buy them from the shops listed above or buy them from the [[Grand Exchange]].\n\n===Starting out===\n[[File:Sir Amik Varze chathead.png|left]]\nTalk to [[Sir Amik Varze]], who can be found on the {{FloorNumber|uk=2}} west wing of [[White Knights' Castle]] in [[Falador]]. He will tell you that he needs a spy. He wants you to spy on the [[Black Knight]]s for him at their fortress located just north of [[Ice Mountain]] near [[Edgeville]]. He wants you to find out what their new weapon is and destroy it. A free inventory space is needed for a dossier handed to you by Sir Amik Varze. Note: The dossier will self-destruct once you read it, signifying the start of the quest.\n\n===Infiltrating the fortress===\n{{Needed|An [[iron chainbody]], a [[bronze med helm]], and a [[cabbage]] not from Draynor Manor.}}\n{{Map|width=250|height=250|x=3020|y=3514|align=right|caption=The fortress is due north-east of Falador and slightly west of the Monastery.}}\nMake your way to the [[Black Knights' Fortress (location)|Black Knights' Fortress]]. It is north-east of the [[Dwarven Mine]] and the [[Oracle]], north-west of the [[Edgeville Monastery|Monastery]]. Run through the [[Black Knight]]s, as they will attack you because they are naturally [[Aggressiveness|aggressive]]. Enter the door to the south surrounded by guards. Make sure you are wearing the [[Iron chainbody]] and the [[Bronze med helm]] (you may wear armour in the legs, cape, shield, gloves, boots, and amulet slot for extra protection, but the body and head slot must be the iron chainbody and bronze med helm), or they won't let you enter.\n\n{{Checklist|\n*Once inside, the wall right in front of you can be pushed. Push it to enter a small room.\n*Climb up the ladder in this small room.\n*Climb up the ladder immediately to the right of it.\n*Climb down the ladder just south.\n*Go through a door to the east.\n*Go up the closest ladder.\n*Climb down the ladder immediately to the east beside the one you just came up and you will end up in a room with a chaos prayer altar.\n*Open the sturdy door and run to avoid the knights.\n*Climb down the ladder to the south-west, and you will find yourself in a small L-shaped room.\n}}\n\nIn this small room, there will be a grill. Click on it to listen. You will hear a conversation between the [[Black Knight Captain]], a [[witch]] and a [[goblin (race)|goblin]].\n\n===Sabotaging the secret weapon===\nIf you are at low health from any previously encountered [[Black Knight]]s, you can go to the [[Edgeville Monastery|Monastery]] located East of the [[Black Knights' Fortress (location)|Black Knights' Fortress]] and speak to a [[Monk]] to heal you.\n\n\n\nReturn to the room with the false wall and try to open the door to the east (there are many [[Black Knight]]s walking around a table inside).\n\nA guard will stop you with a dialogue box saying that they are having an important meeting. Say that you will go in any way.\n\nGo in any way. Go up the Ladder on the northern wall of the room.\n\n\nWalk around the upper, L shaped landing, and Push the wall the wall open. '''Right-click''' your [[cabbage]] so that you do not eat it, and use it with the hole that should be in the room. You will hear the witch say that her weapon is destroyed. \n\nIf you just accidentally ate your cabbage, another can be found in a patch near the Edgeville Monastery. You can also kill the imps near the Mysterious Ruins to the south as they can drop them.\n[[File:Black Knights' Fortress - Cauldron.png|thumb|220px|Dropping the cabbage creates a strange reaction.]]You could use the \"talk-to\" option to freeze a guard from moving, allowing you to trap the black knight behind him. This way, you can kill him with magic easily, or likely just go through the door after having him behind a guard linearly to the door.\n\nUsing a cabbage picked from the Draynor Manor patch will result in a dialogue box saying, \"this is the wrong sort of cabbage!\" and your character will say, \"I'm not supposed to be HELPING the witch you know!\"\n\nReturn to [[Sir Amik Varze]], and tell him you sabotaged the weapon. When he is done talking, you will have finished the quest, and have received your award.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Reward==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Black Knights' Fortress\n|image = [[File:Black Knights' Fortress reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 3\n|rewards = * 2,500 [[Coins]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Black Knights' Fortress is required for the following:\n*[[King's Ransom]]\n*[[Recruitment Drive]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|daterange = 7 August 2006\n|update = Gnome Cuisine\n|change = The quest underwent a major rework, with graphical updates and changes to dialogue.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|daterange = 26 January -<br/>25 June 2005\n|update = \n|change = The quest was renamed from \"Black Knight's Fortress\" to \"Black Knights' Fortress\".\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|daterange = 29 March 2004\n|update = RS2 Launched!\n|change = The quest was renamed from \"Black knight's fortress\" to \"Black Knight's Fortress\".\n}}\n\n{{Subject changes\n|daterange = 28 May -<br/> 16 June 2001\n|update = \n|change = The quest was renamed from \"Spy quest\" to \"Black knight's fortress\".\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The quest point requirement was added to discourage players from creating new accounts to do the quest and transfer the 2,500 [[coins]] to their main characters.\n*If the player tries to throw a [[Draynor Manor]] cabbage down into the cauldron they will receive the chatbox message \"This is the wrong sort of cabbage!\", along with the character stating \"I'm not supposed to be HELPING the witch you know...\"\n*When talking to [[Sir Amik Varze]] to start the quest, he says \"Your mission, should you decide to accept it\". This is a reference to ''{{Wp|Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission Impossible}}''.\n*The dossier given to you by Sir Amik Varze reads: \"Infiltrate fortress... sabotage secret weapon... self destruct in 3...2...ARG!\", which is another reference to ''Mission Impossible''.\n*This quest was named '''Spy quest''' until the Quest List was released on [[28 May]] [[2001]].\n*At first, the quest gave around 250 [[Thieving]] experience as a reward. Thieving was in the skill menu at the time, but had not been programmed yet. The skill was later removed and added back in 2002, but the quest no longer gave Thieving experience.\n*When talking to Sir Amik Varze to start the quest, you can choose to say \"I laugh in the face of danger!\" This is most likely a reference to Simba in ''{{Wp|The Lion King}}''.\n\n\n{{Black Knights' Fortress}}"

Ask if he has any interesting news. He will tell you that they have found an interesting island north of [[Morytania]], and that they believe it may be of archaeological significance. They are in the process of making the final preparations for the voyage, and he has recommended you talk to the [[barge foreman]], who has requested the aid of a qualified and experienced adventurer. Agree to help, and make your way to the [[Digsite]].\n\n===The finishing touches===\nHead to the [[canal barge]] north of the [[Digsite]]. There, speak to the [[barge foreman]] in front of the barge. They are in the final stages of preparation, but there are a few minor adjustments he'd like to make to the barge before getting the crew ready. He requires a sturdier type of wood to keep the barge afloat; [[magic logs]] will not do, since they had peculiar side effects (which you will learn later). He will require a high-grade wood found only in the [[Great Kourend|distant Western lands]] - redwood.\n\nThe barge foreman will instruct the player to talk to the [[Sawmill operator]] at the [[Sawmill]] north-west from the barge.\n\nTravel to the [[Lumber Yard]] and speak to the Sawmill operator. In order to obtain redwood planks, he has arranged a fairly generous deal between himself and the sawmill in [[Great Kourend]]'s [[Woodcutting Guild]]. He will give you a [[sawmill proposal]], which you will have to deliver to the Woodcutting Guild.\n\nNow, travel to the Woodcutting Guild in [[Hosidius]] using your skills necklace, or [[Xeric's talisman|Xeric's Talisman - Xeric's Lookout]] which is fairly close. Ironmen may want to use the [[Tithe Farm|Tithe farm]] [[minigame teleport]] instead (Must have entered farmer Gricollers' guild before. Otherwise travel from Veos in Port Sarim, or use [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|AKR}}), and hand the proposal to the Woodcutting Guild Sawmill operator. If you don't have the requirements to enter the Woodcutting Guild, try to open the eastern gate to the guild to complete this step; [[Berry (Woodcutting Guild)|Berry]] will sign it on behalf of the guild's sawmill operator.\n\nReturn to the [[Varrock]] Sawmill operator, and give him the [[sawmill agreement]].\n\n===The cursed voyage===\n[[File:Bone Voyage.png|thumb|250px|The completed barge.]]\nGo back to the [[barge foreman]], who will ask you to board the [[Canal barge|barge]]. Speak to the [[barge guard]], and he will let you board the barge. On the barge, speak to the [[Lead Navigator]]. First, confirm that you are here to help them out. Then he will ask you if you are aware of the previous attempts at the expedition. Pick the first option if you wish to know what happened. Otherwise, pick the second to skip the dialogue.\n\n*The first barge had some serious design flaws... it didn't float.\n*The second barge suffered from 'feature creep'. Senior museum staff stuck their oar in and added unnecessary features: 'go-faster stripes', a portable fossil centrifuge and a walk-on mini-museum. Needless to say, it had... buoyancy issues.\n*The third barge made it out to sea, but a special sealant was used that attracted sea monsters. They didn't make it very far.\n*The fourth also used a special sealant, this one attracted icebergs.\n*The fifth barge crashed into the sixth.\n*We lost the seventh one.\n*The eighth barge is still here, we think. An accident involving a magical explosion and some talking [[anchovies]] means that it is now believed to reside 12 seconds out of phase.\n*The ninth version was built with [[magic logs]]. The barge gained some form of rudimentary sentience. It developed serious depression and ran itself aground near [[Crandor]].\n\nThus, he will believe the voyage is cursed, and will refuse to sail unless you can ensure the safety of the crew from this curse. He asks you to talk to some experienced sailors in the [[Rusty Anchor Inn]] in [[Port Sarim]].\n\nTeleport and go to the Rusty Anchor Inn in [[Port Sarim]] using an [[amulet of glory|Amulet of Glory (Draynor)]], Rimmington [[Teleport to House|house teleport]], or the [[Rat Pits]] [[Minigame teleport]]. Talk to [[Jack Seagull]] in the Rusty Anchor Inn, and ask him if he has ever made any cursed voyages. He will claim that you need a lucky [[bone charm]], and that you should speak to the [[Odd Old Man]] in [[Silvarea]] to get one. [[Ahab]] will interrupt, claiming that a '[[potion of sealegs]]' will have you sail the voyage unscathed. You decide that you'll ask the navigators which one they'll prefer to have.\n\nReturn to the Lead Navigator. He will want the potion of sealegs, but the [[Junior Navigator]] wants the bone charm instead.\n\nVisit the Odd Old Man (the rag and bone man) by the [[Silvarea mine]], north of the [[Digsite]], and ask for a lucky charm. Tell him that you're making a cursed voyage to receive the bone charm.\n\nSpeak to the [[Apothecary]] in [[Varrock]] south-west of Varrock Square (you will need to select \"Talk about something else\"). He will require a [[marrentill potion (unf)]] and two bottles of [[vodka]]. Speak to him again to receive the potion of sealegs.\n\n===The \"cursed\" voyage===\n[[File:Bone Voyage - sailing the ocean blue.png|thumb|250x250px|Sailing the treacherous waters to Fossil Island.]]\nReturn to the [[barge]], and give the [[Junior Navigator]] the [[bone charm]] and the [[Lead Navigator]] the [[potion of sealegs]].\n\n[[File:Barge controls.png|left|thumb|The barge controls.]]\nUnsurprisingly, the potion has made everyone except the Junior Navigator pass out. As he has never navigated open waters, you will now have to steer the barge. You will have to steer the rudder left, right, or straight using the controls on the interface. The progress bar will indicate how far you have to go to reach the island; going too far off course will reduce your progress. If it takes too long, the boat will get lost and the crew will wake up; simply talk to the Junior Navigator to start again.\n\nTips to get there quickly:\n\n*When the top arrow tilts to the left, click on the right arrow a couple of times to tilt the rudder.\n*When the top arrow tilts to the right, click on the left arrow a couple of times to tilt the rudder.\n*When the top arrow is mostly straight ahead, click on the arrows to centre the rudder.\n*Changing the height of the sails will alter how drastically the boat shifts from side to side. Having the boat's sails as large as possible when going in a straight line will allow for faster travel. It's possible to successfully navigate to the island by leaving the sails fully deployed the whole time.\n\nOnce the progress bar is filled, you will arrive at [[Fossil Island]].\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Bone Voyage|image=[[File:Bone Voyage reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=1|rewards=*Access to [[Fossil Island]] - to disembark the boat upon arrival at Fossil Island, speak to the [[Junior Navigator]].}}\n*[[Fossil island note book]]\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Bone Voyage is required for the following:\n*[[Dragon Slayer II]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Fossil Island login screen.png|thumb|300px|The log in screen upon the release of the Bone Voyage and Fossil Island.]]\n*A log in screen competition was held around 2 weeks before release in order to use a player-made log in screen to commemorate release of the quest. The winner of the competition, ''Runezilla'', was awarded with \"1 Year of Membership\".\n*The name of the quest is a pun on the French ''bon voyage'', used to wish others a safe journey, and ''bones'', since the destination is [[Fossil Island]]. The pun made its first appearance in an [[Update:Rag and Bone Man|update newspost]] on [[10 April]] [[2006]] with the release of [[Rag and Bone Man I]].\n*The term \"{{wp|feature creep}}\" used to describe the second flawed design refers to a common anti-pattern in software design, where unnecessary features are added to the system. In real life this often results in the failure of the system.\n*The problem with the ninth barge may be a reference to the Liveship novels by Robin Hobb. The novels feature a moody, sentient ship made from magical wood that runs itself aground several times.\n*The problem with the eighth barge may be a reference to the science-fiction series Star Trek. In the series, phase shifting is a ship-cloaking technology commonly used by the Romulan Star Empire.\n*There is a spelling error is the dialogue with the Lead Navigator when he mentions the eighth barge - he spells it the 'eigth' barge.\n\n{{Bone Voyage}}"

Bill is the captain of ''The Adventurous'', a ship which he claims is the finest ever to sail the seas. He needs a pirate to help him leave the port, but none will sail with him, not even his crew.\n\nLast night, he had a heated argument with the captain of another ship, wherein the captain threatened to sink ''The Adventurous'' and put his crew \"to the sword\". Scared, all his crewmembers have abandoned him and he has no choice but to sail back to his home land.\n\nSeeing his dilemma and wanting to be a pirate, you offer to help him. Although he doubts your plundering abilities, Bill accepts your help and tells you to meet him on his ship. Go to the Port Phasmatys docks, and board the easternmost ship, ''The Adventurous''. Speak with Bill to set sail for [[Mos Le'Harmless]] and begin your journey as a pirate.\n\n===Under attack!===\n[[File:Cabin Fever - Enemy ship attacks.png|thumb|220px|''The Adventurous'' is attacked by an enemy ship.]]\nAs soon as you leave port, you see a [[cutscene]], where an enemy pirate ship starts firing on ''The Adventurous'', destroying the ship's hull and cannon. [[Bill Teach|Bill]] calms you down and tells you to first take care of the enemy's cannon.\n\n[[File:Cabin Fever - gunpowder explosion.png|left|thumb|Detonating the gunpowder barrel.]]\nHe suggests you grab some [[Fuse (Cabin Fever)|fuse]] and [[rope]] from the ship's bottom deck. Climb down to the bottom deck and search the ''repair locker'', to take out '''four''' ropes (you will need to cross to the enemy ship a second time later, and each trip requires two ropes). Search the ''gun locker'' located near the repair locker, and pick up a fuse. In the southern corner, there is also a [[tinderbox]]; grab it.\n\n[[File:Cabin Fever - On the enemy ship.png|thumb|220px|A player is attacked by a [[pirate]] on the enemy ship.]]\nClimb up the ship's ladder to the main deck, and use the climbing net to climb up the main mast. Use your rope on the hoisted sail of ''The Adventurous'' to swing over to the enemy ship. If you fail the jump, your [[run energy]] will drop to 0.\n\nThe ship is populated by level 57 [[pirate]]s. If you need to escape from them for a moment, climb up the net on the main mast. For your job, find the powder barrel next to the cannon on the west side of the deck and use the fuse on the powder barrel. Light the fuse to blow up the barrel and the cannon. Climb back on the main mast using the net, and using a rope, swing back over to ''The Adventurous'' - '''if you forgot to bring a second rope, you can find one in the south-western corner of the main deck of the enemy pirate's ship.'''\n\n====Repairing the Damage====\n[[File:Cabin Fever - Repairing hull.png|thumb|220px|Repairing the ship's hull.]]\nNow that you've controlled the offence, you need to build your defence.

When you have enough resources, a message in the chat interface will say so, if you try to get more than is needed.\n\nFor each hole, use a repair plank and then a swamp paste on the ship hull to patch it up.\n\nThen, go talk to Bill again.\n\n====Retaliation!====\nFor attacking your ship, the enemy [[pirate]]s need to be taught a lesson. [[Bill Teach|Bill]] asks you to pillage the enemy ship and bring back their booty. Return to the main deck, climb the net again, use a [[rope]] on the hoisted sail, and swing back over to the enemy ship.\n\nClimb down the ship's ladder. Steal from the chest, loot the crate and ransack the barrel for enemy [[plunder]]; you will need to wait for it to respawn. You need 10 plunder, but looting all three once only provides you with 6 plunder, 3 being from the chest, 2 from the crate and 1 from the barrel. It can take anywhere up to 5 minutes for the plunder to respawn; however, you can simply log out and log back in (or switch worlds) for the plunder to respawn. The barrel will respawn fastest, then the crates and finally, the chest.\n\nAfter you have ten plunder in your [[inventory]], return to the main deck, and return to ''The Adventurous''.\n\nClimb down the ship's ladder, and use your plunder on the plunder storage at the back. If you leave the ship, you will lose the plunder and have to steal it back over again. Also, you can only store ten plunder; Bill will confiscate any surplus in your inventory when you talk to him.\n\n====Into Davy Jones' Locker====\n[[File:Cabin Fever - Using ship cannon.png|thumb|220px|Using the ship's cannon to retaliate.]]\nFinally, [[Bill Teach|Bill]] wants you to prepare a send-off for the enemy. He wants to give the enemy [[pirate]]s a blast, from the [[Cannon (Cabin Fever)|cannon]]. The aim here is to prepare the cannon (follow steps below) and to fire the cannon when the pirates are in front of the cannon on the pirate ship, so that you will hit them. Follow these steps to repair and fire the cannon:\n\nClimb down the ship's ladder, search the gun locker, and take a [[cannon barrel (Cabin Fever)|cannon barrel]]. Trying to take anything else at this point will result in the message \"You do not need a [item name] right now.\" Climb back up and left-click the [[Cannon (Cabin Fever)#Exploded|broken cannon]] to fix it (The cannon will have the option \"Repair broken cannon\").\n\nTalk to Bill again, then go below and search the gun locker for a [[ramrod]], a few [[fuse]]s (at least 4 is recommended here), and a [[canister|cannon canister]]. Return to the main deck, and choose the take-powder option from the powder barrel next to the cannon.\n\n[[Gunpowder]] can be obtained from the powder barrel located right next to the cannon, just left click the 'take powder' option.\n#Use gunpowder on the cannon.\n#Use the ramrod on the cannon.\n#Use a canister on the cannon.\n#Use a fuse on the cannon.\n#Fire the cannon!\n#Use the ramrod on the cannon again to clean it out.\n\nIf you miss, use the ramrod on the cannon to clean it out and then repeat the steps, until you score a hit. If you don't clean the cannon, it will explode from the previous unused gunpowder. If this happens, replace the broken barrel with a new one from the gun locker. Try not to fire the cannon immediately after attaching the fuse. This can cause multiple misses. Count to 3 before firing.\n\nWhen you hit the pirates with the canisters, talk to Bill. He tells you to sink the enemy pirate ship by blasting holes in its hull; three would be enough. Go down below, and search the gun locker to take three [[cannon ball (Cabin Fever)|cannon ball]]s (best to take extra cannon balls and fuses because you can miss). \n\nUp on the main deck, complete the following:\n\n#Clean the cannon out with a ramrod.\n#Use gunpowder on the cannon.\n#Use the ramrod on the cannon to compact the gunpowder.\n#This time, use a CANNONBALL (INSTEAD of a canister) on the cannon.\n#Use a fuse on the cannon.\n#Fire the cannon!\n\n\n\n'''Note:''' \n\nClean the cannon immediately after firing every time. '''Selecting \"Empty-Out Cannon\" does not clean the cannon''' in spite of the chat message that reads, \"You clean out the cannon,\" upon doing so. You will take some damage (around 6) and destroy the cannon (having to repair it again) each time you fail to complete:\n\n• Step 1: cleaning the cannon after firing and before loading gunpowder, OR \n\n• Step 3: using the ramrod after loading with gunpowder and before loading a canister OR cannonball. ***\n\n\n\nUpon hitting the enemy ship THREE (3) times, a short cutscene will follow.\n\n===Mos Le'Harmless===\n[[File:Cabin Fever - Le'Fiette & Teach.png|thumb|220px|[[Mama]] and [[Bill Teach|Bill]] chat.]]\nFollowing your third hit of the enemy pirate ship, you see a [[cutscene]] with [[Bill Teach]] talking with [[Mama|Mama Le'Fiette]] in [[The Other Inn]]. Bill then thanks you and gives you a [[Book o' piracy]], to add \"pirate\" to your vocabulary as your ineptitude at speaking \"pirate\" annoyed him to no end in the voyage.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Cabin Fever\n|image = [[File:Cabin Fever reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Crafting|7,000}} [[Crafting]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Smithing|7,000}} [[Smithing]] experience\n*{{SCP|Agility|7,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*10,000 [[coins]] (only if you speak to [[Bill Teach]] after the quest)\n*Access to [[Mos Le'Harmless]]\n*Access to kill [[cave horror]]s\n*The [[Book o' piracy]]\n*[[Charter ship]] prices are halved\n*Ability to play the [[Trouble Brewing]] minigame\n}}\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Cabin Fever is required for the following:\n*[[The Great Brain Robbery]]\n*Medium tier of the [[Morytania Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*If your canister shot kills a rat on the enemy ship, it will still count as if you had killed a pirate.\n*You can actually see the holes you put in the enemy ship's hull from the Adventurous.

Alina will tell you that a delegation from the Kingdom of [[Varlamore]] is on their way to Varrock after a long period of isolation. You may ask her various information about the kingdom, or ask when the delegation will arrive to immediately progress through the quest, which will begin a cutscene.\n\nThe delegation, seen approaching [[King Roald]] and [[Aeonisig Raispher]], comprises of [[Prince Itzla Arkan]], [[Servius, Teokan of Ralos]], [[Furia Tullus]], [[Ennius Tullus]], and six [[Knight of Varlamore (Children of the Sun)|Knights of Varlamore]]. Meanwhile, a guard carrying a large bag is seen leaving the walls of the [[Varrock Palace]]. Though his superior, [[Sergeant Tobyn]], lets him leave, you believe he looks a bit suspicious and decide to tail him.\n\n===Investigation===\n[[File:Children of the Sun - suspicious guard path.png|frame|The path you can take, and where to stand on to prevent being spotted.]]\n[[File:Children of the Sun - the bandits scheme.png|thumb|280px|Eavesdropping on the bandit's scheme.]]\nThe guard will walk towards south-east Varrock and periodically turn around, where you will need to hide behind a building in order to avoid his sight. If you are caught, you will have to talk to Noah and start from the beginning again.\n\nUse the image on the right and '''walk''' accordingly, standing on the indicated spots and resume walking once he's on the move again:\n* Run inside [[Lowe's Archery Emporium]]. \n* Hide behind the northern wall of the building south of the archery shop.\n* Walk to the south-eastern corner of the building.\n* Hide behind the western wall of [[Old Man Yarlo]]'s house.\n* Hide either inside Old Man Yarlo's house or near the building south of [[Aubury's Rune Shop]].\n\nAfter hiding in the last spot, the suspicious guard will enter the small building just next to [[Aubury's Rune Shop]] and a cutscene will automatically begin, detailing how the guard was actually a member of some [[Bandit (Children of the Sun)|bandits]], and how they plan to attack the delegation as they leave.\n\nAfter the cutscene, go back to Varrock Square and speak to [[Sergeant Tobyn]]. He will instruct the player to identify the four bandits posing as guards. Do so by clicking the \"Mark\" option on them:\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nChildren of the Sun guard location (1).png|The first guard can be found directly outside [[Aris]]'s tent.

You will be taken to the cell on the palace roof to assist with the interrogations. Unexpectedly, [[Prince Itzla]] will appear; having been bored by the politics and hearing a bit of commotion, he decides to come to the roof. He will introduce himself to you and decide to assist you with the interrogations.\n\nA cutscene will play where Prince Itzla interrogates one of the bandits, with you providing a little help. The bandit quickly gives in and informs him that they were approached by someone unknown, possibly from Varlamore, to kill [[Servius, Teokan of Ralos]].\n\nAfter the interrogation, Prince Itzla will thank you for your role in stopping the assassination attempt by giving you special permission to visit [[Varlamore]] and asks you to speak with [[Regulus Cento]] outside the Eastern gate of Varrock when you're ready to travel to Varlamore and help continue the investigation on the assassination attempt.\n\nSpeak to [[Sergeant Tobyn]] in the cell room.\n\n'''Quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Children of the Sun\n|image = [[File:Children of the Sun reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n* Access to [[Varlamore]] through the [[Quetzal Transport System]] and [[fairy rings]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nThe completion of Children of the Sun is a requirement to complete the following:\n\n* [[Twilight's Promise]]\n* [[At First Light]]\n* [[The Ribbiting Tale of a Lily Pad Labour Dispute]]\n* [[Death on the Isle]]\n* [[Meat and Greet]]\n* [[Ethically Acquired Antiquities]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Unlock details \n! class=\"unsortable\" |Music track\n|-\n|[[Children of the Sun (music track)|Children of the Sun]] \n|Unlocked upon the arrival of the Varlamorian delegation.\n|[[File:Children of the Sun.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Plots and Plans]] \n|Unlocked upon following the suspicious Varrock guard.\n|[[File:Plots and Plans.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[The Burning Sun]] \n|Unlocked upon interrogating the bandit.\n|[[File:The Burning Sun.ogg]]\n|}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 17 January 2024\n|update = Scythe & Fang Updates\n|change = Some dialogue with [[Sergeant Tobyn]] has been updated to provide clarity on what to do next.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* When starting the quest, the player states \"Well I'm actually something of an adventurer myself.\" This is a reference to the 2002 film ''{{WP|Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man}}'' (and subsequent internet meme), where Norman Osborn introduces himself to Peter Parker with the line \"You know, I'm something of a scientist myself.\"\n* The Sergeant mentions that Varrock goes through guards very quickly, likely a reference to the large amounts of guards killed by players for combat training. A similar joke is made in [[Garden of Tranquillity]].\n* When Alina mentions a group from the [[College of Bards]] on their way to Morytania, she is likely referring to [[Hameln the Jester]] and his companions, [[Hanchen the Hound]] and the [[Painted One]], who can be found in [[Slepe]].\n* The armour worn by the Knights of Varlamore is a reference to the character Solaire of Astora from the ''{{WP|Dark Souls}}'' video game series.\n* When [[Sergeant Tobyn]] hears from the bandits' plans, he says \"Surely you can't be serious?\", which is a reference to the 1980 movie {{WP|Airplane!}}.

He will say that he has a client from the mainland who is interested in some knowledge surrounding the cities of [[Kourend]], specifically its hierarchy and general social organisation. Agree to help him, and he will give you an [[enchanted scroll]], '''which you must use a [[feather]] on to create an [[enchanted quill]]'''. If you haven't got one already, a feather can be easily obtained from [[Gerrant's Fishy Business]] in [[Port Sarim]]. \n\nWith the [[enchanted quill]] and [[enchanted scroll]] from Veos in your inventory, you will have to speak to the general store owners of Great Kourend. They can be found in buildings marked with the [[File:General store icon.png]] icon.\n\n'''Note:''' If you are using [[Xeric's talisman]] to get around [[Great Kourend]], talk to [[Leenz]] at her [[Leenz's General Supplies|general store]], north of [[Veos]] before teleporting, as this is the one city where teleporting doesn't shorten the running distance. After that, teleport to the appropriate destination and travel to the next general store, repeating the process as needed.\n\n'''Note:''' After the Zeah Favour removal, the [[Lovakengj Minecart Network]] are automatically unlocked for 20 coins a ride, and can significantly speed up the quest compared to simply running. Consider riding from Munty to Jennifer, Jennifer to Horace, and to and from the Dark Altar.\n\n[[File:Enchanted Quill Damage.gif|thumb|upright|right|A player taking damage from the enchanted quill.]]\n\nSpeak to a store owner, and ask them about their respective city and what there is to do in their respective city. When you are receiving information from the [[Regath]], the [[Arceuus]] general store owner, the quill will mysteriously glow and damage your hand! You will not take any damage, however.\n\nOnce you've spoken to every single general store owner, a mysterious voice whispers to you that you must return to [[Veos]]. He will take your quill and scroll. You then tell [[Veos]] about your hand being damaged, and he says the client apologises, as the mention of the [[Dark Altar]] \"provoked emotions\".\n[[File:Activate the Mysterious orb near the Dark Altar.png|thumb|left|220px|Activating the orb near the Dark Altar.]]\n[[Veos]] will then ask you to take a [[Mysterious orb (Client of Kourend)|mysterious orb]] and activate it when near the [[Dark Altar]]. The Dark Altar is found north of [[Arceuus]], which can be reached relatively quickly by teleporting to the [[Wintertodt Camp]] via a [[games necklace]], running south until you reach the dark area, and then east. The dark altar is at the end of the purple crystals. If you have access to [[Fairy rings]], use the code {{Fairycode|CIS}} to get there (the Dark Altar is just north-east of the fairy ring).\n[[File:Client possessing Veos.gif|thumb|upright|right|Veos becomes possessed by his client.]]\nOnce you are near the [[Dark Altar]], activate the orb. It will shatter into [[broken glass]]. The mysterious voice will then whisper to you that you must return to [[Veos]] once more.\n\nReturn to [[Veos]] in [[Port Piscarilius]]; the quest cannot be completed by talking to him in [[Port Sarim]]. He will then claim that he has not spoken to you since taking you to [[Great Kourend]], and suddenly becomes possessed. [[Veos' Client]] will now speak, with the player questioning him to no avail.

The bones will remind him of Copper, his pet wolf - a loyal, brave and gentle wolf who wore a crimson collar. When Veos was travelling in the [[Fremennik Province]]s, he and his wolf (who was 19 years old) were ambushed by a group of feral foxes, and suffered fatal wounds. Veos ran away, and he sought to search for his remains, to no avail. Offer to help him, then travel to the Fremennik Province.\n\n[[Fox]]es can be found either east of the [[Hosidius Kitchen]], or north of the [[Sinclair Mansion]], across the river.

However, the client foiled the attempt, asking the player if they truly thought that he could be manipulated by \"Charos' feeble magic\".

You should see four spindles near the ladder; use the black cog with the black spindle.\n\n===Obtaining the red cog===\n'''''Optional items:''' [[Food]] and [[armour]].''\n[[File:Clock Tower - Red cog.png|thumb|220px|The location of the [[red cog]].]]\nHead through the south-eastern door, indicated by the red tile and walk down the passageway until you see some [[Ogre]]s.\n\nThe [[red cog]] will be on the floor where the Ogres are. Run over and pick it up then return to the ladder where you came from. \n\nClimb up to the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} and use the red cog on the red spindle. The spindles are located on a column beside the ground-floor ladder.\n\n===Obtaining the white cog===\n[[File:Clock Tower - White cog.png|thumb|220px|The location of the [[white cog]].]]\nReturn to the tile room and head through the north-western door, indicated by the white tile and follow the outer passageway until you find some [[rat poison]] ''(consider taking an extra for [[Ratcatchers]], or you can make one when you need it with [[kwuarm]] and [[red spiders' eggs]])''.\n\nPick up the poison, then go north-east down the long passageway until you see two levers near the [[dungeon rat]]s. Pull the levers up to open the rat cage. Then head through the two gates and use the poison that you picked up before with the food trough.\n\nThe dungeon rats will eat the poisoned food and begin to die. Wait until they've all died, and then you'll find that the gate to the west has become unhinged. Head through the western gate until you find the [[white cog]]. Pick it up and use the ladder nearby to appear outside of the Clock Tower. \n\nGo inside and climb to the topmost floor. Now, use the white cog with the white spindle on the top floor.\n\n===Finishing up===\nOnce you've placed all of the cogs on their corresponding spindles, head back to [[Brother Kojo]], and he will reward you.\n\n'''Note:''' To keep duplicates of the cogs, after putting the cogs on the clock spindles, but before completing the quest, reobtain each cog in the same way as before. Once the quest is completed, cogs can '''not''' be picked up from the spawn or if the duplicate is dropped.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Clock Tower\n|image = [[File:Clock Tower reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*500 [[coins]]\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Prior to an [[Update:Secrets of the North & More!|update]] on [[11 January]] [[2023]], the quest could be marginally sped up by using the [[Key (Ernest the Chicken)|key]] obtained during [[Ernest the Chicken]], since it allowed players to walk through the [[boarded-up door]] in the south-eastern corner of the [[Clock Tower (building)|Clock Tower building]]. When returning the [[blue cog]], entering through this boarded-up door used to be slightly faster than entering through the main entrance.\n*When poisoning the [[dungeon rat]]s, all of the rats will keel over and die, even if they were trapped by the open cell door and were not able to get to the [[Food trough (Clock Tower)|food trough.]]\n\n{{Clock Tower}}"

He's a bit nutty about [[penguin]]s. Larry hopes to build a lookout to observe the penguins. His instructions are to collect him 10 [[oak plank]]s, 10 [[steel nails]], a [[hammer]] and a [[spade]]. When you have your supplies, talk to him again and tell him that you have the materials to build the lookout (He also says to meet him north-east of [[Rellekka]], but this is not necessary). He will now teleport you to the [[Iceberg]]. Accept the teleportation prompt (you can't have any pet following you, otherwise you won't be teleported).\n\n''If you opt out of Larry's offer or ever need to get to the meeting location without his teleport, you have to go to the north-east of the rock crabs, and can teleport very close to it with the [[fairy ring]] code {{fairycode|dks}} (just walk down the mountain and a small bit north-west to the dock). If you have completed [[The Giant Dwarf]], you can use the [[Grand Exchange]] trapdoor to shortcut to Rellekka. You can also use the [[enchanted lyre]] to teleport to Rellekka and walk to the meeting spot. If no closer teleport is available to you, teleport to [[Camelot]] and walk north. '''If you leave an area during any point in the quest, Larry will not teleport you back and you'll need to make your way there yourself. Prepare for this if necessary.'''''\n\nUpon arrival, you'll see a firm snow patch next to the landing spot. Build the lookout here by using an oak plank on the patch. Then, use a [[spade]] on the lookout to cover it in snow. You can also use the dig option on the spade while standing near the lookout.\n\n[[File:Cold War - Spying on penguins.png|thumb|220px|Spying on the penguins.]]\n\nWhen the lookout is ready, speak to Larry. This will be followed by a rather strange [[cutscene]]. '''Keep note of the emotes the penguin does, as the emote greeting code is unique for every player and will need to be used, in order, for several later parts of the quest.''' There are eight different [[Emotes#Penguin emotes|penguin emotes]] in all, similar to the normal character [[emotes]], and the greeting will consist of three of those. If you need to see them again, click \"Use Snowy bird hide\" to watch the cutscene again. After the cutscene, speak to Larry and suggest to him that the behaviour of the penguins in the cutscene was suspicious.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable lighttable align-center-2 align-center-3\"\n!Emote\n!Image\n!Animation\n|-\n|Shiver\n|[[File:Shiver (Penguin) emote icon.png]]\n|[[File:Shiver.gif|70x70px]]\n|-\n|Cheer\n|[[File:Cheer (Penguin) emote icon.png]]\n|[[File:Penguin cheer.gif|70x70px]]\n|-\n|Spin\n|[[File:Spin (Penguin) emote icon.png]]\n|[[File:Penguin spin.gif|70x70px]]\n|-\n|Wave\n|[[File:Wave (Penguin) emote icon.png]]\n|[[File:Penguin wave.gif|70x70px]]\n|-\n|Clap\n|[[File:Clap (Penguin) emote icon.png]]\n|[[File:Penguin clap.gif|70x70px]]\n|-\n|Preen\n|[[File:Preen emote icon.png]]\n|[[File:Preen.gif|70x70px]]\n|-\n|Bow\n|[[File:Bow (Penguin) emote icon.png]]\n|[[File:Penguin Bow.gif|70x70px]]\n|-\n|Flap\n|[[File:Flap (Penguin) emote icon.png]]\n|[[File:Penguin flap.gif|70x70px]]\n|}\n\nUse the boat or the 'travel' option on Larry to return to the dock and speak to Larry again - now, here's where things get strange. Larry requests to now design a [[clockwork suit]], which will be used to spy on the penguins. He gives a [[Clockwork book|book]] filled with instructions.\n\n===The clockwork suit===\n{{Needed|A plank, a piece of silk, and a [[clockwork]] or a steel bar to make one (access to a [[crafting table 3]] or better is also required. It must either be built by the player in their own [[Player-owned house|player-owned house]] (also requiring the prerequisites to do so, those being having a [[workshop]] and [[crafting table 2]] to upgrade) or one must be accessed in another player's house).}}\n\nCollect a regular wood [[plank]] (the [[games necklace]] teleport is handy here; just teleport to the [[Barbarian Outpost]] and head east a bit to find some planks. Or, go just south-east of the zoo to pick one up at [[Port Khazard]]), a piece of [[silk]] (steal one at the [[Ardougne Market|East Ardougne market place]] if you have level 20+ Thieving) and a [[clockwork]] (or a [[steel bar]] if you're making one).\n\nIf making one, use the clockmaker's bench ([[crafting table 3]]) at your [[Player-owned house|house]] (or someone else's) to make a [[Clockwork|clockwork mechanism]] with the steel bar in your [[inventory]]. Then, use the clockmaker's bench again and select \"clockwork toy\" followed by \"clockwork penguin\" to make the [[clockwork suit]] with the plank, the piece of silk, and the clockwork mechanism in your inventory.\n\n===Back to the Iceberg===\n{{Needed|recommended=To avoid unnecessary banking, bring a [[Dramen]] or [[Lunar]] staff and teleport runes to access the [[Fairy ring network]] (Alternative: Varrock/[[GE]] teleport runes to take the Kelda mine cart back to Larry), a [[raw cod]] or [[ring of charos (a)]], and multiple teleportations to Lumbridge.}}\n\nReturn to [[Larry]] after finishing the [[Clockwork suit|suit]] (in the north-east of [[Rellekka]] or at the [[Ardougne Zoo]]) Then, return to the [[Iceberg]] with him to test it out.\n\nAfter returning, you come to find out that the lookout has been completely destroyed and that all the penguins are missing. Speak to Larry, and to no surprise, he will blame the penguins. Now, since there are no penguins, it appears impossible to test the suit. However, being the clever adventurer, you will suggest that the suit be tested on the penguins at the zoo. Larry will kindly assist with a teleport back to the [[Ardougne Zoo]], should you accept.\n\n===Meet the penguins===\n{{Needed|[[Raw cod]] or [[ring of charos (a)]].|recommended=Teleportation methods to Lumbridge.}}\n[[File:Cold War - Disguised as penguin.png|thumb|220px|The player, disguised as a penguin.]]\n\nFree your hand and cape slots and talk to [[Larry]]. He will then cast a magic spell. The magic causes a player to shrink and enter the [[Clockwork suit|penguin suit]]! Now, test out the disguise. Head into the penguin enclosure and right click on the penguins until you find one with the talk option. Talk to that [[Penguin (Cold War)|penguin]], and you will be forced to give him a greeting before he shall speak to you; this is different for each player. Use the emote sequence that the earlier [[cutscene]] showed. If you do not know the sequence it is too late to go back and find out, but fortunately you can guess the emotes and will be told as soon as you make a mistake. This means a maximum of 24 guesses are needed, not 512! The penguin will start talking once you're successful, and will reveal that they're trying to learn how to fly in order to escape from the [[Ardougne Zoo]]. The penguin will give you a [[Mission report (Ardougne)|mission report]] to return to the ''outpost'' and ask you to speak to the penguins in [[Lumbridge]]. Note that the mission report received will be different depending on whether the player completed the quests [[Between a Rock...]] and/or [[Enlightened Journey]]. At this point, this will determine whether two [[Crazy penguin]] NPCs will appear in the game or not and '''the outcome will be permanent, even if the related quests are later completed'''.\n\n\nLeave the cage and speak with Larry. You will discuss where penguins could be in [[Lumbridge]]. Now, head to [[Lumbridge]].\n\nIn Lumbridge, head to [[Fred the Farmer]]'s sheep pasture where you will find Larry; use the tuxedo time option with him (don't forget to remove everything from your hand and cape slots). Now, head off and find a \"sheep\" with flippers and a talk option (if you've done the quest [[Sheep Shearer]], you may remember this \"sheep\" as the \"Thing\"). Talk to the \"sheep\" and perform the secret greeting (which remains the same as the previous step). The penguins in the sheep disguise will tell you to go away, demanding a secret phrase in addition to the secret greeting.\n\nSpeak to Larry, and he will help you both return to the [[Ardougne Zoo]]. When you have either the raw cod in your [[inventory]] or are wearing a [[ring of charos (a)]], re-tuxedo and enter the penguin enclosure once more and speak to the penguin again. If you are not wearing the ring, he will not give you the phrase, requesting a [[raw cod]] in exchange for it, the penguins' favourite food. If you are wearing the ring, he will simply provide it in the conversation, telling you that the secret phrase is ''do not trust the walrus''.\n\n===Intelligence===\n{{Needed|[[Swamp tar]], five white [[feather]]s, (both can be obtained during this part, but the [[Swamp tar]] is some distance away), and the Mission Report.}}\n\nMake your way to [[Lumbridge]] (Larry does not provide a teleport this time). If you don't have swamp tar yet, head south to the [[Lumbridge Swamp]] and pick some up. Then, head north to the farm again. If you need feathers, kill enough chickens to obtain five of them. If you can, grab the items  (''[[food]]'' ''if low combat level level or at the minimum agility requirement for the quest, [[Mahogany plank]], [[Leather]],  and a [[cowbells|cowbell]])''  for the next steps as a bank will be far away. Go to [[Fred the Farmer]]'s sheep pen and penguin suit up! Talk to the \"sheep\" again. Now, the penguins will tell you to talk to Fred the Farmer to see if he's an undercover agent for the humans.\n\n[[File:Cold War - Bullying Fred.png|thumb|220px|Bullying [[Fred the Farmer|Fred]] in order to obtain the information from the disguised penguins.]]\n\nExit your penguin suit and speak to Fred the Farmer about penguins. Use either the bully option or warn option. Both work. When you are done talking to Fred, return and speak with the penguin again. Pick either option in the conversation with the penguin and then they will give you the location of the outpost - it is on the [[Iceberg]] you visited earlier under what appears to be an avalanche. They will also give you a password: ''cabbage''.\n\n'''It is advised you steal a cowbell now from a nearby dairy cow before proceeding to next section of the quest (one can be stolen to the north or east of the sheep pen).'''\n\n'''It is also recommended to obtain the last remaining items for this quest now in order to save time later on (those items being a [[mahogany plank]] and [[leather]]. Optionally, [[Combat equipment]] and [[food]] if you have a low combat or agility  level).'''\n\nSpeak to [[Larry]], and he will teleport you to the Iceberg. Suit up to penguin again and head north-west until you see a [[KGP Agent]] penguin. Talk to him and use the emote greeting; then, tell him the password, and then he will ask you for an ID but, guess what, you don't have one!\n\nNow, speak to [[Noodle]]. He's the black market merchant close to the KGP agent, and he'll trade you an ID and a report if you give him one swamp tar and five feathers.\n\n[[File:Cold War - Debriefing.png|thumb|220px|Being debriefed by the [[KGP Agent]].]]\n\nExchange the materials with Noodle for the [[Kgp id card|ID]] and another mission report. Speak to the KGP agent and he'll let you through; then, left click on the avalanche and you should see the option ''use avalanche'' and you will enter the outpost.\n\n:'''Note:''' Whenever you wish to leave the outpost, simply removing the penguin suit will have you teleported back to Larry.\n\nOnce inside, go into the first room on the left (West), and talk to the KGP agent to be debriefed there; once done, head into the corridor on the other side of the room; you will now have to complete an [[Penguin agility course|agility course]].\n\n[[File:Cold War - Penguin army.png|thumb|220px|The penguin army!]]\n\nOnce you have exited the door at the end of the corridor, you shall see a small [[cutscene]] showing a penguin army! Suddenly, you realise their intentions are a little more devious than just flying! Follow the signs with arrows to the agility course, and when the path ends, just past some blue crates; turn past the crates to start the agility course.\n\n===Agility course===\n{{Needed|recommended=[[Food]] (if low combat level level or at the minimum agility requirement for the quest)}}\n\nClimb down the steps and into the water. Avoid the moving ice in the water. Climb the stepping stone at the end.\n\nJump to the next stepping stone. Jump to the five next stones. (If you fail you will take minor damage). Then, jump to the land on the other side.\n\nAfter you manage to cross, continue on the path unit you come to a shelf with icicles on it. Use the ''tread softly'' option to get across. You will have to repeat this several times at each shelf. If you fail, you will be hit taking a small amount of damage.\n\nNext, you will have to cross ice; this may prove a little annoying. You will take 2 damage each time you fail.\n\n:[[File:Cold War - Penguin agility course.png|thumb|220px|Crossing the [[Penguin agility course|agility course]].]]\n\nAfter that, you will see a small [[cutscene]] of you sliding down a hill.\n\nSpeak to the [[Agility Instructor]], who will tell you that you have completed the agility arena and are free to return whenever you like.\n\n:'''Note:''' You may re-enter the [[Penguin agility course|agility course]] after completion of the quest if you have made another [[Clockwork suit|penguin suit]].\n\n===Discover the penguin plan===\n{{Needed|[[Mahogany plank]], [[Leather]], [[Cowbells|cowbell]].|recommended=[[Combat equipment]] and [[food]] (if low level)}}\n\nReturn to [[Larry]] (take off your [[Clockwork suit|penguin suit]] to be thrown (teleported) out of the facility and right next to him, or go through the gate and walk back the way you came) and tell him about the army you saw! He will tell you he needs you to find where they are making their war plans.\n\nIf you haven't already, find a [[dairy cow]] and steal a cowbell. One is located in south-east Rellekka. Then, use your [[Mahogany plank|Mahogany Plank]] on the [[Leather]] to make [[Penguin bongos|Penguin Bongos]]. If you have access to the [[fairy ring]] network and '''are not equipped for the upcoming fight''', you can quickly bank by taking the boat back to [[Rellekka]], and using the fairy ring just east of the dock. There is also a dairy cow just on the other side of the field in [[Zanaris]]. Return to the Iceberg (This time, Larry will not teleport you from [[Ardougne Zoo]] or the Lumbridge sheep pen; you will need to take the boat east of [[Rellekka]].)  \n\nTuxedo up and return to the outpost (use avalanche), but instead of turning left this time, head straight until you come to a set of massive doors. Ask the [[KGP Agent]] in the booth to the left of the doors to let you in. He will ask you for your [[Kgp id card|ID]] and say you do not have the clearance to go through the doors.\n\n[[File:Cold War - Ping and Pong play.png|thumb|220px|[[Ping]] and [[Pong]], playing with their new instruments.]]\n{{Listen\n|title = [[The Penguin Bards]]\n|desc = The music played by Ping and Pong.\n|filename = The Penguin Bards.ogg\n}}\nHead back down the hallway and enter the eastern room with [[Ping]] and [[Pong]]. They will ask you for a [[cowbells|cowbell]] and a set of [[penguin bongos]]. Talk to them again to give them the items.\n\nDuring a [[cutscene]], the guard will become distracted by their harmonious vibes. Leave the room and use the [[control panel (Cold War)|controls]] where the KGP agent used to be standing to open the large doors. The war room is to the east.\n\n===Caught by Pescaling Pax===\n{{Listen\n|title = [[Penguin Plots]]\n|desc = The music which plays during various cutscenes throughout the quest.\n|filename = Penguin Plots.ogg\n}}\nYou will see a [[cutscene]] of the penguins planning to take over ''RuneScape''! Due to an anti-magic system that was conveniently installed, you'll be compromised and the penguins will throw you into a cage full of [[icelord]]s. To get out, you may have to kill up to three Icelords, though for some players it is possible to exit after killing just one or two '''Warning:''' Each icelord killed grants 40 Attack experience.\n\nNote that should the player teleport out of the icelord cage, they will be sent back to the cage as soon as they arrive to the Iceberg.\n\nExit the cage through the fence door made of ice; then, exit through a chasm east of the Icelord cage.\n\nTalk to [[Larry]] and inform him of your discovery. Larry will state that he has a lot to do with his other \"contacts\", telling you that he will call for you again when the time comes.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"left\" position=\"center\">\nCold War - Pescaling Pax in the war room.png|The War Room!\nCold War - Caught by Pescaling Pax.png|Your disguise is found out!\nCold War - Giant suit in construction.png|The [[Gigantic penguin|giant penguin]] suit...\n</gallery>\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Cold War\n|image = [[File:Cold War reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Crafting|2,000}} [[Crafting]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Agility|5,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*{{SCP|Construction|1,500}} [[Construction]] experience\n*The ability to make the [[Clockwork suit|penguin suit]].

This is possibly a reference to the popular phrase from {{WP|The Communist Manifesto}} by {{WP|Karl Marx}} and {{WP|Friedrich Engels}}: \"Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains!\"\n**The posters in the penguin outpost are a reference to patriotic murals in communist countries.\n*Throughout the quest, the player will lie to the penguins by saying that they flew by flapping their wings really fast. In addition, if you have completed [[Enlightened Journey]], they will tell the truth saying that they flew in a hot-air balloon. If you have completed [[Between a Rock...]], they will say they were fired out of a cannon.\n**Later during the quest you will see a crazy penguin where they are learning to fly based on the player's answer(s).\n*The secret phrase, ''\"Do not trust the walrus\"'', might be a reference to Lewis Carroll's ''{{WP|The Walrus and the Carpenter}}'', in which the walrus invites some oysters to join them in a walk along the beach, but the two titular characters get hungry and eat all of the oysters. {{WP|John Lennon}} wrote a song \"{{WP|I Am the Walrus}}\" and commented, \"It never dawned on me that Lewis Carroll was commenting on the capitalist and social system. ... the walrus was the bad guy in the story...\"\n*The [[Lumbridge]] penguins in sheep's costume seem to play on the idiom \"{{WP|Wolf in sheep's clothing}}\".\n*''\"Curiouser and curiouser\",'' said by the player just before talking to [[Fred the Farmer]], is a well known line from ''{{WP|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland}}''.\n*[[Ping]] and [[Pong]] talk like {{WP|Beatnik}}s who played {{WP|Bongo drum}}s.\n**{{WP|Cheech & Chong}} were a comedy duo who played stoned hippies.\n**{{WP|Oingo Boingo}} is the name of a music band.\n*Ping says ''\"We need more cowbell\"'', a reference to the \"{{WP|More Cowbell}}\" skit on NBC's popular late night show ''{{WP|Saturday Night Live}}''.

Menaphos cutscene.png|thumb|250px|[[Coenus]] and his men refuse to negotiate peacefully.]]\n[[File:High Priest (Sophanem) chathead.png|left]]\nTravel to [[Sophanem]] and speak to the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]] in the [[Great Temple]] in the south-west of the city. He will tell you that the struggle for [[Klenter]]'s soul continues and that the citizens have been having problems getting in contact with their sister city of [[Menaphos]]. Even though you proved the plague is not contagious, the Menaphites refuse to lift their quarantine and are not open to discussion. Offer your help, for which the high priest is grateful. In a cutscene he recounts how the [[Menaphite Guard]], led by the cruel gatekeeper [[Coenus]], rudely attacked the High Priest's delegation when they approached the gates of Menaphos across the bridge to talk to the Menaphites, who had orders not to let them pass. He explains the [[Pharaoh]] of Menaphos is more secular than the priest would like and respect for the clergy is diminishing.\n\nThe High Priest continues to explain that whilst Sophanem has some contact with the outside world via its own gates and the [[magic carpet]] routes, the city still requires access to Menaphos because many Sophanites are currently stuck there. He wants you to find a way to make contact with them to let them know Sophanem is safe. You can suggest several ideas: the High Priest dismisses a Menaphite disguise, for Coenus would even shoot his mother were she to cross the bridge. It is impossible to scale the walls due to the dangerous [[River Elid]] and the bridge itself is guarded and lit day and night. The High Priest does not wish you to harm the guards in combat, them being the Sophanites' brethren after all, and does not know of any hidden underground passages into Menaphos.\n\n[[File:Sophanem bank ruined.png|thumb|200px|The destroyed bank beneath the temple.]]\nHe goes on to explain the [[Book of Light and Day]]'s story of how [[Tumeken]] created the lesser deities of the [[Menaphite Pantheon]]. He mentions the [[Scabarites|Sect of Scabaras]], one such lesser god, once 'great architects of the subterranean' until being smitten by [[Elidinis]]. He directs you to the [[Temple of the Lesser Gods]] in the north-east of the city, which contains a shrine to Scabaras. The High Priest tells you to talk to its caretaker [[Jex]].\n\nFind Jex in the temple in the north-eastern corner of the city; it has a broken altar inside. He will tell you that the temple and its cellar, including the bank, were destroyed when strange scarab creatures burst inside from some kind of dungeon a few months ago, forcing the Sophanites to fight them back. He recommends that you do not go inside; many townsfolk have died in the dark cave due to the vicious monsters and dangerous traps. Upon hearing you are working for the High Priest, Jex blesses you and explains how to open the barricaded trapdoor beneath the temple. He advises you to be very careful and to bring a [[light source]].\n\n===The Sect of Scabaras===\n[[File:Sophanem dungeon map.png|thumb|300px|A map of the [[Sophanem Dungeon]].]]\nGo down a level and talk to a [[Sophanem guard|guard]]. The two will explain that they are guarding the trapdoor to make sure nothing comes out and nobody in, thinking the monsters below are related to the ancient Sect of Scabaras. They also mention they were not in Sophanem when the plague broke out, as they were trying to capture [[Simon Templeton]]. They will also sell you a [[torch]] for 200 [[coins]] and a [[tinderbox]] for 50. It is '''strongly recommended''' that you take good [[food]], a tinderbox, a [[light source]], an [[antipoison]] potion, and an emergency escape [[teleport]] such as the [[ectophial]]; as the next step after completing this section requires travel to [[Al Kharid]], bringing a [[Ring of dueling]] is also prudent. It is best not to bring any valuables in case of death. Make your way through the [[multicombat]] maze to the other end and go down the right ladder. Most ladders lead to even more dangerous caves below containing more Scabarites.\n\n====Traps====\nThe dungeon is riddled with various types of traps, which should generally be avoided or bypassed.\n\nYou will also encounter [[scarab mage]]s, [[scarab swarm]]s, and [[locust rider]]s. These can be very dangerous, and it is recommended you use [[Prayer]] against these foes. Scarab swarms can [[poison]] and will only appear if you step on a sand pit trap.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Image\n!Description\n|-\n|[[File:Floor trap.png|150px]]\n|'''Floor trap - Spikes:''' Similar to the floor traps found in the [[Rogues' Den]] (but easier to see - \"X\" markings on floor), these can be avoided using [[Agility]] by selecting \"Evade Trap\". If you run over them, you will be hit for 10% of current hitpoints, rounded down, plus 10 [[hitpoints]]. At level 84 Agility, players no longer run the risk of triggering these traps when using the \"Evade\" option.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1283443075008864256|date=15 July 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/vXjNl|archivedate=12 June 2023|quote=Looks to me like around 83-84 should do it, for both.|name=LightStep}}<!--ObjectID 20271-->\n|-\n|[[File:Odd markings.png|150px]]\n|'''Wall trap:''' Similar to the wall traps in [[Rogues' Den]], these can be disabled by [[Thieving]] by selecting \"Disable Trap\". If you run through them, you will be hit for 10% of current hitpoints, rounded down, plus 10 [[hitpoints]]. At level 84 Thieving, players no longer run the risk of triggering these traps when using the \"Disable\" option.{{NamedRef|LightStep}}<!--ObjectID 20272-->\n|-\n|[[File:Wall crusher.png|150px]]\n|'''[[Wall Crusher]]:''' These are also found in the pyramid in [[Icthlarin's Little Helper]]. Simply, move diagonally carefully around them. If you run into them, you will be hit for 8 [[hitpoints]] of damage. ('''Note''': You can run through these without taking damage by just clicking past them with run enabled).\n|-\n|[[File:Contact! - Sand pit.png|150px]]\n|'''Sand pits:''' Barely visible circles on the ground. If you step on these, the ground will crack open and a [[Scarab swarm]] will come out. This can be avoided by walking around the pit.\n|-\n|[[File:Scarab trap.png|150px]]\n|'''Scarab trap:''' Similar to the pits in [[Desert Treasure I]], these pits appear if you stand next to a wall spot with a scarab symbol on it. This will extinguish your [[Light sources|light source]] and cause you to fall down to the bottom level.\n|}\n\n====Tips====\nIn the [[Combat Options]] tab, '''turn [[Auto Retaliate]] off''' in order to avoid unnecessary use of food or [[prayer points]]; accidentally retaliating against an attack may cause you to run into a trap if you are hit at an inopportune moment. Go down the trapdoor and follow the dungeon around until you get to the ladder north of the south-west corner using the [[Protect from Magic]] prayer. When following the route to the right, you will only encounter [[scarab mage]]s. Therefore, use Protect from Magic and keep auto-retaliate off. The mages hit high but attack very slowly; it is therefore possible to only pray against one attack with ample time to run past. The [[locust rider]]s use [[ranged]] and likewise hit high but attack slowly.\n\nThe ladders in the dungeon all lead to a '''much''' more dangerous lower level of the dungeon. If you go down the wrong ladder or fall down a pit, you will be placed in the lower portion of the dungeon. There are level 98 and 106 locust riders and lots of Scarab mages. It is a [[multicombat area]] and your [[hitpoints]] will be reduced very quickly. Find a ladder and get out fast or use an emergency teleport. If you have enough protection, this level could be a shortcut going from the north middle ladder '''(2)''' to the south-west ladder '''(6)'''. Then, go up, east, north, and west to the exit ladder.\n\n'''{{Colour|Red|Warning}}:''' Unless you have an inextinguishable [[Light sources|light source]], such as a piece of [[Kandarin headgear]], a [[bruma torch]], or the [[Firemaking cape]], your [[Light sources|light source]] can be extinguished at any time (even [[bullseye lantern]]s). If this happens, use a [[tinderbox]] to light it again.\n\n===Kaleef's corpse===\n[[File:Maisa chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:Contact! Kaleef's corpse.png|thumb|220px|Kaleef's dead body in the depths beneath Sophanem.]]\nOnce you have found the correct ladder (being the one directly north of the south-westernmost one; you unlock a new music track), follow the passage around until you come to the corpse of [[Kaleef]]. There are no more dangers here. Search Kaleef's body to get his [[Parchment (Contact!)|notes]] and read them. They are orders from 'Os' to Kaleef to contact an agent inside Menaphos using the Scabarite tunnels beneath the Temple of the Lesser Gods.\n\nGo slightly west and speak to [[Maisa]], a woman stood at the other end of a gaping chasm. She will expect Kaleef, of whose death you inform her, causing her to cry. She curses [[Osman]], the Spymaster of [[Al Kharid]], and says she wants to go home; Kaleef was supposed to tell her how to get out of Menaphos. To win her trust, tell her you have helped rescue [[Prince Ali]], who was being held in [[Draynor Village]] and that [[Leela]] assisted you. She will then agree to cooperate and tell you to tell Osman to come to the cave, after which she will inform the Sophanites inside Menaphos that it is safe to return. She emphasises that Osman himself should come, and not another one of his agents.\n\n===I Spy with my Little Eye===\n[[File:Osman chathead.png|left]]\nTravel to [[Al Kharid]] and speak to [[Osman]] outside the palace. Try and convince him that his help is needed most urgently in [[Sophanem]]. Initially, he will not believe you spoke to Maisa, claiming she is inside Menaphos, locked to the outside world 'thanks in no small part to [him],' as he had his agents stir up civil unrest in the city. Upon being informed of the situation with Kaleef and Maisa, Osman will agree to send one of his people to the dungeon but refuses to come himself, saying he would be lynched on sight. Osman explains Al Kharid and Menaphos were at war for centuries, the Menaphites' trying to expand their dominion northwards. Despite the official peace, there remains much bad blood between the two and Osman claims to have done 'many a dark deed' as Spy Master.\n\n[[File:Contact! - Osman sneaking.png|thumb|220px|[[Osman]] sneaks into the temple after knocking [[Jex]] out.]]\nYou explain that the plague of Sophanem is not contagious and the High Priest wants to open the town again and allow its inhabitants to return from Menaphos. Osman asks why he would help you with this plan that would benefit the enemy of Al Kharid. Trying to convince him that it is more thrilling than standing around in Al Kharid, getting to spy on the Menaphites himself or the promise of graverobbed treasures beneath Sophanem will not do the trick; Osman has his people for doing the spying and does not wish to rob the dead and end up like [[Simon Templeton]]. He is susceptible to the idea of driving a wedge between the two cities Sophanem and Menaphos, however. He will agree to help and meet you at the gates of Sophanem after dealing with a few more things.\n\nBefore travelling back, equip yourself for a big fight and another journey through the tunnels. Bring good [[food]] and some [[prayer potion]]s as well as previous supplies to traverse the maze, such as your light source. [[Super potion set]]s are recommended if you're using [[melee]], as the monsters may hit over 20 and the final boss is fairly resistant to melee and Ranged. [[Iban Blast]] and [[Ice Rush]] spells are quite effective.\n\nReturn to Sophanem. Osman will be just outside the gates, unable to find a way in without attracting undue attention. Suggest the secret entrance just north of the city that you had used [[Icthlarin's Little Helper|previously]]. He will decide to split up to avoid getting caught together, stating that he knows his way around Sophanem. A [[cutscene]] then shows Osman sneaking into the city, luring [[Jex]] out of sight, knocking the hapless man unconscious, and getting into the caves below the temple. You then decide to look for Osman inside the cave.\n\n===Beetle battle===\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Contact! Osman and Maisa.png|thumb|250px|Osman instructs Maisa.]]\n{{Needed|recommended=[[Food]], [[prayer potion]]s and [[combat equipment]] to defeat a level 191 [[Giant Scarab]].}}\nIf you want, talk to Jex for some amusing dialogue about his being attacked by some 'degenerate' he suspects to be [[Siamun]]. He also comments that his temple is still in its sorry state, for most Sophanites mainly revere [[Icthlarin]], and Simon Templeton stole some of the damaged masonry. Go back through the [[Sophanem Dungeon]] to where you found the body of [[Kaleef]]. As soon as you go down the ladder, you will see another [[cutscene]].\n\n[[File:Giant scarab appears.gif|thumb|left|250px|A [[giant scarab]] manifests itself.]]\nOsman is seen talking to Maisa across the chasm, imploring her to stay disguised. Suddenly the caves starts to shake. Maisa flees into Menaphos whilst Osman is surrounded by [[scarab swarm]]s appearing from cracks in the ground. They merge into one [[giant scarab]] that attacks Osman. He is seemingly knocked out and vanishes from sight.\n\nHead into the cave and fight the level 191 giant scarab, which hits up to 20 with [[melee]] and ranged (the ranged attack looks like [[earth blast]]). Keep an eye on your hitpoints or game messages, as the scarab can poison you through anti-poison, negating your poison timer. It can also summon level 68 [[Locust rider]]s and [[Scarab mage]]s (which can also do 9 damage with [[poison]]) to aid it, which will attack at the same time. The riders will attack with ranged or melee and the mages will attack with slow but powerful [[magic]], so you are being attacked by all three [[combat style]]s at once. It is recommended to focus on the scarab, unless you find that you are taking too much damage, in which case defeat the minions as soon as they spawn depending on which style you pray against. Note that a cannon cannot be used during this fight.\n\n'''If you're using melee,''' you will require pretty high stats (70 or better). [[Protect from Melee]] is recommended against the scarab, and having plenty of good [[food]] such as sharks is recommended, you may also need a prayer potion as the scarab has incredibly high defence and drags out the fight. Wearing [[dragonhide armour]] alongside mid-tier melee boots, gloves and helmet (such as a [[Helm of neitiznot]]) will help protect against both Magic and Ranged - anything lower than this will lead to relying on good hits to win the fight. You should kill the ranger or mager as soon as they spawn, as more will continuously spawn throughout the fight. Simply hit the scarab in-between spawns. \n[[File:Contact! giant scarab fight.png|thumb|260px|Fighting the [[giant scarab]] and its Scabarites.]]\n'''If you're using Ranged''', use a [[rune crossbow]] with [[broad bolts]] or higher, or use a [[crystal bow]]. Anything lower will cause problems, due to the scarab's high [[Defence]]. Use [[Karil the Tainted's equipment]] or [[black dragonhide armour]], and use the [[safespot]] also listed in the mage tips below. Doing range any other way is not very effective in this battle. Use [[Protect from Missiles]], if you can not get to the safespot, get the [[Scarab mage]] and the [[Locust rider]]s to spawn. Trap the Scarab Mage on either side of the wall, that is on your right, when passing Kaleef's body. The Locust Rider, and the Giant Scarab shouldn't be able to melee you, on either side of this wall, so just turn on your protect from range. This takes more setup than the mage option, but once you have it set up, it is just as easy.\n\n'''If you're using Magic''', there are various safespots in the cave; hide there and use [[Protect from Missiles]]. For example, one may safespot from the entrance, near Kaleef's corpse. Using [[mystic robes]] or better in tandem with the [[Iban Blast]] spell is an effective approach, due to the scarab's low [[Magic]] level. [[Fire spells]] are also effective, dealing an extra 50% damage due to the scarab's [[elemental weakness]]. With a magic-focused setup and use of [[protection prayers]], it is an extremely easy fight for players with decent stats.\n\n===Contact established===\nOnce the scarab is defeated, any remaining Scabarites will die and the three scarab swarms disappear. [[Osman]], dishevelled and slightly injured, reappears, having blended into the shadows, claiming the situation was under control. He tells you to take the [[Keris]] dagger on the floor, which Kaleef had used to pierce the bug's shell from behind. He thanks you and teleports away. {{Bug|If you teleport out of the dungeon before the conversation with Osman, you will simply need to talk to the High Priest to finish the quest. Upon travelling back to the dungeon through the maze, Osman will not be there. You will need to talk to Osman in Al Kharid to receive your Keris for free instead.}}\n\n:''If you have enough food remaining, killing a locust rider with the Keris is a [[Desert Diary#Hard|hard Desert Diary]] task. One is also found just up the ladder. The wall trap in the passage to the southern corridor (and only that one) will have been rendered broken by rust.''\n\nIn Sophanem, the townsfolk from Menaphos have returned and business, albeit slowly, is starting to return to normal. Go back to the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]]. If you have little food left, teleporting away and coming back via the [[magic carpet]]s may be safer and probably faster than going through the dungeon again. He will confirm that [[Maisa]] was indeed successful and reward you with a magic lamp granting two wishes.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Contact!\n|image = [[File:Contact! reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Thieving|7,000}} [[Thieving]] [[experience]]\n*[[Combat lamp]] giving two wishes granting 7,000 experience to {{SCP|Attack}} [[Attack]], {{SCP|Strength}} [[Strength]], {{SCP|Defence}} [[Defence]], {{SCP|Hitpoints}} [[Hitpoints]], {{SCP|Ranged}} [[Ranged]], or {{SCP|Magic}} [[Magic]]\n*The [[Keris]] dagger\n*Access to [[Sophanem]]'s shops including: [[bank]], [[Blades by Urbi.]], [[Nathifa's Bake Stall.]], [[The Spice Is Right.]]\n*The music track [[Back to Life]] and [[The Spymaster]]\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Giant scarab]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Contact! is required for the following:\n*[[Beneath Cursed Sands]]\n*Hard tier of the [[Desert Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Unlock details\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Music track\n|-\n|[[The Gates of Menaphos]]\n|Plays during the High Priest's encounter with Coenus\n|[[File:The Gates of Menaphos.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Labyrinth]]\n|Unlocked in the Scabarite maze below Sophanem\n|[[File:Labyrinth.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[The Depths]]\n|Unlocked in the deepest part of the caves beneath Sophanem\n|[[File:The Depths.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[The Spymaster]]\n|Plays when Osman sneaks into Sophanem\n|[[File:The Spymaster.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Beetle Juice]]\n|Unlocked in the same cave when the giant scarab is present\n|[[File:Beetle Juice.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Back to Life]]\n|Unlocked in Sophanem upon quest completion\n|[[File:Back to Life.ogg]]\n|}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 27 April 2022\n|update = Beneath Cursed Sands\n|change = \n*Fixed a few plotholes and inconsistencies in the Icthlarin's Little Helper and Contact! quests.\n*Removed some inappropriate dialogue from the Prince Ali Rescue, Icthlarin's Little Helper and Contact! quests.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Contact!}}\n{{Sophanem}}"

When speaking to the cook with these items in your inventory, the player will say that they happen to have those items with them, and the cook will ask if they were planning on baking a cake, thereby completing the quest in seconds.\n\n==Walkthrough==\n===A feast for a Duke===\n[[File:Cook's Assistant - Lumbridge kitchen.png|thumb|300x300px|The quest start location.]]\n[[File:Cook (Lumbridge) chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nBegin the quest by speaking with the Lumbridge [[Cook (Lumbridge)|cook]] found in the kitchen on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} of [[Lumbridge Castle]]. He mentions it is [[Duke Horacio]]'s birthday and that he is supposed to bake the Duke a [[cake]]. Unfortunately, however, he has forgotten to buy the ingredients and asks the player to bring him a [[bucket of milk]], an [[egg]], and a [[pot of flour]].\n\n====Bucket and pot====\nA [[bucket]] spawns in the cellar of Lumbridge Castle, and a [[pot]] spawns in the kitchen on the centre table. You can also purchase both a bucket and a pot from the [[Lumbridge General Store]] for {{NoCoins|2}} and {{NoCoins|1}} [[coins]], respectively.\n\n====Egg====\n[[File:Cook's Assistant - Chicken coop.png|thumb|300x300px|The location for an [[egg]], found in the coop north of [[Lumbridge]].]]\nGo east out of [[Lumbridge Castle]] and run north along the path until you reach the [[chicken]] [[coop]] north-west of [[Fred the Farmer|Farmer Fred]]'s house. Go into the coop and pick up an [[egg]].\n\n====Bucket of milk====\n[[File:Cook's Assistant - Dairy cow.png|300x300px|thumb|Milking a [[dairy cow]].]]\nWith an empty [[bucket]], go north into the [[cow]] pasture. Use the empty bucket on a [[dairy cow]] to get a [[bucket of milk]]. You can optionally talk to [[Gillie Groats]] for an explanation on how to milk a cow. She can be found across the [[River Lum|river]] next to the dairy cow in the eastern [[Lumbridge cow field]].\n\n====Pot of flour====\nWith an empty [[pot]], leave the cow pasture and go south-west to the wheat field. Pick some [[grain]], and then enter the [[Mill Lane Mill]], found up the road to the north-east. Climb to the top floor, put the grain in the hopper, then pull the lever and climb back down to the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}. Finally, use an empty pot on the [[flour bin]] (which is now full of flour) to get a [[pot of flour]]. You can optionally talk to [[Millie Miller]] inside the mill for an explanation on how to make [[pot of flour|flour]].\n\n===Delivery===\nAfter collecting the ingredients, speak to the [[Cook (Lumbridge)|cook]] to deliver them.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Cook's Assistant\n|image=[[File:Cook's Assistant reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n* {{SCP|Cooking|300|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n* Permission to use the [[Cooking range (Lumbridge Castle)|Cook-o-matic 100]], which reduces the chance of burning some [[food]]s.\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nThe completion of Cook's Assistant is a requirement to complete the following:\n* [[Recipe for Disaster]]\n* [[Easy Lumbridge & Draynor Diary]]: ''Bake some bread on the Lumbridge castle kitchen range.''\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* There is an [[wikipedia:Easter_egg_(media)|easter egg]] in the [[Death to the Dorgeshuun]] quest. When you introduce [[Zanik]] to the [[Cook (Lumbridge)|cook]], he tries to offer the quest to her, saying, \"In fact, it's a good thing I met you. It's the Duke's birthday today, and I should be making him a lovely big birthday cake. I need eggs, flour, and milk...\" The player then tells the cook that Zanik does not have time for that, to which he responds, \"It was worth a try.\" This insinuates that the cook asks all newcomers to bring him supplies.\n* During the [[20th Anniversary event]], it was revealed that the cook has attempted and failed to bake a cake countless times, explaining his recurring need for ingredients from new adventurers.\n* The [[Cook (servant)|cook]] at the [[Servants' Guild]] of [[Ardougne]] references this quest in her dialogue, saying, \"Overnight I was fired and replaced by some fool who can't even bake a cake without help!\"\n\n{{Cook's Assistant}}"

He will tell you that his crew of corsairs (pirates) has been inflicted with a curse and asks for your help. After you agree to help him, a brief cut scene will show you where you can find the boat (the dock at the western end of [[Rimmington]]); speak to Captain Tock again on the dock to sail to [[Corsair Cove]].\n\n{{Map|mtype=pin|align=right|caption=A map of all the important locations visited during the quest.\n|2523,2861,title:[[Chief Tess]],desc:\n|2579,2840,title:[[Captain Tock]],desc:\n|2531,2833,title:[[Ithoi the Navigator]],desc:\n|2545,2862,title:[[Gnocci the Cook]],desc:\n|2556,2856,title:[[Arsen the Thief]] and [[Cabin Boy Colin]],desc:\n|2503,2839,title:Possessed doll,desc:\n}}\nIf you haven't obtained a [[spade]] and [[tinderbox]] already, a tinderbox can be found beside Gnocci the Cook, and a spade can be found planted in the sand under the big Tropical Tree south of Gnocci the Cook's hut, near the rocks. Note that neither the spade nor the tinderbox appear as a red dot in the mini map.\n\n=== Ithoi's ideas ===\n[[File:Ithoi the Navigator chathead.png|left|frameless|width=110x110]]\nVisit Ithoi first in his hut, south-west of the Corsair Cove. He will claim there is a curse, and that there are many things that can cause them.\n\nAfter talking to Ithoi, investigate what may have caused the curse by speaking to Arsen, Colin, and Gnocci in any order. Refer to the map for their exact locations. Note that they are each ''upstairs'' in their huts, and you need to climb the stairs to reach them. Each will tell you they caused the curse with various events that occurred to each respectively. Arsen and Colin are upstairs in the large hut found immediately west of the dock, and Gnocci is upstairs in the smaller hut slightly further to the west. Each crew member's claim will need to be investigated further.\n\n===Arsen's appropriation===\n[[File:Arsen the Thief chathead.png|left|width=90x90]]\n[[Arsen the Thief]] will explain that he was asked by Captain Tock to explore some caves west of the cove. On entering, he was immediately spotted by the ogres in the cave, and in a panic, grabbed some loot and quickly fled. He believes he may have stolen a sacred relic, and says the shamans have cursed his crew for stealing it.\n\nSpeak to Captain Tock, located on the ship, and ask him for the relic. As he has no use for it, he will give you the [[Ogre artefact (The Corsair Curse)|ogre artefact]].\n\nHead west of the cove and down the hole into the [[Corsair Cove Dungeon]]. Speak to [[Chief Tess]] at the entrance, and she will tell you that he simply grabbed one of her many tooth-picks, and that her shamans have not cursed the crew.\n\nReturn to Arsen to explain what actually happened. Arsen is now assured that the curse was not his fault.\n\n===Colin's catcall===\n[[File:The Corsair Curse - Colin sees a mermaid.png|thumb|right|Colin sees a mermaid through Ithoi's telescope.]]\n[[File:Cabin Boy Colin chathead.png|left|width=76x76]]\n[[Cabin Boy Colin]] believes he may have offended a mermaid after he saw one using Ithoi's telescope. He thinks that perhaps the mermaid didn't like strangers shouting about her appearance and blowing kisses at her, and that she cursed the crew as a result.\n\nUse the telescope in Ithoi's hut and discover that the mermaid Colin was referring to is an [[ogre]] named [[Bugs]]. If you have completed [[Big Chompy Bird Hunting]], you will recognise him as [[Rantz]]'s son.\n\nReturn to Colin to explain what actually happened. Colin is now assured that the curse was not his fault.\n\n===Gnocci's no-no===\n[[File:Gnocci the Cook chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:The Corsair Curse - possessed doll location.png|thumb|300px|Dig here to find the Demonic Doll]]\n[[Gnocci the Cook]] will tell you that while fishing for food, he discovered a doll possessed by a demon and buried it next to the tree where he was fishing. He believes that this demon cursed the crew, and asks you to kill it.\n\nDig by the lump of sand to the far west of Ithoi's hut (just west of the fishing spot) where he buried the doll during the cutscene. You will discover it is a clockwork [[toy doll]]. If you have at least level {{SCP|Crafting|18|link=yes}}, you will also say that you know how to make a doll just like it.\n\nReturn to Gnocci to explain what actually happened. Gnocci is assured that the curse was not his fault.\n\n===Traitor in the midst===\n[[File:Francois chathead.png|left|frameless|width=90x90]]\nAt this point your quest log should end with, \"I had{{sic}} ruled out all the corsairs' theories about how they had become cursed;\" if not, repeat your conversations with each corsair as needed.\n\nAfter debunking [[Arsen]], [[Colin]], and [[Gnocci]]'s \"curses,\" return to Captain Tock on the boat. He will explain to you that the curse began when he and [[Ithoi]] went away for a parlay and returned to find their crew sickly after eating dinner, with Ithoi soon falling ill as well. As Ithoi was with Captain Tock at the time, he rules out the food as the cause of the curse.\n\nSpeak to Gnocci to discover that he didn't cook dinner that night, as he was still traumatised from the \"possessed\" doll. Gnocci will tell you that Ithoi cooked dinner that night, before leaving for his parlay with Captain Tock. He will also rule out the food as the cause of the curse.\n\nNext, speak to Arsen. He will reveal that his brother, [[Francois]], told him that Ithoi may be dismissed from Tock's crew, as they have settled in the Cove and no longer need a navigator.\n\nSpeak to Ithoi, and tell him that you heard he cooked the meal that made the crew sick. He will believe you are accusing him of poisoning his crew, and asks why you would think so. Mention that you know the Captain is thinking of firing him and he will confess to the crime, saying that he hoped if the crew believed they were cursed, they would want Ithoi to stay on the crew.\n[[File:The Corsair Curse - Ithoi extinguishes fire.png|thumb|200px|Ithoi runs out to extinguish your fire, proving that he is faking the curse.]]\nSpeak to Ithoi again and tell him you know the curse is fake. He will tell you he will not get up, thus making you unable to prove he is faking his illness. Leave the hut and use the [[tinderbox]] on the driftwood beneath Ithoi's hut, prompting him to get up and run outside to douse the flame with magic.\n\nReturn to [[Captain Tock]], and tell him Ithoi is behind the curse. Outraged, Captain Tock will ask you to kill Ithoi.\n\n===Taking care of Ithoi===\n[[File:Ithoi the Navigator.png|left|frameless|width=231x231]]\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Fighting Ithoi the Navigator.png|thumb|right|200px|The player confronts Ithoi.]]\nReturn to Ithoi's hut, and climb the stairs to begin the final fight.\n\nUpon climbing up, Ithoi will attack you immediately. He is level 35 and uses elemental [[strike spells]]. He can also use the [[Curse]] spell. Lower-leveled players should bring food for this fight, as while he does splash quite often, he can still deal considerable damage. ''Make sure that if you are using ranged attacks, you are comfortable losing the arrows or bolts that you use during the fight, as they will disappear at the end of the fight.'' \n\nIt is possible to flinch Ithoi if you have low stats and gear by running to the nearby telescope; he will become trapped on one side of the hut entrance, allowing you to attack him and run back to the safespot until he is dead.\n\nAfter killing Ithoi, leave his hut and return to Captain Tock, who will ask what is happening now. Explain to him that Ithoi was killed for poisoning his crew. He will thank you and say that he plans to let the crew members rest and get better. He will also mention that he will speak to [[Yusuf]], located in the bank north of the ship, allowing access to bank on the cove.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Corsair Curse\n|image = [[File:The Corsair Curse reward scroll.png|center]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards =\n*Access to [[Yusuf]]'s bank in the [[Corsair Cove]].\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Corsair Traitor]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*During the cutscene of Gnocci the Cook fishing for lobsters, he chants \"Obby-lobby Obby-lobby oi oi oi\". This is likely a reference to the \"{{wp|Oggy Oggy Oggy|Oggy Oggy Oggy! Oi Oi Oi!}}\" chant that is popular among crowds at rugby matches in Wales.  \n*Oggy is a pasty in Cornwall, and the chant \"Oggy Oggy Oggy\" originated from Wales. Both Wales and Cornwall are also historically famous for pirates.\n*In response to the debunked clockwork doll, Captain Tock says, \"Arr, any sufficiently advanced technology be indistinguishable from demonic possession, that it be\". This is a reference to {{wp|Clarke's three laws}}, the third of which states, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\".\n*Captain Tock used to appear as a red dot on the [[minimap]] while aboard the ship, instead of a yellow dot. This was a bug that has been fixed.\n*Prior to [[Update:Boss Heads and Chambers of Xeric|an update]], Captain Tock's boat was located in Port Sarim, where [[Veos]]'s boat currently is. This made the Corsair Cove bank one of the closest banks to [[Entrana]] with the lowest requirements. Since the update, it has been replaced by the [[Land's End]] bank.\n*When the quest is completed, Captain Tock is replaced by [[Cabin Boy Colin]], who provides the option to travel between Corsair Cove and Rimmington.\n*The cook's name, Gnocci, is likely a reference to the food ''{{wp|Gnocchi}}''. The \"gn\" is simply pronounced as an \"n,\" like in the word \"gnome.\"\n*If you talk to Madame Caldarium and respond to her statement \"I guess so\", your character will make a reference to ''{{wp|Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones}}'', where Anakin says, \"I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere\".\n*The quest was released on the 7th of December 2017 as part of a teaser update for [[Dragon Slayer II]].\n\n{{The Corsair Curse}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Corsair Curse, The}}"

Then, go to [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]]. Talk to [[Dr Fenkenstrain]] and a job interview will commence. When asked to describe yourself in one word, answer \"braindead\" and that your best skill is \"grave-digging\".\n\nDr Fenkenstrain hires you and you will receive a mission to retrieve 5 body parts in any order:\n\n*[[Decapitated head]]\n*[[Pickled brain]]\n*[[Torso (Creature of Fenkenstrain)|Torso]]\n*[[Arms]]\n*[[Legs]]\n\nBefore leaving the castle prepare for the next sections to avoid unnecessary trips back and forth. First, go upstairs and search the East and West bookcases to retrieve books 'The Joy of Grave Digging' and 'Handy Maggot Avoidance Techniques', combine the amulet pieces. Then go downstairs and talk to the headless Gardener Ghost, asking what happened to his head.\n\n===Head===\n{{Needed|[[Ghostspeak amulet]], [[spade]].

Ask him his name first, and he will tell you his name is Ed Lestwit. You will need to know this in order to identify his grave.\n\nNext, ask him what happened to his head, and he will explain that it got chopped off while he was digging a grave in the [[Haunted Woods]]. You will then ask him to show you where the place was, and he will follow you for ten minutes.\n\nYou can talk to him while in the woods and he will direct you toward his grave.

Search the east bookcase for \"Handy Maggot Avoidance Techniques\" and you will find an [[obsidian amulet]]. Use them on each other to get a [[star amulet]].\nExit [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]], and go east along the path to find some tombstones. Use the [[star amulet]] on the furthest [[memorial (Experiment cave)|memorial]] to the east with the indent on it and push it to enter a dungeon that contains level 25 and 51 [[Experiment]]s. Kill a level 51 wolf-woman [[Experiment]] to get a [[cavern key]].\n\n'''''Note''': If you have started [[Rag and Bone Man II]], you may wish to kill the level 25 experiments here until you receive an [[Experiment bone]].''\n\nOnce you have the cavern key go through the north-west passage until you reach a gate.

Exit the cavern and follow the path west until you reach [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]].\n\nIf you haven't already, use the [[pickled brain]] on the [[decapitated head]], and give the body parts to [[Fenkenstrain]]. He will ask you for a [[needle]] and five spools of [[thread]] to sew the body together. Give them to him to receive yet another assignment. Fenkenstrain notes having a complete body, but with no life within it.\n[[File:Creature of Fenkenstrain - Cleaning the Fireplace.png|thumb|200px|Cleaning the Fireplace.]]\nYou now need to fix the lightning rod so that the castle will get struck by lightning, bringing the monster to life. Ask the [[Gardener Ghost]] for the [[shed key]]. (Notice on some occasions, the ghost doesn't reappear after leading him to the grave near the [[Haunted Woods]]. Re-logging will fix this issue.) The shed is found at the very north end of the castle. Go inside and search the [[Cupboard (Creature of Fenkenstrain)|cupboard]] for the [[garden brush]]. Take three of the [[garden cane]]s just east of the shed and use them on the brush with the [[bronze wire]] in your inventory, (you will need 20 [[Crafting]] to do this and the bronze wire will be used up to tie the canes to the brush). This will create an [[extended brush]], making it suitable for chimney sweeping. Go back inside, take the staircase to the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} and use it on the fireplace in the west room to get a [[conductor mould]]. Make sure you use it on the \"fireplace\" and not the \"fireplace surround.\"\n\nOnce you have the mould, you need to go to a [[furnace]] with a [[silver bar]] in your inventory. Use the [[silver bar]] and the [[conductor mould]] on a furnace to make the [[conductor]] (via the 'make lightning rod' option).\n\n:'''Note:''' On some occasions, you will be unable to make the conductor. Re-logging will fix this issue. In some cases you have to talk to the gardener to get the option to make the conductor in the furnace. The nearest furnace is in [[Port Phasmatys]] (2 ecto-tokens needed to enter, free if [[Ghosts Ahoy]] has been completed). Alternatively, one could teleport to [[Falador]] or [[Lumbridge]] to use a [[furnace]], or use the fairy ring (code {{fairycode|ALQ}}) south of the [[Haunted Woods]] to teleport to [[Zanaris]], and use the [[furnace]] directly north of the fairy ring. To return, one could use an [[ectophial]], [[Varrock]] teleport, or use the fairy ring.\n\n[[File:Creature of Fenkenstrain - repairing conductor.gif|thumb|160px|The conductor is repaired.]]\nGo back to [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]]; take the stairs on either the eastern or western side of the castle up to the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}}, walk to the room furthest south, and climb the ladder to the roof. Click on the [[lightning conductor]] to fix it. Lightning will instantly strike and the monster comes to life!\n\n===Lord Rologarth===\nTalk to [[Dr Fenkenstrain]] again. He will tell you that the monster tried to kill him, so he locked it in the tower. He will give you the [[tower key]] and tell you to kill the monster. Go upstairs again, and enter the central room of the upstairs section, climb the ladder, and talk to Fenkenstrain's monster.\n[[File:Creature of Fenkenstrain - He Lives!.png|thumb|200px|It's alive! ...and it talks!]]\nThe monster will introduce himself as [[Lord Rologarth]]. He will tell you the true story of how Fenkenstrain tricked him into selling all of his subjects and himself to the [[vampyre]]s, and ask you to stop him from doing anything more. Go back downstairs and pickpocket Fenkenstrain to obtain the [[ring of charos]].\n\n''Note: The quest may be completed all the way to this point without having the proper level, but in order to pickpocket Dr Fenkenstrain, you must have 25 [[Thieving]].''\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Creature of Fenkenstrain\n|image = [[File:Creature of Fenkenstrain reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Thieving|1,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*The [[Ring of charos]], which allows access to the [[Werewolf Agility Course]], and, when activated during [[Garden of Tranquillity]], reduced cost to many transport links.\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Creature of Fenkenstrain is required for the following:\n*[[Garden of Tranquillity]]\n*[[The Great Brain Robbery]]\n*[[Rag and Bone Man II]] (Only partial completion of Creature of Fenkenstrain required)\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although not necessary for the completion of this quest, you can find a [[Letter (Creature of Fenkenstrain)|letter]] when winding the clock upstairs in [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]]. This letter, written by [[Lord Rologarth]] (the true owner of the castle), reveals the dark story of [[Dr Fenkenstrain]]'s past.\n*The grave examine reveals a bit of funny wordplay regarding the unlucky gardener's name, \"Here lies Ed Lestwit\". Roughly pronounced Headless Twit.\n*The quest is based heavily on the concept of the story of ''{{wp|Frankenstein}}'' by {{wp|Mary Shelley}}.\n*Dr Fenkenstrain's examine text ''Dr Fenkenstrain, I presume'' is likely a reference to the famous quote ''Dr Livingstone I presume''.\n*After the quest Dr Fenkenstrain's note on the signpost in Canifis is replaced by a new note just saying \"AAARRGGGHHHHH!!!!!\"\n*Based on the body parts that were exhumed, you can calculate the average weight of an NPC to be around 35kg.\n*The book \"The Joy of Grave Digging\" is a reference to Irma S. Rombauer's famous cooking book \"The Joy of Cooking\".\n\n{{Creature of Fenkenstrain}}"

You will travel to [[Meiyerditch]].\n\n===Welcome to Meiyerditch===\n[[File:Floating Vyre.png|thumb|Arriving in Meiyerditch.]]\nYou will arrive at the very southern, damaged end of the wall. Jump over a gap and climb up, then move to where the wall turns north (if you pass the rubble (the destroyed part of the wall) you've gone too far). Search the floor to the right of the wall (right-click option) and kick the boards in. Climb down into the passage below.\n\nHead into the town and talk to any local citizen. Ask them about the Myreque, then whisper that you really need to meet them. They will tell you to speak to [[Old Man Ral]]. Speak to them again and ask if they can introduce you to him. They will tell you to say a friend recommended him.\n\nOld Man Ral is a little north-east of the place you enter Meiyerditch (three buildings north of the wall rubble that you climbed over -- Old Man Ral is one building north of [[Trader Sven]]). Speak to Old Man Ral and tell him; ''\"Someone said you could help me\",'' then call him the ''\"Sage of Sanguinesti\".''\n\nHe should now tell you that you need to get to Sector 3 of the city by following sickle symbols on the walls.\n\n'''''Optional:''' Just to the south, [[Trader Sven]] sells the [[Vyrewatch outfit]]. While travelling through the city, the [[Vyrewatch]] will occasionally stop you and wearing the disguise causes them to do this less often. This is only recommended if you have a low Thieving or Hitpoints level, as the Vyrewatch are not very dangerous. When stopped, you have three (and later, four) options:'' \n\n* ''Pay a blood tithe (hits 6 [[Hitpoints]]). '''Chosen by default if you don't select an option.'''''\n* ''\"Bring it on\". The Vyrewatch will attack you, allowing you to run away. '''The Vyrewatch are invulnerable to all sources of damage available to you at this stage.'''''\n* ''Distract him (possible to fail, costing you a blood tithe anyway). Success rate depends on your [[Thieving]] level.''\n* ''\"Send me to the mines!\" (this option appears after you've found the [[Myreque hideout]]). You will not lose health, instead you will need to mine 15 [[Daeyalt ore]]s, place them in a minecart and then talk to a guard to leave. '''You'll then appear in the north-east part of the city.''' If you have no [[pickaxe]], a miner will supply one.''\n\n===The sickle logo agility course===\n[[File:Darkness of Hallowvale map.png|thumb|A map of Meiyerditch.]]\n[[File:Darkness of Hallowvale - navigating the ghetto.png|thumb|The rooftops of Meiyerditch.]]\n{{Needed|A [[knife]] or a [[sickle]] (knife can be acquired in the agility course)}}\n\nYou now need to make a complex journey across the city - watch for the sickle marks or simply follow the instructions below.

Tell him you've come to investigate and make contact with the Myreque, and he will give you a [[Message (Vertida)|message]] to take to [[Veliaf Hurtz]] back in [[Burgh de Rott]].\n\nTravel back to [[Burgh de Rott]] any way you see fit (see [[Darkness of Hallowvale#Details|above]] for options), and talk to Veliaf Hurtz in the basement of the pub again. '''Make sure you go through every chat option.''' He will tell you to talk to [[Drezel]] in the Temple of the Salve in [[Paterdomus]] (reach it via [[Fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|cks}} or [[Salve Graveyard teleport]] -- alternatively, you could do [[Temple Trekking]] to get there).\n\n===Urgent business===\n[[File:Darkness of Hallowvale - werewolves appear.png|thumb|The player is knocked unconscious by [[shadowy figure]]s.]]\n{{Needed|A knife or a sickle|recommended=Any pickaxe (the strongest you can wield) and three free spaces for mining Daeyalt ores}}\n\nGo to [[Drezel]] in [[Paterdomus]] and talk with him. He will say that strange noises have been heard outside the temple and asks you to investigate. Climb up the ladder in the west room and exit the Temple. To the west of Paterdomus, past the stairs, look for a [[Bush (Darkness of Hallowvale)|bush]] that is searchable. A short cut-scene will follow where you will be knocked out. You will see [[Shadowy figure|werewolves]] that seem to have managed to get across the [[River Salve]].\n\nReturn to Drezel, and tell him what you have just seen. He tells you to speak to [[King Roald]] and gives you [[runes]] for a [[Varrock Teleport]].\n\nGo to [[Varrock Castle]], and speak with King Roald, who is on the ground floor on the east side. You will engage in a long, fruitless conversation. Afterwards, a free teleport back to [[Paterdomus]] is offered by [[Aeonisig Raispher]]. However, you will have to return to [[Burgh de Rott]] instead. Speak to [[Veliaf Hurtz]] again.\n\nTravel once more with the boat you fixed to [[Meiyerditch]]. Head towards [[Vertida Sefalatis]] again, using the rooftop route described above or with the faster alternative method described below.\n[[File:Darkness of Hallowvale - route to lab.png|thumb|right|Path to the ladder.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable lighttable\"\n!Alternative route to Vertida Sefalatis\n|-\n|Speak to any [[Vyrewatch]] and ask to be sent to the mines.\n|-\n|Mine 15 [[Daeyalt ore]]s and place them in the minecart. ''If you have no pickaxe, talk to a miner to obtain a bronze one.''\n|-\n|Once the mine cart is full, talk to a guard to leave. You will appear up on the surface, north-east of the slums.\n|-\n|''See the map on the right side of this page.'' Follow the blue path to the first green dot.\n|-\n|From there, follow the old route; climb up the ladder, jump east to the floorboards, climb down the stairs, and go south-east through the hidden door.\n|-\n|Push the wall to the north and enter the trapdoor underneath the rug (south-east corner).\n|}\n\nOnce you're down the trapdoor, talk to Vertida Sefalatis. He will tell you to talk to [[Safalaan Hallow]], who is standing on a wall near the castle. Ask Vertida to lead the way, and he will take you to the south of [[Meiyerditch]].\n\n===Scoping Castle Drakan===\n{{Needed|4 free inventory spaces.|recommended=Armour and food if you cannot use [[Protect from Melee]].}}\n\nStarting from the south of Meiyerditch, reach [[Safalaan Hallow]] with the following steps;\n{| class=\"wikitable lighttable\"\n!'''Route to Safalaan Hallow'''\n|-\n|Climb down the ladder.\n|-\n|Head south and climb over the wall rubble where you first came into the city.\n|-\n|Head south climb up the floor to get on top of the wall.

There are sickle symbols on ground to tell you where to sketch, and he'll give you [[papyrus]] and [[charcoal]] to make the drawings with. '''''Note:''' You might not be able to see the sickle symbols if you have certain [[RuneLite]] textures enabled.''Travel to the back of the castle, going by the west path. Walk past the west sickle symbol, and then around to the north one and make [[Castle sketch 1|a drawing]] while standing on the sickle symbol. Go back to the west side of the castle and make the [[Castle sketch 2|second sketch]]. You will see a short cutscene, of [[Vanstrom Klause]] talking to Vanescula Drakan and Ranis Drakan. They will drink some fresh blood and then fly away.\n\n===Ambush!===\n[[File:Darkness of Hallowvale - Vanstrom knocks player out.gif|thumb|Vanstrom Klause knocks you out.]]\nGo to the south-eastern side of the castle (where you spoke to [[Safalaan]]), and attempt to make another drawing on the sickle symbol there. You will be interrupted, the drawing will not be completed, and [[Vanstrom Klause]] will attack you. You cannot damage him in any way, and it is possible to die here. Vanstrom only uses melee, so [[Protect from Melee]] will stop all damage. If you die on the fifth attack from Vanstrom, you will be teleported back to your grave and the cutscene will continue.{{fact|Confirmation needed. An elaboration may also be appropriate.}}\n\nAfter five attacks, you will be knocked out when Vanstrom is unable to kill you, and a cutscene will follow. When you recover, speak to Vanescula's servant, [[Sarius Guile]]. She gives you a long-winded hint about where to find a secret laboratory. '''Make sure to finish your final drawing.''' Your quest log should then read ''\"I have all three sketches of the castle. I need to take them to Safalaan\".''\n\n===The secret laboratory===\n{{Needed|Be on the [[normal spellbook]]. A knife or a sickle|recommended=Any pickaxe (the strongest you can wield) and three free spaces for mining Daeyalt ores}}\n\n[[File:Darkness of Hallowvale - route to fireplace.png|thumb|The route to the fireplace.]]\n[[File:Darkness of Hallowvale vampyre statue.png|thumb|A key [[vampyre statue]].]]\nReturn to the Myreque base in [[Meiyerditch]] via your prefered route, having a vyrewatch send you to the mine is the fastest. Just before you enter the base, head to the building with the fireplace just west of the rug entrance. If you lack a [[knife]], climb the ladder in the building with the fireplace and grab one off the table. Use the knife on the fireplace to discover a hidden [[Message (fireplace)|message]]. Using a sickle will cause it to say it's the wrong shape. Then use the knife on the [[Portrait (Darkness of Hallowvale)|portrait]] in the same room. If the message isn't found, attempting to cut the tapestry causes the message \"you see no reason to destroy this tapestry.\" Search the slashed portrait to get a [[large ornate key]]. Return to [[Vertida]], who is now accompanied by [[Safalaan]]. Give Safalaan the message you got from the fireplace and the three drawings of the castle. \n\nAfter speaking to Safalaan, leave the base. Go upstairs, jump west, go down the ladder, and exit the house on the northern side. Walk through the house north. Continue north-east staying near the eastern wall. You will find the house with a clearly visible large tapestry in one of the rooms, coloured red and yellow. Enter the house and use your knife on the tapestry, then walk through it. Use the large ornate key with the [[vampyre statue]] to open the secret laboratory entrance. '''Do NOT try to open the door by using the key on the door as this will inflict 10 damage.'''\n\nOpen the door, and go down the stairs. You may search the [[broken rune case]] to the west of the staircase for some [[runes]] (including [[Telekinetic Grab]] runes). Use Telekinetic Grab on the book [[Haemalchemy volume 1]] in the room.\n\n===Finishing up===\nLeave the room and take the book back to [[Safalaan]]. He will tell you to return to [[Veliaf Hurtz]] with a [[sealed message]]. You will now be able to use the shortcut doors on the path to the [[Myreque Hideout]]. However, this is not recommended due to this method being slower than being teleported to the mine.\n\nGet back to [[Burgh de Rott]] via any method, and talk to [[Veliaf Hurtz]] in the basement of the pub to finish the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Darkness of Hallowvale\n|image = [[File:Darkness of Hallowvale reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Agility|7,000}} [[Agility]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Thieving|6,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{SCP|Construction|2,000}} [[Construction]] experience\n*[[Tome of experience (Darkness of Hallowvale)|Tome of experience]], granting 2,000 experience to any three skills of the player's choosing (level 30 or over).

He tells you [[troll]]s have taken over the [[Death Plateau (location)|Death Plateau]] and are using it to launch nightly raids. However, they cannot reclaim the camp because the main path is heavily guarded by trolls. It has now become your job to find a different path to the Death Plateau. You also have to open the equipment storage room, which requires a combination code that was lost by the previous night's guard.\n\n===Harold the guard===\n'''''Items required: '''[[Asgarnian ale]], 60+ [[coins]], and a [[Blurberry special]] or [[Premade blurb' sp.]] (optional but recommended).''\n\n'''Talk to [[Eohric]]''' on the top floor of [[Burthorpe Castle]]. He will tell you that last night's guard, Harold, is at [[The Toad and Chicken]] pub in [[Burthorpe]]. '''Go to the pub south-east of the castle''', and head upstairs and to the west to find him. '''Try and speak to Harold''', but he doesn't want to talk about the combination.\n\n'''Go back and talk to Eohric'''. He will tell you that a beer and gambling may help to make Harold get over of his guilt.\n[[File:Death Plateau - Dice.png|thumb|right|Gambling dice with [[Harold]].]]\nBuy him an [[Asgarnian ale]], or get one from the table downstairs, and try talking to him again. This time, he will tell you he lost the [[combination]] and that he has searched for it everywhere without any success.\n\n'''Note:''' ''You can ask Harold if he would like another drink and hand over a [[Blurberry special]] or [[Premade blurb' sp.]], which makes Harold drunk and unable to count. This allows you to automatically win all the dice games as Harold believes you are using all four dice.''\n\nNow, ask him if he wants to gamble. Make sure you have a relatively large stack of coins; you have to continue winning the bets until Harold is out of money, and you may lose a few times. Keep trying to beat him until you get an [[IOU]] (you will only get an IOU betting in amounts between 60 and 1,000 coins). A somewhat safe method to empty his pockets is to start betting at 100 and then double your bet every loss while going back to 100 after every win. This effectively gives you four chances to win each 100 coin bet. Once you get the IOU, read it to find that the combination code to the storage room is on the back of the [[IOU]]! The [[IOU]] will vanish from your inventory and be replaced with the [[Combination]]. '''Note:''' '''You'll need it at the end but you can get a new IOU (or Combination, depending if you've completed the dialogue from reading the IOU) from Harold if you've lost it.

Go in and talk to [[Saba]]. Ask if he knows of another path to the Death Plateau. The guy has a very rude and grumpy demeanour that may put off anybody, but he hates [[troll]]s as much as those who disturb him, so he will negotiate with you. He proceeds to share with you a secret path from a certain [[Tenzing|Sherpa]]'s house, which leads directly to the Death Plateau.\n\nExit Saba's cave and continue heading west along the path until the path splits into a fork north and south. A wounded soldier marks the dangerous route towards the north. '''{{Colour|red|Warning}}:''' ''If you head north, a warning sign will tell you that Death Plateau is dangerous and you will be attacked by trolls. Do not go this way! Head back south-west.'' Follow the southern path and enter the house; inside you will find the Sherpa [[Tenzing]]. Talk to Tenzing and ask for his help. He will help you in return for 10 [[Loaf of bread|loaves of bread]], and 10 cooked [[trout]]. He will hand you some [[Climbing boots]]. {{Colour|red|Warning:}} If your inventory is full, the climbing boots will not go into your inventory and Tenzing may not sell you another pair.  \n\n'''Note:''' If you have lost your climbing boots, continue on with the quest, talk to Dunstan, then talk to Denulth to get the [[certificate]] to accept Dunstan's son into the Imperial troops, then talk to Dunstan again and your character will remark that you have lost the boots.

He tells you that he will make you the boots under one condition: His son should be made into an Imperial Guard. He also requires an [[iron bar]] to make the spiked boots.\n\nAfter talking to Dunstan, head back to the tent where you started the quest, and talk to [[Denulth]], and tell him that you have found a new path. However, it will only be revealed under the condition that the [[Tenzing|Sherpa]] has spiked boots and Dunstan's son be put into the Imperial Guard. Denulth makes an exception and gives you a [[certificate]] to accept Dunstan's son into the Imperial troops. Go back to Dunstan, and speak with him to hand over the iron bar and the certificate to receive a pair of [[spiked boots]].\n\n'''Note:''' If you already have a pair of spiked boots in your bank, Dunstan will not make you another pair and just say \"Sorry, I can't do anything with that\" when you try to give him an iron bar, he will also hint that you already own a pair.\n\n===Into the mountains===\n'''''Items required:''' 10 [[Bread|loaves of bread]], 10 [[Trout|cooked trout]], [[combination]], and Tenzing's [[Spiked boots|spiked climbing boots]].''\n\nGo back to [[Tenzing]] and give him his supplies.

Exit [[Tenzing]]'s house out the side door to his backyard and climb over the [[stile (Death Plateau)|stile]]. Take the path north and then continue following it east. Keep walking until you pass the second [[Mountain Goat]] and the rocks shortcut (don't try to climb the rocks). You may get a popup message saying that you'll be assailed by trolls if you continue while walking along the secret path. Ignore it, as the trolls will only attack if you're on the normal path. Just keep walking east until you get the message that it's safe to tell [[Denulth]] about the secret path. Return to [[Denulth]] with the [[Combination]] and [[Secret way map|secret map]] in your inventory to complete the quest.\n\n'''Note:''' ''If the [[Combination]] or the [[Secret way map]] were lost, they can be obtained from [[Harold]] or [[Tenzing]] respectively.''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Death Plateau\n|image = [[File:Death Plateau reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Attack|3,000}} [[Attack]] [[experience]]\n*[[Steel claws]]\n*The ability to make [[claws]]\n*Ability to purchase and wear [[climbing boots]] from [[Tenzing]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Death Plateau is required for the following:\n*[[Troll Stronghold]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n*[[Hermit]]\n*[[Tremble]]\n*[[Contest]]\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 8 August 2013\n|update = Patch Notes (8 August 2013)\n|change = Dunstan's dialogue has been adjusted to make it clear if you already have spiked boots in your bank during the Death Plateau quest.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Tenzing]] is an allusion to the Sherpa {{wp|Tenzing Norgay}}, who, along with the New Zealander {{wp|Sir Edmund Hillary}}, was the first to climb {{wp|Mount Everest}}.\n*When you open the door to Tenzing's house for the first time, he exclaims 'No milk today!

He will ask that you help him with a new play that is due to be performed at the villa, whose owner is a patron of the arts and is hosting a party for the play. He will ask that you acquire a [[butler's uniform]] to help him fit in; [[Adala]], Patzi's bag carrier, suggests \"borrowing\" one and tells you she recalls seeing some through a window in a villa to the north.\n\nThe villa in question is found just west of the [[Aldarin General Store]]. Break into the villa via the [[house window]] on the south side once the [[Wandering Guard]] is far enough, then take a uniform from the [[Wardrobe (Death on the Isle)|wardrobe]] nearby.\n\nReturn to Patzi, who will then ask that you follow along Adala to the staff entrance to blend in. Wear your uniform, then head south along the hedge until you see the [[Head Butler]]. He will inform you of the rules whilst inside the villa, and will hold onto your items before entering for security purposes.\n\n===Inside Villa Lucens===\n[[File:Death on the Isle - inside Villa Lucens.png|thumb|The player plays the part of a butler in Villa Lucens.]]\nOnce inside Villa Lucens, you will be wearing one of several possible masks ([[snake mask]], [[Ram mask|ram mask]], [[jaguar mask|jaguar mask]], [[Wolf mask (Death on the Isle)|wolf mask]] or [[bird mask]]) and [[butler's tray]] alongside your uniform. You will find Patzi by the eastern exit, who will tell you to introduce yourself to the guests on his behalf; however, as a butler, he will ask that you at least get their names for him.\n\nSpeak to [[Constantinius]], who you find out is the host of the party, and then the three guests: [[Cozyac]], [[Pavo]], and [[Xocotla]]. After doing so, you will relay what you've learned to Patzi, who then asks you to fetch him a glass of Principum Red in the [[wine cellar]]. Head outside and enter the [[cellar entrance]], then head all the way south to the wine cellar and investigate the lone [[antique wine]] there.\n\nAs you attempt to retrieve some wine from antique wine jug at south end of cellar, however, you will hear glass breaking in another part of the cellar, spilling some on you. Head to the south-east corner to find a fallen man. Upon investigating him, two guards, [[Stradius]] and [[Hutza]], will accuse you of murder and take you away to a small room in the villa. After some questioning, you offer to help solve the murder of [[Livius]], an actor who was due to perform on stage. They will give you a [[case file]] and ask you to investigate the crime scene.\n\n===Playing detective===\n[[File:Death on the Isle - dead man in cellar.png|thumb|Livius' corpose in the wine cellar.]]\nSpeak to Constantinius, Cozyac, Pavo, and Xocotla again, then return to the wine cellar and investigate the following:\n\n* [[Jug (Death on the Isle)|Jug]] by the stairs\n* [[Small box]] in south room\n* [[Broken stool]] in south room\n* [[Wine storage#Half full|Wine storage]] in east room\n* [[Broken pottery]] in east room\n* Livius' corpse\n\nAfter investigating everything, speak to Stradius and Hutza to discuss your findings. You will not find sufficient evidence to accuse the guests, but believe the butlers may be suspicious like you were, and will attempt to pickpocket them in hopes of finding something of note.\n\nPickpocket the following people for your investigation:\n\n* [[Cozyac]] - [[threatening note]]\n* [[Pavo]] - [[drinking flask]]\n* [[Xocotla]] - [[shipping contract]]\n* [[Adala]] - [[wine labels]]\n\n[[File:Death on the Isle - fighting Adala.png|thumb|Adala lashes out after being accused.]]\nAfter inspecting each item, return to the guards and they will gather everyone on the top floor. Speak to all the suspects, then place your accusations on Adala, who admits to being in the cellar to steal the extremely valuable [[Principum Red]]. However, she claims not to have killed Livius and starts attacking the player. She is level 49, and has no special mechanics to attack with. Once either of you are close to death, she will stop and claim that she's too weak to kill Livius or you depending on how the fight went. She will then be taken away.\n\n===The Show Must Go On===\nThough the killer is still at large, Constantinius demands that the show must go on, and asks that you keep an eye on the situation behind the scenes. He will tell you to use the back way around the theatre so as to not attract attention.\n\nUse the southern path down the steps that leads around the cliffs until you reach a set of [[loose rocks (Death on the Isle)|loose rocks]] by the [[File:Agility shortcut icon.png|link=]] shortcut icon. Navigate through them and speak to the guards - they will ask that you investigate the backstage downstairs to check for additional clues.\n\nEnter the [[backstage entrance]] then speak to the [[costumer]], and ask about the actors. Then search the following:\n\n* The [[crate (Death on the Isle)|crate]] next to the exit containing poison\n* The [[costume rack]] behind the mirror containing [[Naiatli|Naiatli's]] wine-stained costume\n* The [[bookshelf (Death on the Isle)|bookshelf]] hiding a secret passage to the wine cellar\n\n[[File:Death on the Isle - improv.png|thumb|The player confronts Naiatli without revealing to the audience what is truly happening.]]\nAfter searching the aforementioned objects, speak to the costumer and ask her about each of them. Next, return to the guards and accuse Naiatli of being the culprit. However, the play has started already, and you decide to step into the limelight.\n\nAs you accuse Naiatli of her crimes whilst doing so under the guise of improvising the play, you begin to attack her with a [[Prop sword (Death on the Isle)|prop sword]] while she continues to \"perform\". Whenever she runs away, resume attacking her until she \"dies\". You will find out that in reality, Naiatli only tripped him in an attempt to injure Livius so that he would be unable to perform the play, but was far too drunk and fell harder than anticipated.\n\nStradius and Hutza will thank you for your assistance and apologise for hastily accusing you, and the quest will be completed!\n\nBefore leaving Villa Lucens, players can claim some rewards:\n\n* Speak to the [[Head Butler]] in the kitchen to obtain the masks ([[Ram mask|ram]], [[Wolf mask (Death on the Isle)|wolf]], [[Bird mask|bird]], [[Jaguar mask|jaguar]], and [[Snake mask|snake]]) that you and the butlers wore during the quest, as well as the [[butler's tray]] you used.\n* Speak to the [[costumer]] for a [[costume needle]], which can be used for [[Crafting]] in place of a regular [[needle]], without needing any [[thread]].\n* Pickpocketing [[Constantinius]] for a [[Chest key (Death on the Isle)|chest key]], which is used to open the [[fancy chest]] in the wine cellar. This allows the fountain to the south-west of the villa to be searched for an [[Icon_(Aldarin)|icon]], which is then used to activate the statue on the North-East corner of the island. This drops one water rune on the ground and unlocks a teleport destination on a [[pendant of ates]].\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Death on the Isle\n|image = [[File:Death on the Isle reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards =\n* {{SCP|Thieving|10,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n* {{SCP|Agility|7,500}} [[Agility]] experience \n* {{SCP|Crafting|5,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n* A [[costume needle]] from the [[costumer]]\n* The [[butler's tray]] and an assortment of masks from the [[Head Butler]]\n* The ability to unlock the North [[Aldarin]] teleport destination via the [[pendant of ates]]\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\" style=\"text-align:left\">\nDeath on the Isle - Villa Lucens concept art.png|Concept art of Villa Lucens, by [[Mod Jerv]].\nDeath on the Isle - theatre and costume concept art.png|Concept art of the villa's theatre, by Mod Jerv.\nDeath on the Isle - main NPCs concept art.png|Concept art of the main cast, by Mod Jerv.\nDeath on the Isle - NPC concept art.png|Concept art of various quest NPCs, by Mod Jerv.\nDeath on the Isle - rewards concept art.png|Concept art of the animal masks and butler uniform, by Mod Jerv.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* The quest's name is a reference to Agatha Christie's 1937 detective novel ''{{WP|Death on the Nile}}''.\n* When first infiltrating the manor as a butler, [[Patzi]] will comment how amazing the player looks. If [[The Fremennik Isles]] quest has been completed, the player will reply \"''I feel like a court jester... and not for the first time either.''\".\n* When accusing [[Adala]], she responds, \"''And I probably would've got away with it too, if it wasn't for this precocious butler turned investigator you hired!''\". This line likely references the [[wikipedia:Scooby-Doo|Scooby-Doo!]] franchise, where villains often exclaim, \"''And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!''\" when caught.\n\n{{Death on the Isle}}"

(Note: You cannot have a pet following you before talking to Zanik.)\n\nZanik follows you around rather like a pet and tends to get stuck behind walls and doors but she will return to your side like any other pet.

This way you bypass the Cave Crawlers that if aggressive will poison you. Also bring plenty of food as the Wall Beasts deal on average 9 damage, with a max hit of 18.\n\n'''Warning: '''If you happen to slip on the stepping stones carrying a [[candle lantern]] it will break, leaving you stranded without a light source (apart from a [[candle]] itself after the lantern breaks, which is risky to use in the Swamp Caves). For safety precautions, bring any kind of quick teleportation if needed.\n\n[[Juna]] will ask you to gather blue tears from the waterfalls. Your hands must be empty for this. Once you talk to her with empty hands and you are holding the bowl, just click on the blue waterfalls as they spawn until you are at 20. A cutscene will begin and Zanik will be revived. Zanik tells you what she heard just before she died. Johanhus, Sigmund, the H.A.M. deacon, and a senior guard will talk about using a [[drilling machine]] at the Lumbridge water wheel, to cause the swamp caves to flood!\n\nTo complete the [[Tears of Guthix]] quest, after talking to [[Juna]] use the optional [[Sapphire lantern]] on a [[Light creature]] to be carried to the upper level of the south mine. There you can mine the [[Magic stone (Tears of Guthix)|Magic Stone]]; use a chisel on it to make the [[Stone bowl|Stone Bowl]] and return to Juna to complete Tears of Guthix.\n\n===Preparing for battle===\n'''''Items recommended''': H.A.M. outfit, Melee or Magic equipment ('''not''' Ranged) to deal with three level 22 guards and one level 50 boss, food and enough space to have both your hands empty.''\n\nGet back to Lumbridge (if you teleport Zanik will be in the Lumbridge cellar without her H.A.M. robes - this is not a problem, though you will need to retrieve her from the Lumbridge cellar before proceeding). Collect anything from the bank that you think you'll need for the fight. Then go to the chicken farm near the water mill with Zanik (across the river from Lumbridge Castle).\n\n\n'''Equip the full H.A.M. outfit''' then search one of the southern crates (the '''empty''' ones, not the ones with machine parts in them), Zanik will suggest she hides in it whilst you carry it, pick her up, and go down the trapdoor. You must have free hands (no weapon or offhand).\n\n'''Note:''' If you walk too far away from the trap door Zanik will leave the crate and suggest \"we get down there and save my city!\".\n\nAlso, immediately exiting the cave will make you unable to re-enter the trapdoor due to Zanik waiting for you in the cave. Logging out and back in will resolve this but you may have to return to the Lumbridge basement to have her follow you again.\n\n===The battle===\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Death to the Dorgeshuun - The Battle.png|thumb|200px|The fight. Try to line up the guards, with Sigmund at the back.]]\n[[File:Smashing the drill.png|thumb|left|The machine is smashed to smithereens.]]\nGo to the west room after climbing down the ladder of the nearby trapdoor. Sigmund, who is level 50, will appear, along with three level 22 [[Guard (Death to the Dorgeshuun)|H.A.M. Guards]]. Sigmund will use a protection [[prayer]] based on the attack you are using, so focus on his henchmen first.\n\n'''Note:''' By using the crates nearby, you are able to safespot using magic.\n\nAfter they're dead, Zanik will attack him with her crossbow. He will switch to [[Protect from Missiles]]. Attack him with melee or magic. At 1 HP, he will escape with a [[ring of life]]. Smash the drilling machine in the same location.\n\nGo down the southern tunnel and exit there; you'll find yourself back with the Dorgeshuun leaders. After the cutscene, the quest will be completed!\n\n'''Note:''' If you don't have a light source, Zanik will provide you one after the cut scene when going through the short cut.\n\n'''Note:''' You must return through the tunnel here. If you try to run back to the Lumbridge cellar entrance, the cutscene will not play.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Death to the Dorgeshuun\n|image = [[File:Death to the Dorgeshuun reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Thieving|2,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{SCP|Ranged|2,000}} [[Ranged]] experience\n[[File:Welcome to Dorgesh-Kaan.png|thumb|You are granted access to the Dorgeshuun city!]]\n*Access to the [[H.A.M.

He will tell you that one of the inn's patrons were raving that zombies have been organising in the [[Wilderness]], but were dismissed as the ramblings of someone who's had too much to drink. Believing there is more to the rambling, he will enlist your help in investigating the claims.\n\nFrom here, you must follow the trail, inspecting the correct objects along the way; you cannot skip ahead, as the \"Inspect\" option will not appear unless all previous objects have been inspected.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Tracking route\n!Steps\n!Map\n|-\n|1.

Look over the balcony to begin a cutscene showing [[Sharathteerk]], the second-in-command of the [[Mahjarrat]] [[Zemouregal]], and the now-undead [[Arrav]], a former hero of the [[Fourth Age]].\n\nSharathteerk will complain about being imbued with a [[red mist]], with Zemouregal saying the mist is required for the dungeon's security system. Sharathteerk will suggest allying with his cousin [[Lucien]], who you've met during the quest [[Temple of Ikov]], but Zemourgal rejects the idea, as he believes he would be serving under Lucien in such an arrangement. The two will then leave to inspect their troops. Elias will also leave, to inform the Varrockian authorities, leaving you to uncover more information within the dungeon. \n\nTo explore further, you will need [[Bottle of mist|bottles of red mist]] to bypass the dungeon's security. Each [[Gate (Defender of Varrock)|gate]] requires three bottles of mist to unlock, and each bottle will need to filled by killing an armoured zombie. Note that you will be unable to fill the bottles without watching the cutscene.\n\nZombies attack with either [[melee]] or [[ranged]] attacks, and the dungeon is multicombat. You can tell which attack style a zombie will use by looking at its weapon; a sword indicates melee. As there are more melee zombies, it is recommended to use [[Protect from Melee]]. After killing a zombie, click on the red mist they leave behind to fill a bottle. As the zombies have relatively low defence, a fast weapon such as a [[whip]] or a weapon with a [[Special attacks#Multi-hit|multi-hit special attack]], such as the [[dragon dagger]], are recommended. A [[salve amulet]] or its imbued versions is also beneficial as the zombies are undead creatures. \n[[File:Defender of Varrock - zombie army.png|thumb|300px|Zemouregal's zombie army, ready to attack Varrock.]]\nHead west and pick up three [[Bottle (Defender of Varrock)|bottles]] on the ground, then slay three zombies. After filling three bottles with [[red mist]], enter the gate to find yourself face-to-face with [[Arrav]], whose physical body is forcibly under Zemouregal's control, though he sometimes can speak of his own will when Zemouregal's concentration is elsewhere. He will tell you that Zemouregal controls him through possession of his heart.\n\nHead further north through the corridor and refill your bottles by killing three more zombies, and open the door to the east. Run further east to the end to find another balcony; look over it to begin another cutscene. Zemouregal will tell Sharathteerk that he has no time to worry about \"[[Stone of Jas|fairy tales]]\" that Lucien is supposedly close to finding, and will claim the planned invasion of Varrock is his last real chance before the time for the Mahjarrat's ritual arrives.\n\n'''Warning:''' Looking over the second balcony ends the instance of the dungeon. Ironman players looking to obtain the [[broken zombie axe]] might want to hold off on ending the instance, since the normal version of the dungeon is a popular multi-combat area.\n\n===The Sacred Forge===\n{{Needed|[[Barronite deposit]], [[chaos core]], [[pickaxe]], [[combat equipment]]|recommended=[[Mind Altar Teleport]], [[Varrock Teleport]]s}}\n[[File:Ramarno chathead.png|left|frameless]]\n[[File:Ramarno's Shard Exchange.png|thumb|300px|The Sacred Forge of Camdozaal, said to have been built when the city was established during the God Wars.]]\nHead to [[Varrock Palace]] and speak to Elias, just outside [[Sir Prysin|Sir Prysin's]] room, who has reported to [[Captain Rovin]] that an attack on Varrock is imminent. Elias will mention the [[Shield of Arrav]], which was once used to repel Zemouregal's first attempt at invading the city of [[Avarrocka]] in a tale known as [[The Legend of Arrav]]. Elias will add that the Shield was forged by the [[Imcando dwarves]], leading you to note that the [[Ruins of Camdozaal]] were recently rediscovered, and that [[Ramarno]] may be able to help.\n\nMake your way to [[Ruins of Camdozaal|Camdozaal]] and speak to [[Ramarno]] about the Shield of Arrav, and he will ask that you stoke the [[Sacred Forge]] with [[imbued barronite]]. As he is blind, you must be the one to gaze into the forge for answers.\n\nThe [[imbued barronite]] you must use is made by combining a [[chaos core]] with a [[barronite deposit]]. Chaos cores are dropped by [[Chaos Golem]]s in the eastern side of the ruins at a rate of 2/15, whilst barronite deposits are mined from [[barronite rocks]] on the western side at a rate of 6/25.  Note that when mining from the barronite rocks in the walls: [[Barronite deposit]] differs from [[barronite shards]]. Both can be received while mining but it is the deposits you will need to imbue on the chaos core. Use either item on the other to imbue the barronite, then use it on the Sacred Forge.\n\nWithin the Dream Theatre, you will speak to Arrav, who is temporarily free from Zemouregal's control. You will ask him how to use his shield, but he will tell you that its powers are unleashed by a person with the bloodline of the founder of Avarrocka, and that only his descendants can repel the Varrockian invasion. Suddenly, Zemouregal will appear in place of Arrav, fully aware of your interference, and tell you that his army has already begun laying siege to Varrock.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nFile:Defender of Varrock - Imcando Dream Theatre.png|The player speaks to Arrav in the Dream Theatre, free from Zemouregal's control.\nFile:Defender of Varrock - Zemouregal interferes.png|Zemouregal appears, aware of your interference.\n</gallery>\n\n===The True Descendant===\nReturn to Varrock Palace to find it under attack. Go two flights up the north-western staircase and speak to Elias and Captain Rovin, who will give you the [[Shield of arrav (item)|Shield of Arrav]]. Rovin will then tell you your best bet is to consult the [[Varrock Palace Library|library]] downstairs, so head to the palace library on the ground floor and speak to [[Reldo]], who will tell you about an old document he had with a list of elders who sent Arrav on his quest. Search the [[scrolls (Defender of Varrock)|scrolls]] by the flipped table in the north-east corner to obtain this [[List of elders|list]]. Read the [[Varrock Census]] north-west of the scrolls before leaving. If you happen to read the Varrock Census before searching the scrolls, you will need to destroy the list and read the census '''first'''. \n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nDefender of Varrock - Zemouregal at Varrock.png|Zemouregal at the northern wall of Varrock, with an army of zombies in tow.\nDefender of Varrock - zombie invasion.png|Armoured zombies lay siege to Varrock Palace!\nDefender of Varrock - Arrav leads the invasion.png|Arrav leading the invasion of Varrock against his will.\n</gallery>\n\nThere are six elders who were alive during Zemouregal's first invasion in the [[Fourth Age]], but only one is of the founding bloodline.

Visiting the other five descendants will result in each of them failing to activate the shield's true power, but only one of them (random for each player) will reveal that they are not a blood descendant of the family line, and explain that their great-grandfather was adopted in. They will then tell you that the last true descendant of their family was married into the Fitzharmon family.\n\nHead to south-east Varrock, past the gated area, and speak to [[Dimintheis]], who is of the noble family Fitzharmon. Upon equipping the shield, it will begin to crackle with lightning, indicating that he is indeed descended from the founder of Varrock.\n\nA cutscene will then play where you bring Dimintheis to Varrock Palace to unleash the shield's powers on the zombies throughout the area. With the second attempt a complete failure, Zemouregal, Sharathteerk will retreat, with Arrav in tow.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nDefender of Varrock - Dimintheis attacks.png|Dimintheis unleashes the shield's latent powers.\nDefender of Varrock - monk of Zamorak freed.png|The imprisoned monk, temporarily freed.\nDefender of Varrock - shield saves the Queen.png|The shield saves the Queen.\nDefender of Varrock - Zemouregal retreats.png|With the invasion a failure, Zemouregal is forced to retreat.\n</gallery>\n\nAfter the cutscene, finish the conversation with Elias and Captain Rovin to complete the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Defender of Varrock\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n* {{SCP|Smithing|15,000|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n* {{SCP|Hunter|15,000|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n* Access to [[Zemouregal's Base]]\n* [[Antique lamp]] rewarding 5,000 XP in any skill of at least level 30 and 5 [[Kudos]] from [[Historian Minas]] after completion of the quest\n}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name \n! class=\"unsortable\" |Unlock details \n! class=\"unsortable\" |Music track\n|-\n|[[Undead Army]] \n|Unlocked upon entering Zemouregal's Base\n|[[File:Undead Army.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[The Dream Theatre]] \n|Unlocked while speaking to Arrav in the Dream Theatre\n|[[File:The Dream Theatre.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Zombie Invasion]]\n|Unlocked upon entering [[Varrock Palace]] mid-invasion\n|[[File:Zombie Invasion.ogg]]\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Defender of Varrock is required for the following:\n*[[While Guthix Sleeps]]\n*[[The Curse of Arrav]]\n\n==Developers==\n'''Original'''\n* '''Developer:''' [[Paul Gower]]\n* '''Graphics:''' Mod Paul B, Mark C, Kavi M, Matthew S\n* '''Quality Assurance:''' Mod Chris L, Dan O'R, Dan G, Ben L\n* '''Audio:''' [[Mod Bond]], [[Chris Jolley]]\n* '''QuestHelp:''' Katie B\n\n==Historical==\nDefender of Varrock was [[rsw:Defender_of_Varrock|originally released in ''RuneScape'']] on [[29 September]] [[2008]], just over a year after the [[August 2007 Archive of RuneScape]] that ''Old School'' was built off of.\n\nJagex announced plans to backport the quest during the [[Winter Summit 2024|2024 Winter Summit]] alongside [[While Guthix Sleeps]], with some adjustments to bring it in line with Old School's standards as well as the overall story narrative of the game. The quests would be polled in the [[Poll:Winter Summit 2024 - Giga Poll|Winter Summit 2024 - Giga Poll]] and launched under a month later.\n\n===Differences from original version===\n* The original version had slightly different quest requirements:\n** Completion of [[The Knight's Sword]] was replaced with [[Below Ice Mountain]], as Camdozaal is properly accessible in ''Old School''.\n** 51 [[Agility]] and 59 [[Mining]] were originally requirements.\n** 51 [[Hunter]] and 54 [[Smithing]] were originally required, which were raised to 52 and 55 respectively in ''Old School''.\n* The experience rewards were slightly different:\n** 10,000 [[Smithing]] experience was rewarded, and was increased to 15,000 in ''Old School''.\n** 2,000 [[Agility]], 10,000 [[Mining]], and 10,000 [[Defence]] experience were originally rewarded.\n** Players were originally able to give Ramarno a [[redberry pie]] during or after the quest to receive 1,000 [[smithing]] experience. As players have already met Ramarno prior to this quest in ''Old School'', this optional reward is also removed, although the quest's standard Smithing experience reward is larger to compensate.\n* The music track [[The Dream Theatre]] was originally named simply ''Dream Theatre''.\n* New NPCs released with the quest received unique models in ''Old School''.\n** Zemouregal was originally larger and taller than other Mahjarrat, besides his cousin Lucien. In ''Old School'', he is roughly the same size and height instead.\n** Sharathteerk's ''Old School'' model is based on his 2014 ''RuneScape'' model, instead of his original 2008 model, or the 2005 model standard gargoyles use.\n** Arrav was originally larger than standard humans, but ''Old School'' redesigned him to use the standard human model. His ripped heart is also visible in his ''Old School'' design, something originally introduced in his 2015 redesign in ''RuneScape''. Additionally, he also originally used a large sword, which ''Old School'' replaced with a battleaxe for consistency with his statue in the [[Heroes' Guild]] and the display at the [[Outpost]].\n** Armoured zombies were redesigned despite originally being based on the 2007 zombie model in ''RuneScape''.\n* While largely faithful to the original, there are additionally minor changes to the quest and its narrative:\n** The quest was originally started by speaking to [[Captain Rovin]] in [[Varrock Palace]]. A scout working for him named {{RSL|Hartwin}} then accompanied you while investigating the zombie sightings. His role in helping you track down the zombies is replaced by Elias White in ''Old School'', who is based on (and is an anagram of) Ali the Wise, an NPC involved in the original quest's sequel, {{RSL|The Curse of Arrav}}. Hartwin is still named as a student in the Varrock Census, which is nine years out of date in the game's timeline.\n** The tracking section of the quest originally took place in the Wilderness, with the tracks leading from the [[Graveyard of Shadows]] to the entrance to [[Zemouregal's Base]] under the [[Chaos Temple (Wilderness)|Chaos Temple]]. After January 2011, this took place within an instanced version of the Wilderness without other players.\n** Zemouregal's Base was not instanced during the quest.\n** Compared to the original, Zemouregal's dialogue was expanded slightly to exposit more on [[Lucien]] and the [[Stone of Jas]]. When Arrav is first seen, the original also had a short cinematic showing the camera panning from Arrav's feet to his head.\n** Arrav's mention of his heart was absent in the original, as the quest's sequel, The Curse of Arrav, was released on 21 April 2009. In that quest, Ali the Wise helps steal Arrav's heart, which Elias White begins planning in Defender of Varrock.\n** In the original, Captain Rovin mentions after reporting back from Zemouregal's Base that it was the son of Avarrocka's founder who defeated the zombies after Arrav's defeat, but in the narrative of the quest, most people should have believed that it was Arrav who did so. This was corrected in ''Old School''.\n** The player originally visited [[Thurgo]] for guidance on the shield, where he then gives you a set of coordinates to the entrance of Camdozaal, which was significantly smaller than the Old School version. As the player already discovered Camdozaal during the events of [[Below Ice Mountain]], this section was skipped over.\n** The [[Sacred Forge]] is stoked with [[imbued barronite]] in order to speak with Arrav in the Dream Theatre without Zemouregal's influence. In ''RuneScape'', the forge is stoked with [[blurite ore]] instead, and is gazed into to gain information from the forge itself, where it presents the information through a vision of people the player has met in their adventures, specifically [[Wizard Traiborn]], [[Queen Ellamaria]], [[Lord Rologarth]], and the [[Wise Old Man]].\n** The copy of Varrock Palace during the invasion originally had less of the surrounding map visible, and Zemouregal, Sharathteerk and the armoured zombies could not be seen to the north. Several other minor changes were made to the sequence in ''Old School''\n*** A new NPC in Varrock Palace named {{RSL|Clive_(Varrock)|Clive}} was introduced with the original release of Defender of Varrock. Although he had no direct involvement in the quest, he could be seen cowering atop a bed during the invasion. Clive is absent entirely in ''Old School''.\n*** Originally, a [[warrior woman]] could be seen hiding behind an overturned table during the invasion.\n*** [[Queen Ellamaria]] originally had a line of guards protecting the entrance to her garden during the invasion.\n*** The player could originally try talking to [[Arrav]] during the invasion. In ''Old School'', he can instead be seen attacking guards. He was also originally combat level 180, as opposed to 292.\n*** A single guard could originally be seen still attacking one of the dummies on the palace roof during the invasion.\n** During the invasion, Reldo mentions that [[Surok Magis]] escaped. In ''RuneScape'', Surok escapes as part of the miniquest {{RSL|The Hunt for Surok}}.\n** {{RSL|Damar Leptoc}} is absent from the [[list of elders]], and as a result his descendants [[Juliet]] and [[Draul Leptoc]] are not involved in the quest. This is likely a result of ''RuneScape'' removing the Romeo and Juliet quest in September 2010, including the involvement of its characters in Defender of Varrock. In ''RuneScape'', to maintain there being seven elders, Damar Leptoc was replaced by the similarily Damar Lapucet, who had no descendants listed in the Varrock Census. Although Romeo was also removed, Laris Gontamue remained in the list of elders, and ''Old School'' restores Romeo's involvement in the quest. Additionally, the list has a slightly different icon than in ''RuneScape'', having yellow lines instead of grey ones.\n** Zemouregal's conversation with Sharathteerk at the end of the quest was rewritten slightly, compared to the original.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Defender of Varrock is the first post-2007 quest to be backported into ''Old School RuneScape'', and the first that was not originally present in the [[August 2007 Archive of RuneScape]].\n* After acquiring the Shield of Arrav, inspecting the display case for it in the [[Varrock Museum]] will cause the display to state \"''The Shield of Arrav has been temporarily removed for security reasons. So, if you are a hopeful marauding zombie, the museum exit is on the ground floor.''\"\n* When speaking to Elias, he mentions that he \"was an adventurer like you!\" To which the player replies by asking: \"What happened? Some sort of life-changing injury?\" This is a reference to the line \"I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow in the knee\", which is said by guards in the game ''{{WP|The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim}}''.\n* The surname of Romeo's ancestor Laris Gontamue is an anagram of Montague, the name of Romeo's family in William Shakespeare's play ''Romeo and Juliet''.\n*For those looking for the Broken Zombie Axe as a drop, the Armoured Zombies are in an instanced area prior to completion of the quest. Before peeking over the railing for the second time to look at the zombie army, players may farm the armoured zombies with the same drop table as the monsters after the quest.\n\n{{Defender of Varrock}}\n[[Category:Backported and extracted content]]"

Pay her one [[coin]], and she will tell you a story involving a [[demon]] named [[Delrith]] who terrorized Varrock over a century prior. Delrith was previously defeated by a hero named [[Wally]]; just your luck, the demon is being summoned again, and you now have to kill him with Wally's sword [[Silverlight]].\n\nAsk Aris, ''\"So, how did Wally kill the demon?\"'' She will show you the incantation Wally used: write down or screenshot the phrase, as it will be important later on. '''The word order of this spell is randomised for every player.''' After telling you the incantation, she tells you to talk to [[Sir Prysin]] to help.\n\nGo north to [[Varrock Palace]]. [[Sir Prysin]] will be wandering the south-west portion of the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} of the castle. Talk to him and tell him that Aris sent you. Ask for [[Silverlight]], the weapon needed to kill Delrith. He will say that he kept it hidden because of it being so powerful and it needs three keys to open it. He will tell you that he lost his key somewhere, and the other two keys are in the possession of [[Captain Rovin]] and the Wizard [[Traiborn]].\n\n===Captain Rovin's key===\n[[File:Captain Rovin chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nOne of the keys may be obtained by speaking to [[Captain Rovin]], who is found on the {{FloorNumber|uk=2}} of the [[Varrock Palace]], on the north-west side. Climb up the stairs in the north-west room twice in order to reach him.\n\nTalk to him and tell him that you need the key in order to recover [[Silverlight]] to slay a demon that threatens the city. Mention that Sir Prysin said Captain Rovin would give the key to you, to which he will rant about the King being the only one to tell him what to do. Next, ask him why Sir Prysin gave the key to him in the first place, and he'll state the King made Sir Prysin give him the key so that it wouldn't get lost. After this dialogue, he'll then hand over the key, under the condition that you do not allow Sir Prysin to kill the demon.\n\n[[File:Demon Slayer - Wizard Traiborn's wardrobe.gif|thumb|250px|Wizard Traiborn casts a spell to summon a wardrobe containing his key]]\n\n===Wizard Traiborn's key===\n{{Needed|25 unnoted [[bones]].}}\n[[File:Wizard Traiborn chathead.png|left|frameless|width=138x138]]\nHead to the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the [[Wizards' Tower]], which stands on an island south of [[Draynor Village]]. Talk to [[Traiborn]] about the key, to which he'll say he doesn't have it; ask about some keys knocking around, and Traiborn will explain that they're in a magical wardrobe, for which he needs 25 regular [[bones]] to open. \n\nYou can save time by having all of the bones with you when you first speak to him. An easy way to get the bones is to kill [[Goblin|goblins]] south of the prison outside of Draynor Village. Once you have all 25, give Traiborn the bones, and he will perform his ritual and then give you his key.\n\nNote for [[File:Ultimate ironman chat badge.png]] Ultimate Ironmen: You can deliver the bones in increments, so you do not need to clear out your inventory to complete this step.\n\nNote: if you die with Wizard Traiborn's key, you will have to pay another 25 bones to re-retrieve the key.\n\n===Sir Prysin's key===\n{{Needed|[[Bucket of water]].}}\n[[File:Sir Prysin chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nHead back to Varrock palace, and go into the kitchen in the north-east corner of the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}. If you do not already have a bucket of water, you can find an empty [[bucket]] up the stairs, in the bedroom to the north-east. With the bucket, return to the kitchen and use it on the sink (or any other water source, such as a fountain), to obtain a bucket of water.\n\nNext, head outside through kitchen door and look for a [[Drain (Demon Slayer)|drain]] near the wall north of the doorway. Use your bucket of water on the drain. '''If you do not do this, you cannot obtain the key'''. The key will be washed down the drain, so you must now retrieve it from the [[Varrock Sewers|sewer]] below. Head east, out of the palace, and look for a [[manhole]] located south of the palace's east walls. It is marked by the [[File:Dungeon icon.png]] icon on the [[minimap]]. Once you find it, open the manhole and climb down to enter the sewer.\n\n<!-- This doesn't use the regular map template because it cannot draw text labels; the GeoJSON used as an alternative is somewhat bloated, and therefore placed in mapspace and transcluded here-->{{Map:Demon Slayer key location}}{{clear}}\n\nWhile in the sewer, go north-west and follow the path highlighted on the map above until you reach a stream. You should see a muddy patch to your left, next to a pile of skeletons. Examine this and you will find a [[rusty key]].\n[[File:Silverlight detail.png|thumb|width=255x255|The mighty sword Silverlight.]]\n\n=== Silverlight ===\nNow that you have all three keys, head back to [[Sir Prysin]] in Varrock. Give him the keys, and he will give you [[Silverlight]]. Players can drop Silverlight and ask Sir Prysin for another one for free; after the quest he will charge {{Coins|500}}. Equip the sword, get any [[food]] and [[armour]] you may need for combat, and prepare to fight Delrith.\n\n''If you have forgotten the magical incantation, you can speak with Aris at her tent in Varrock Square to hear it again.''\n\nWhen you're ready, head south of [[Varrock]], and go east towards the stone circle surrounded by [[dark wizard]]s. A [[cutscene]] will play of [[Delrith]] being summoned by the wizards after you enter the circle.\n===Banishing Delrith===\n[[File:Demon Slayer - Summoning ritual.png|thumb|220px|The dark wizards attempt to summon Delrith!]]\n{{Needed|recommended=[[food]] and [[armour]].}}\n[[File:Dark wizard chathead.png|left|frameless]]\n[[File:Demon Slayer - Delrith is summoned.png|thumb|220px|Delrith is summoned!]]\n\nThe final part takes place in an [[instance]] of the [[Varrock]] [[stone circle]], with Delrith and several [[dark wizard]]s (two level 7 wizards and a level 20 wizard). Level 7 and 20 wizards will be [[aggressive]] to players with lower than 15 or 41 [[combat level]] respectively. Additionally, upon the cutscene finishing for the first time, one of the level 7 wizards will attack regardless of combat level. The level 20 wizard's maximum hit of 6 can threaten players with a low [[Hitpoints]] level, especially if the player has negative [[Magic Defence]] bonus. '''To leave, run to the edge at any time during the fight.'''\n\nBecause the fight takes place in a [[single-way combat]] zone, if you are already under attack from a dark wizard, you will need to kill or hide from it before you are able to begin combat with Delrith. It is recommended for lower-level players to approach from the south, and hide from wizards behind the southernmost stone wall until Delrith is nearby. Since the wizards '''do not respawn''' in the instance, it is also possible to kill them first, leave and restock, and then return to face Delrith.\n\nAttack Delrith with Silverlight equipped. Despite his combat level of 27, the Silverlight's weakening effect will reduce Delrith's hitpoints to less than that of a [[cow]]. When he reaches 0 hitpoints, say the magical incantation. If the wrong incantation is said, Delrith regenerates to full health. \n\n==== Pures and lower levels ====\nFor those wishing to attack with magic, wielding Silverlight and manually casting spells will also deal damage. Other methods include [[flinch|flinching]] him or using [[Confuse]], [[Curse]], or [[Weaken]] to make him easier to kill with melee. [[Ring of recoil]]s can be used for this fight. <!-- is combat xp normal? -->\n\nIf you take too long<!-- how long? --> to finish off [[Delrith]], he will disappear and you will need to leave and re-enter the instance. If Delrith disappears during the dialogue to banish him the quest can still be completed by pressing \"continue\" until the end.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Demon Slayer\n|image = [[File:Demon Slayer reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 3\n|rewards =\n*[[Silverlight]] (if lost, players may retrieve it from [[Sir Prysin]] for a fee of 500 [[coins]].)\n*5 [[Kudos]], which [[members]] can claim by talking to [[Historian Minas]] in the [[Varrock Museum]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Demon Slayer is required for the following:\n*[[Recipe for Disaster/Freeing the Lumbridge Guide]]\n*[[Shadow of the Storm]]\n*[[Defender of Varrock]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 29 November 2018\n|update = Spellbook Filters and Bounty Hunter Changes\n|change = Silverlight obtained at the beginning of Shadow of the Storm can no longer be used to complete the quest.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}} \n\n==Trivia==\n*While speaking to Captain Rovin to obtain his key, your character will state what happened to Sir Prysin's key even if your character has not yet asked Sir Prysin for it.\n\n{{Demon Slayer}}"

Select chat options 2 and 1 to agree to help him, and he will ask you to begin by talking to his family and servants.\n\nSpeak to [[Chef Olivia]] in the kitchen. Olivia reveals that she and Artur are lovers, that he told her he was looking for the original copy of the [[Accord of Twill]], and that he has been spending a lot of time researching in the [[Arceuus Library]]. She refers you to a librarian, [[Galana]], who might be able to help you.\n\n===The Envoy to Varlamore===\nTravel north to the [[Arceuus Library]] which can be found next to Tower of Magic.  '''Tip''': a fairy ring can be found nearby (code: {{Fairycode|CIS}}). \n\nSpeak to [[Galana]], who is found in the north-eastern segment on the ground floor. She will suggest you find a book called [[Varlamore envoy]], the location of which is random for each player. Ask her where it is and search the bookcases in that area until you find it—each square in game is its own bookshelf, so be thorough. \n\n'''Note:''' If you log out before finding the book, make sure to speak to [[Galana]] again, as the location may have changed.\n\nRead the book, and you will discover that the original copy of the Accord was lost at sea, and that the ship carrying it sunk into the [[Crabclaw Caves]], whose entrance is found south of the [[Woodcutting Guild]], marked with the [[File:Dungeon map link icon.png]] icon. (If you don't read the book, a message saying \"You have no reason to go in there.\" will appear in the chat when you try to enter the Crabclaw Caves.)

He believes the chest further ahead contains the original Accord, but it is guarded by a [[Sand Snake]]. As he is not good at fighting, he asks you to kill it for him. Climb the rocks ahead, and kill the Sand Snake. It is weak to [[magic]], so magical attacks are recommended to kill it quickly.

[[Pures]] wishing to avoid gaining [[Hitpoints]] experience should note that all of the bosses may be defeated with the help of a [[Dwarf multicannon|cannon]], but should be prepared to use 500 or more [[Cannonball|cannonballs]] due to the high amount of combat throughout the quest. See the \"notes for pures\" section under each boss for more information.\n\n==== Stranger Danger ====\nBefore starting, note that if you're carrying one or more of the [[Diamonds of Azzanadra]], you may be attacked by a level 95 [[Stranger]] who appears next to you and carries a [[poison]]ed [[dragon dagger]]. This is random and does not happen to everyone, but can happen at any point where the diamonds are in your inventory.\n\nTo be safe, players may want to carry a [[teleport]] and [[antipoison]] when moving the diamonds, and ensure having some spare [[prayer point]]s until the quest is completed. Players can flee from him when he appears, and simply banking the diamonds will prevent him from appearing further, but players should be warned that he can strike almost immediately after the diamonds are received from their respective bosses.\n\n[[Ultimate ironmen]] can deposit each diamond into the pyramid as they acquire them so as not to risk attack; see the [[Desert Treasure I#The Ancient Pyramid|Ancient Pyramid section]] below for more information.\n\n==Walkthrough==\n[[File:Kharidian Desert map.png|thumb|300px|The [[Kharidian Desert]] – Desert Treasure starts in [[Bedabin Camp]].]]\n===Enchanting the mirrors===\n{{Needed|Two [[Shantay pass (item)|Shantay pass]]es (or another method of entering the [[Kharidian Desert]]), 650 [[coins]], [[blood rune]], [[ashes]], [[bones]], [[charcoal]], 6 [[molten glass]] (noted works), 12 [[magic logs]] (noted works), 6 [[steel bar]]s (noted works)|recommended=[[Waterskin]]s, [[desert clothing]], coins for [[magic carpet]] rides (bring a [[ring of charos (a)]] for discounted rides), teleportation methods to the [[Exam Centre]] ([[digsite pendant]], [[Varrock]] teleport) and [[Al Kharid]] ([[ring of dueling]], [[amulet of glory]]).}}\n\nTravel through the [[Shantay Pass]] south of [[Al Kharid]], and then west via flying carpet or by running to the [[Bedabin Camp]]. [[Fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|BIQ}}, near the [[Kalphite Lair]], is north-east of the camp. Talk to [[Asgarnia Smith]] near the small water pool, and he'll give you some [[etchings]] to bring to [[Terry Balando]], the archaeological expert, at the [[Digsite]] [[Exam Centre]].\n\nGo to the Digsite, east of [[Varrock]], and talk to Terry in the Exam Centre, who will take the etchings. Talk to him again to receive the [[translation]] to take back to Asgarnia Smith.\n\nGo back to Asgarnia Smith in the desert. When talking to him, choose the ''Don't read book'' option. Talk to him again and agree to help.\n\nGo south to the [[Bandit Camp (Kharidian Desert)|Bandit Camp]]. ''Before entering the camp, remove any equipment that depicts [[Saradomin]] or [[Zamorak]] imagery, otherwise the bandits will be aggressive''. Talk to the [[Bartender (The Big Heist Lodge)|bartender]] and buy a [[Bandit's brew|drink]] for 650 [[coins]]. Talk to him again to find out about the four [[Diamonds of Azzanadra]]. '''This step must be completed before talking to Eblis otherwise the option to talk with him about the diamonds won't appear.'''\n\nTalk to [[Eblis]] in a nearby building to the east, past the [[general store]]. Ask him about the diamonds, and he'll tell you that he needs various items to create some scrying glasses:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Item\n!GE Price\n!Notes and ironman concerns\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Magic logs}} x 12\n|{{Coins|{{GEP|Magic logs|12}}}}\n|There are many ways to obtain magic logs:\n\n* Cutting a magic tree (75 {{SCP|Woodcutting}}, boostable)\n* Looting [[Nature Impling|Nature Implings]] (58 {{SCP|Hunter}}, boostable)\n* Opening supply crates from [[Wintertodt]]\n* Looting the [[Brimstone chest|Brimstone Chest]]\n* Defeating various [[Revenants]]\n* Completing [[Hunters' Rumours]]\n* Opening Larran's [[Larran's big chest|big]] or [[Larran's small chest|small]] chests, using [[Larran's keys]] obtained through [[Wilderness Slayer]]\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Molten glass}} x 6\n|{{Coins|{{GEP|Molten glass|6}}}}\n|Can be made at 1 {{SCP|Crafting}}\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Steel bar}} x 6\n|{{Coins|{{GEP|Steel bar|6}}}}\n|Requires 30 {{SCP|Smithing}}, or [[Steel bar#Spawns|dropped by various monsters]]\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Ashes}} x 1\n|{{Coins|{{GEP|Ashes|1}}}}\n|Can be obtained from any [[fire]]\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Blood rune}} x 1\n|{{Coins|{{GEP|Blood rune|1}}}}\n|4 spawn in the [[Wilderness]]\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Bones}}x 1\n|{{Coins|{{GEP|Bones|1}}}}\n|See all bone spawn locations [[Bones|here]]\n|-\n|{{plinkp|Charcoal}}x 1\n|{{Coins|{{GEP|Charcoal|1}}}}\n|See all charcoal spawn locations [[Charcoal|here]]\n|-\n|Total:\n|{{Coins|{{GEP|Magic logs|12}}+{{GEP|Molten glass|6}}+{{GEP|Steel bar|6}}+{{GEP|Ashes|1}}+{{GEP|Blood rune|1}}+{{GEP|Bones|1}}+{{GEP|Charcoal|1}}}}\n|''It's possible for level three ironmen to obtain all items''\n|}\n[[File:Desert Treasure mirrors.png|thumb|right|The mirrors, made by [[Eblis]].]]\n{{Colour|Red|Wearing a Zamorak item when giving Eblis the items will cause Eblis to not create the scrying glasses!}}\n\nBring Eblis the items required. Make sure to '''use''' the bones on him instead of burying them, noting them will avoid this.\n\nAfter giving him the items, Eblis will have travelled south-east on top of a hill (shown as a grey circle on the minimap), surrounded by six mirrors. Looking into them will show locations related to the diamonds, though it is not required.\n\nTalk to Eblis again and he'll explain that his spell only makes the mirrors reveal where the diamonds have been at one point in time. Two of the mirrors show other locations entirely; the [[Bedabin Camp]], which you visited, and the [[Ancient Pyramid]] itself, which you need to acquire the diamonds in order to enter.\n\n'''Diamonds can be acquired in any order. The order below is sorted from easiest to hardest.'''\n\n==Smoke diamond==\n{{Needed|[[Shantay pass (item)|Shantay pass]]es, [[waterskins]], a [[tinderbox]]; a gas mask, face mask, or slayer helmet; two or more [[Energy potion]]s or a [[stamina potion]], [[ice gloves]] or [[water spell]] [[runes]] (staves do not work without [[ice gloves]]), [[prayer potion]]s, a [[weapon]] (only if wearing [[ice gloves]]; otherwise your weapon will be unequipped), [[armour]] (Magic-defence armour or armour with [[Prayer bonus]]), [[food]], and an emergency teleport.}}[[Fareed]] is widely considered the easiest boss of the quest, due to the fact that he uses [[melee]] almost exclusively. Keep the following in mind during this section:\n\n* Those coming directly from the [[ice diamond]] section must restore their [[Firemaking]], as the [[Standing Torch (Smoke Dungeon)|torches]] require at least level 50 Firemaking to light.\n* A [[facemask]], [[slayer helmet]], or a [[gas mask]] '''must''' be worn at all times while in the dungeon, or the player will be hit for 20 damage every 12 seconds. While this smoke effect won't kill you (it will never damage you below 1 hitpoint), various monsters can still deal damage, posing a significant risk for low-level players should they accidentally enter combat.\n{{Map|name=Smoke Dungeon|x=3310|y=2962|r=4|mtype=square|align=right|caption=The [[Smoke Dungeon]] is located west of [[Pollnivneach]].|width=250|height=250}}\n\n===With gate responsibility===\n[[File:Smoke Dungeon map.png|center|thumb|500px|A map of the [[Smoke Dungeon|dungeon]].]]\n\nTake all of the items listed above and travel to the [[Smoke Dungeon]]. The dungeon entrance is marked on the world map; hug the cliffs on the west side of [[Pollnivneach]], and head south to find it. Climb down the well, and if it stops you with a warning about the air inside, just try to climb down again. \n\nIn each of the four corners of the dungeon are [[Standing Torch (Smoke Dungeon)|standing torches]] that you need to light using your [[tinderbox]]. '''The torches will burn out if you take too long;''' if you walk instead of run, the first lamp will have burnt out by the time you reach the [[burnt chest]]. As such, it is recommended to use [[energy potion]]s or [[stamina potion]]s to maintain run energy.\n\nWhile the torches can be lit in any order, it's recommended to start with the north-eastern torch, as it's the farthest from the chest. From there, the torches can be lit in under two minutes if running to the south-eastern torch second, the north-western torch third, and finishing at the southwest torch, allowing you to quickly run to the chest. \n\nWhen all four are lit, go to the centre of the dungeon and open the burnt chest to obtain the [[warm key]]. ''If the key is lost before being used to unlock the gate, it can be reobtained from the chest without needing to relight the torches.''\n\n===Facing Fareed===\nMake your way to the east part of the dungeon and use the key on the gate to begin the fight with [[Fareed]].\n\n''If you leave the fight before killing Fareed, you will '''NOT''' need to get the Warm Key again.''[[File:Desert Treasure torch.png|thumb|The torch the player needs to light.]]\n\n====The fight====\n[[File:Fighting Fareed.png|thumb|right|A player fighting [[Fareed]].]]\n\n* Despite his simplicity, [[Fareed]] should not be underestimated. His main attack is a melee hit that can deal up to 40 damage (or 36 with ice gloves). [[Protect from Melee]] negates all damage from his melee attack; those with low [[Hitpoints]] who do not have 43 [[Prayer]] should ensure they are not in melee range.\n*Fareed also has a [[Magic]] attack, but it can only be cast in melee distance. While it's very uncommon for him to use the attack, it can still hit in the 20's, so [[Armour/Magic armour|Magic defence]] is recommended to supplement melee protection prayers.\n*If the player doesn't have [[ice gloves]] equipped, Fareed will repeatedly remove the player's weapon to their [[inventory]]. This makes melee impossible for those without the gloves; combined with his high melee defence, and his ability to hit with magic while in melee range, melee is not recommended when fighting him.\n*'''Magic is the most effective attack style''', as Fareed is very weak to [[water spells]]. Mages should note that any other spell type will '''not''' work against him, including [[God spells]] and the [[trident of the seas]] and [[Trident of the swamp|swamp]]. Players can bypass the need for ice gloves by manually casting spells from their spellbook.\n*Range is also fairly effective; although as before, ice gloves are required to wield a bow around him when in melee distance. It may be advisible to use cheap ammunition on Fareed, as any ammunition used besides [[ice arrows]] will drop beneath him as [[ashes]], bypassing the ammo-saving effect of [[Ava's accumulator]] and [[Ava's assembler]].\n*[[Bind]], [[snare]], or [[entangle]] can be used to stop him from moving, though moving too far out of range will cause him to despawn. Using the technique of binding him and running away (known as [[kiting]]), players can avoid the need for prayer or ice gloves by preventing him from ever getting in melee distance.\n*Fareed can also be trapped and safespotted behind another player. The [[dwarf multicannon]] works in the dungeon.\n\nUpon defeating Fareed, the [[Smoke diamond]] will appear in your inventory. If lost, it will reappear in the chamber on the ground when the player walks through the gate. Fareed will not have to be fought again.\n\n==Shadow diamond==\n{{Needed|[[Shantay pass (item)|Shantay pass]]es, [[waterskin]]s, 20&mdash;50+ [[lockpick]]s, noted lockpicks and 5 [[coins]] per to exchange at [[Tiles]]|recommended=Teleportation method to [[Rasolo]] ([[skills necklace]] to teleport to the [[Fishing Guild]] or [[Barbarian Assault]] [[grouping teleport]]), teleport method to [[Al Kharid]] ([[amulet of glory]] or [[ring of dueling]]), multiple [[antipoison]], [[super restore]] if using melee, [[food]]. Additional noted supplies may be preferable.}}\n\nDamis is similar to Fareed in that he uses melee and can be easily safespotted. While the fight is fairly straightforward, his section is one of the longest, so keep the following in mind to avoid multiple trips, and ensure a successful fight:\n\n\n\n*[[Rasolo]] '''must''' be spoken to before the chest can be [[Lockpick|picked]] open.\n*There is a large amount of running for this section, making stamina or restore potions beneficial.\n* Contrary to popular belief, Damis is not particularly weak to earth spells.\n\n===Giving a ring===\n[[File:Desert Treasure Rasolo.png|thumb|Talking to Rasolo in the location shown by the mirror.]]\nTravel west of the [[Fishing Guild]] to the entrance of the [[Tourist Information Centre]]. Just east of the Tourist Information Centre lies a fenced area, with a wandering man named [[Rasolo]] nearby. Talk to Rasolo, asking about the diamonds, and he'll offer to give you a [[ring of visibility]] in exchange for a [[gilded cross]].\n\n[[File:Desert Treasure chest.png|thumb|The chest the player needs to open.]]\nTake some [[food]], [[lockpick]]s and [[antipoison]] to the [[Bandit Camp (Kharidian Desert)|Bandit Camp]]; for ironmen, note that both lockpicks and antipoisons may be pickpocketed from the [[Bandit (Bandit Camp)|Bandits]] in the vicinity. In the southern-most tent in the Bandit Camp is a [[secure chest]], requiring 53 [[Thieving]] to open. Use lockpicks on it until all 3 locks bypassed, and the chest is opened; then, search the open chest to receive the gilded cross and 150 Thieving [[experience]]. \n\nThis section is straightforward, but many players find this section to be tedious and require many tries. If a player fails to open any of the locks, all of the previous locks are reset, and the player's lockpick will break. Each failed attempt will deal 2&mdash;3 damage, as well as have a chance to apply [[poison]] to the player if not protected. For those who find themselves running out of food or lockpicks, the nearby [[Tiles]] will un-note additional supplies 5 coins each, allowing players to bring larger stacks of items.\n\nIf the cross is lost, search the chest again to receive a new one; it does not need to be re-picked.\n\n===Defeating Damis===\n{{Needed|[[Gilded cross]]|recommended=Combat equipment, [[prayer potion]]s, [[runes]] to cast spells such as [[Entangle]], [[stamina potion]]s, and an emergency teleport.}}\n\n{|\n|colspan=2|[[File:Shadow Dungeon map.png|center|thumb|500px|[[Shadow Dungeon]]]]\n|-\n|1. Entrance east of [[Baxtorian Falls]] with [[ring of visibility]]||G – [[Giant skeleton (Shadow Dungeon)|Giant skeletons]] ''(level 80)''\n|-\n|2. [[Damis]]||S – [[Shadow hound]]s ''(level 63)''\n|}\n\nReturn to Rasolo and exchange the gilded cross for the [[ring of visibility]]. Equip the ring, and a ladder will appear to the east of Rasolo in the fenced area. Climb down the ladder, then head east as far as you can, then north as far as you can. Head east again, and go south as far as possible at the first fork. Go east again. After this, take the next turn north, then go east, and you will reach [[Damis]]' cave. Beware that the area where Damis is encountered is a [[multi-combat area]], filled with [[Giant skeleton (Shadow Dungeon)|giant skeletons]] and [[shadow hound]]s . These monsters solely use melee, so activating [[Protect from Melee]] will negate all damage.\n\nOnce Damis' cave is reached, it's time for the fight. If he does not spawn, players can make Damis appear by running around a bit in the final area. You must have the ring of visibility equipped or he will not appear; make sure to '''keep the ring equipped for the entire fight'''. \n\n'''Note:''' It is possible for Damis to not appear right away. Un-equipping and re-equipping the ring of visibility may help, as well as walking around the arena close to the walls. If he still doesn't appear, hopping worlds should work. \n\nIf you teleport out after defeating him without picking up the diamond, it will remain on the ground and you can come back to pick it up, without having to fight him again. Additionally, players may find it beneficial to kill a shadow hound while in the dungeon, to complete a task for the [[Hard Kandarin Diary]].\n\n====The fight====\n[[File:Fighting Damis.png|thumb|A player fights [[Damis]].]]\n* Damis has two forms. The first is level 103 which only attacks with [[Melee]], and the second form is level 174 and rapidly drains [[Prayer]] when attacking you. The second form is significantly harder, and has an attack speed of 3, as well as being able to hit up to 28 while draining 5% + 1 of your current Prayer points every [[tick]] (0.6 seconds).\n** At 43 prayer, this attack will drain 3 prayer points every tick. Combined with normal rate of prayer drain, this means that players will lose 16 points every three seconds.\n** This prayer drain only triggers when Damis is in melee distance; safespotting him allows players to ignore this mechanic completely.\n** With Protect from Melee, [[Damis]] is not much more difficult than any other monster, although you'll need to ensure you have enough prayer potions to account for his prayer drain. Make sure to watch your prayer points so that you don't run out.\n* The most common way of defeating Damis is with magic. While it is possible to use Melee, his Melee defence is very high, on top of subjecting players to the prayer drain.\n* Damis is not particularly weak to earth spells;{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1028980496020242432|date=13 August 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/9U1cP|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=The ice & fire warriors have effects. So do mummies in the pyramid. That's all I could find.}} any spell will suffice. You can use a [[trident of the seas]] for both forms.\n* Unless safespotting, you will rely heavily on [[Protect from Melee]], as without it activated, you'll be tanking 2-4 [[Giant skeleton (Shadow Dungeon)|giant skeletons]] and [[shadow hound]]s while trying to kill [[Damis]], all of whom attack accurately with Melee.\n* Without Protect from Melee, prepare to take large amounts of damage '''very''' quickly. To simply tank Damis without using prayer potions, it is recommended to have level 65 to 70 melee stats at minimum, a [[divine super combat potion]], and a full inventory of high-healing food ([[Cooked karambwan|karambwan]] or better). Poisoning Damis is also helpful.\n* If you leave after defeating his first form, you do not have to fight it again! When you return, you will only have to defeat his second form, allowing players to re-supply if necessary.\n* Bringing a [[stamina potion]] and kiting him around the arena will help reduce the burden of using [[prayer potion]]s. Casting [[Snare]]/[[Entangle]] on [[Damis]] and re-casting once he moves can help keep him from ever coming within Melee distance.[[File:Desert treasure safespot.png|thumb|220px|A player uses a [[giant rat]] to [[Safespot]] [[Damis]].]]\n\n====Notes for pures====\n* If you plan to use the [[Safespot]], lure his first form there, as otherwise, his second form will just disappear into the shadows.\n* The safespot is easy to set up: as soon as Damis spawns, head to the safespot, using the torches to your advantage.\n* Due to the dungeon being multicombat, you can use other creatures such as the giant rat and the [[bat]] found in the south-west corner of the arena from which you entered as blockers. To do so, simply position yourself behind the animal and attack it with a weak attack or spell, then attack Damis with Magic. Consider bringing a fun weapon such as flowers to draw the creatures' attention without killing it.\n* You can also poison Damis, and then use the safespotting method to let the poison lower his health; he rarely despawns.\n* Cannons can be set up in this area. For those without access to prayer, the south-eastern-most area of the dungeon is just wide enough to fit a cannon, but narrow enough to trap Damis while setting it up.\n\nOnce you have defeated Damis in his second form, he will drop the shadow diamond on the ground. Once the diamond is in players' inventories, they can safely teleport out of the dungeon. If the diamond is lost, simply crossing the corridor into the multi-combat zone, the area where Damis spawns, will make the diamond reappear on the ground.\n\n==Blood diamond==\n{{Needed|[[Garlic powder]] (created by using your [[pestle and mortar]] with [[garlic]]), [[silver bar]], [[spice]].|recommended=Good food ([[swordfish]] or better), 1-2 [[prayer potion]]s, [[Druid pouch|druid pouches]], and a [[Draynor Village|Draynor]] teleport method.}}\n\n[[Dessous]] is a fairly straightforward boss, but due to his location, forgetting steps can cost a lot of time. Keep the following in mind:\n\n* The pot cannot be made ahead of time,  you need to get instructions from [[Malak]] first.\n* Save gearing up until after you get the [[Silver pot (Desert Treasure I)|silver pot]], as you'll need to go to [[Entrana]] to get it blessed, and combat items aren't allowed on the island.\n* If you plan on using the [[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton]] [[Grouping|minigame teleport]] and [[Swamp Boaty|the Hollows boat]], make sure to bring 10 coins or a [[Ring of charos(a)]] for the ride.\n\n===Sweetening the pot===\n[[File:Desert Treasure talking to Malak.png|thumb|Malak notices your presence whilst collecting blood tithes.]]\nTravel to [[Canifis]] ([[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|cks}}), and talk to [[Malak]] in the pub. Tell him that you're looking for a diamond. He'll agree to give it to you if you kill Dessous and gives you a list of items that you'll need to kill him successfully. '''Make sure to ask [[Malak]] how to kill [[Dessous]] before you go to [[Ruantun]] or he won't make the silver pot for you.''' Travel to [[Draynor]], there is [[garlic]] in the cupboard upstairs in [[Morgan]]'s house if you need it. Bring your [[silver bar]] down the trapdoor, west of Morgan's house, to enter [[Draynor Sewers]]. In the sewers, go east, then north and talk to [[Ruantun]]. Ask him to make you a [[Silver pot (Desert Treasure I)|silver pot]]. \n\nTake the pot to [[Entrana]] (making sure you have no [[weapons]]/[[armour]] on you; there's a deposit box at the ship that can be used to bank before embarking), and head to the church, then use the silver pot on the [[High Priest (Entrana)|High Priest]] to get it blessed. Go back to Canifis, and talk to Malak again, and he'll fill the pot with your blood (this will damage you for 5 [[Hitpoints]], but '''cannot''' kill you). Finally, add the [[garlic powder]] to the pot along with some [[spice]] to prepare for the battle. The [[High Priest (Entrana)|High Priest]] will still bless a silver pot filled with blood, though he will be slightly shocked, if the instructions are done out of order.\n\nThe examine for the pot should read: ''A blessed silver pot filled with blood, garlic and spices.'' \n\n'''If the examine does not say this and you attempt to kill Dessous, he will regenerate to full Hitpoints, and you will need to refill the pot.'''\n[[File:Graveyard_Map.png|thumb|434x434px|Reaching [[Dessous]] in the [[Morytania Graveyard]].]]\n\n===Dealing with Dessous===\nOnce the pot is prepared, gear up and go to the [[Morytania Graveyard]] - see [[Dessous]]'s page for routes there. Once you arrive, pour the blood on the tomb and Dessous will appear.\n\n====The fight====\n*Dessous is a [[Vampyre (monster type)#Tier 1 Vampyres|tier 1 vampyre]], meaning that [[silver weaponry]] is '''not''' required to damage him, though they do gain a 10% damage bonus. The [[Ivandis flail]] and [[blisterwood flail]] give greater bonuses, but Dessous's weakness to [[Stab weapons|stab]] means a stab weapon such as a [[dragon sword]] is a better option if using melee.\n*[[Efaritay's aid]] will give regular weapons a 10% damage bonus against Dessous.\n*He also has low [[Magic defence]], so the highest max hit spell you can cast will make it possible to kill him quickly.\n*Dessous sometimes teleports to you if you use prayer. He may occasionally still do so randomly however. He will not teleport if you are within melee range.\n*If you make him teleport more than three times, he'll say he's bored and will leave, causing you to have to start the fight again with a new pot.\n** If the chatbox says Dessous has gotten bored and left when his health has been fully depleted, it means you have defeated him.\n*Dying or leaving the fight earlier will require a new pot to be filled and used on the tomb.\n*Dessous has two attacks: a melee attack that is rapid and accurate '''(3-tick speed, hits up to 19)''', and a combination range and magic attack that always hits '''double 5's (totaling to 10)'''. Because of this, it's strongly recommended to use '''[[protect from melee]]''', reducing his max hit to 10 at any given time.\n*'''Never let your health drop below 16''', as his double 5's will sometimes lag, stacking up to 15 altogether.\n*He '''cannot''' be safespotted through the fence, but it can be used to effectively [[flinch]] him.\n*The [[silver pot]] is correctly prepared if the [[Magic]] and [[Ranged]] combo attack only hits a maximum of two 5's and he switches between that attack and melee.\n*If you know how to \"1-tick flick\" your prayers, you can avoid all damage by flicking between Protect from Melee and Protect from Missiles.\n[[File:Dessous spawns.gif|thumb|right|Dessous comes out of the grave.]]\n\n====Notes for pures====\n* A [[Dwarf multicannon]] can be used to kill Dessous, although it will be fairly inaccurate against him. Be sure to set up the cannon '''before''' opening the coffin, and bring at least 75 cannonballs.\n* [[Tick eating]] can be used to survive with low HP, but the double 5s make this difficult to do, so keeping HP above 10 is a must. For low HP pures, it's recommended to use foods that boost HP above your current level such as [[Guthix rest]]s (requires [[One Small Favour]]) and [[Saradomin brew]]s. At 10 HP, a brew will boost your HP by 3; you can eat a slice of [[pineapple pizza]] and then drink a brew in the same tick, restoring/boosting your HP to 13 after every hit Dessous makes.\n\nOnce Dessous is dead, return to [[Malak]] in [[Canifis]] to claim the [[Blood diamond]], and deposit it in the bank as quickly as possible to avoid being attacked by the Stranger. If you lose the diamond, reclaim it from Malak. You will not have to fight Dessous again.\n\n'''Note:''' If the player wishes to keep the pot or other variants (including copies), the player should drop them before speaking with Malak or reclaiming a lost diamond from him.\n\n==Ice diamond==\n{{Needed|A sweet ([[cake]], [[chocolate cake]] (partial cakes work), or [[chocolate bar]]), [[Spiked boots]], a way to get to [[Troll child]] ([[Trollheim Teleport]], [[climbing boots]], or [[Ghommal's hilt 1]]+), several [[super restore]], [[menaphite remedy]] or [[restore potion]]s, equipment and supplies to kill 5 [[Ice troll]]s and [[Kamil]] (if using magic, runes for [[fire spells]] and be on the [[standard spellbook]]. Kamil is immune to all other spells, including Iban Blast and Flames of Zamorak).|recommended=Several [[prayer potion]]s, good [[food]] ([[lobster]]s or better), and an emergency one-click teleport that doesn't have a Magic requirement, such as the [[Ectophial]] or a [[magic tablet]].}}\n[[File:Ice Path map.png|thumb|right|After reaching [[Trollheim]], the [[Ice Path]] is due north-west.]]\n\n[[Kamil]] is the next boss and arguably the hardest boss of the quest. Due to the many factors that come into play during this fight, it's highly recommended to thoroughly read this section before continuing.\n\n* [[Protect from Melee]] is '''highly''' recommended otherwise the [[ice troll]]s and [[Ice Wolf|ice wolves]] on the way to Kamil will deal a lot of damage. The trolls are in single combat, while the wolves are in multicombat.\n* It is recommended to restock and restore stats after each step because everything will be heavily drained.\n* While not in combat, mainly right after entering the ice cave or hiding behind the boulder after passing the wolves, it's possible to stall the cold effect by activating a prayer that you don't have unlocked yet, and leaving the dialogue box open. This can be good for those who need to reread a section before proceeding.\n\n===Feeding the trolls===\nMake your way to [[Trollheim]], and then take the north-western path to the [[Troll child]]. If following the path from [[Burthorpe]], you will need a pair of [[Climbing Boots]] as well as [[Spiked Boots]]. You will need to pass the [[Thrower Troll (Trollheim)|thrower troll]]s; [[Protect from Missiles]] will negate their damage entirely, otherwise [[food]] or another player to tank is required. '''Do not''' enter the path with a boulder in the way; that leads to the [[God Wars Dungeon]]. Go down the previous path, which leads to the [[Troll child]] and the entrance to the [[Ice Path]]. It should start to snow as you approach the gate (note that the stat-reducing effects '''only occur once you pass through the Ice Gate''', making this a safe area to wait).\n\nUpon talking to the Troll child, he'll cry, and won't speak to you. Use a [[cake]] or other sweet on him and then speak to him again to learn that his parents are frozen further up the path. Attempt to enter the Ice Gate, the Troll child will explain why it is frozen. Enter the Ice Gate once more to squeeze through it.\n\nWhile on the Ice Path, your stats will be drained every few seconds, your run energy will instantly be reduced to 0, and you will take 1 damage every time the cold hits. All of your [[Special attack]] energy will be drained as well, so [[special attack]] [[boosts]] should be done before entering. Restore potions will recover drained stats, and Super restore potions will do the same, as well as restore Prayer points. Otherwise multiple trips can be taken by using a [[ring of dueling]] to teleport to [[Ferox Enclave]] and drink from one of the [[pools of refreshment]] to restore all stats.\n\nOnce past the Ice Gate, you have to kill five [[ice troll]]s, regardless of their level. However, it is worth noting that the ice trolls with higher levels have lower defensive stats in exchange for higher offensive stats, making them easier to kill if using Protect from Melee. They can hit up to '''25''', so use [[Protect from Melee]] or safespot them with [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] to be more safe. The [[dwarf multicannon]] works here, but can be inaccurate against the trolls, so be sure to bring several hundred cannonballs. They retreat when safespotted. The five trolls do not have to be killed in succession, you can leave and return without losing progress. After killing five trolls at the gate, the cave will have thawed open, allowing you to enter and proceed to Kamil.\n\nIf you forget how many trolls you've killed, you can check your progress by examining the cave or by counting the number of chatbox messages that are: ''\"A chunk of ice falls away from the cave entrance...\"'', if you haven't logged out, as killing a troll causes that message to appear until you've killed five. '''It is recommended you go back to the bank and restock your supplies before returning.'''\n\n===Killing Kamil===\n[[File:Kamil safespot.png|thumb|Another player can block [[Kamil]], acting as a [[Safespot]] for the attacker.]]\nEnter the cave and follow the [[Ice Path]] until you reach [[Kamil]]. '''This path contains multiple [[Ice wolf|ice wolves]] capable of hitting 16s in multicombat, so protect from melee or a lot of food is a must.''' Another account can be used to tank damage as well. Continue walking and the path will open up and turn to the left, walk until you find a rock, marking the area where you will find Kamil. ''You'll get a message saying \"You can feel an evil presence nearby...\" when you enter the area.''\n\n====The fight====\n*[[Kamil]] uses two attacks, a strong melee attack capable of hitting up to 23, and a magic attack similar to Dessous' combination attack which always hits 5. '''Due to lag it's possible for these to stack to 10, so it's recommended to keep hp at 12 or above at all times.''' He also consistently freezes you with this attack by using a spell resembling [[Ice Barrage]], especially if outside of melee range. When frozen, you're unable to move or attack for several seconds so you'll only have a few ticks (if any) to get off attacks before being frozen again. Hiding behind the rock does not work anymore, and neither does having another player block Kamil. You cannot cast from behind the rock, and Kamil will teleport if you have another player blocking.\n*[[Protect from Melee]] is a '''highly''' recommended, otherwise you will deal very little damage due to constant eating.\n*When using [[Magic]], '''only''' [[fire spells]] can damage Kamil. Due to the [[temporary skill drain]] it is recommended to use a spell significantly below your base Magic level. Even though stats can be restored, it is much more reliable. [[Fire Bolt]] is a good option, along with [[chaos gauntlets]] and a [[tome of fire]]. Also note, [[Iban Blast]] will '''not''' work against [[Kamil]] as it is not a fire spell.\n*Melee combat is not recommended. \n*[[Ranged]] is not recommended, however a fast, strong weapon like the [[toxic blowpipe]] will be accurate against him.\n\n====Notes for pures====\n*A [[dwarf multicannon]] can also be used against Kamil, it should be set up two squares north of the rock, allowing them to safely hide from Kamil, but restock it when it runs out of cannonballs. Since the cannon's position will cause it to attack the wolves as well, be sure to bring enough (100+) cannonballs to kill him.\n*Low hitpoints pures may find reaching the cave difficult, as there are dozens of trolls in the area, and it's single combat; one way around this is to enter a [[PvP world]] and remove your weapon and attack a friend, keeping them in combat with you and as such avoiding being attacked by the trolls. '''If using this method, do NOT eat until you've made it to the cave, as the delay from combat while eating will cause the trolls to attack you.'''\n\n===The parent trap===\n[[File:Desert Treasure freeing ice trolls.png|thumb|right|Thawing the ice troll child's parents.]]\nOnce Kamil is defeated, you need to free the troll parents. Follow the path west, then north, then east as it loops around until you reach the edge of an ice ledge surrounded by ice formations. If you check the world map (or the map above), you can see the path you need to take.\n\nPut on your [[spiked boots]] and ''Use'' the ice ledge to climb up. You will be on a long spiraling ice path which you must follow all the way up to reach the parents. You may slip and fall, taking some damage as you walk. Using [[super restore]]s to restore your [[Agility]] level will help here. At the top, pass through the ice gate and walk along the path until you see two ice blocks containing the troll parents. Attack the ice blocks, which have 10 [[Hitpoints]] each. They can be smashed or attacked, however with low stats it may be difficult to deal damage accurately, so the super restore from Kamil should be used.\n\nIf you have 49 [[Prayer]], [[Redemption]] can be used to heal with '''all''' of your remaining Prayer points to stay alive after running out of food as a last resort. It will sustain you if you have more [[prayer potion]]s or super restores.\n\nAfter freeing the troll parents, they will take you back outside the gate and give you the [[ice diamond]]. If lost, talk to the Troll child to receive another. Kamil will not have to be fought again.\n\n==The Ancient Pyramid==\n{{Needed|[[Shantay pass (item)|Shantay pass]]es, [[waterskin]]s, [[blood diamond]], [[ice diamond]], [[smoke diamond]], [[shadow diamond]], coins for [[magic carpet]] rides (bring a [[ring of charos (a)]] for discounted rides)|recommended=[[Weight-reducing equipment]] such as [[graceful clothing]], [[Prayer items|prayer boosting equipment]], 2+ [[prayer potion]]s, 1 [[super antipoison]] (or some [[strange fruit]]), several [[energy potion]]s or 1 [[stamina potion]], [[food]] ([[summer pie]]s recommended), and an emergency teleport, 80,000 [[coins]] if buying [[Ancient Staff]].}}\n\nReturn to [[Eblis]] at the six mirrors in the desert with all four diamonds in your inventory. Speak with him, then go to the [[Ancient Pyramid]] south-east of Eblis (marked \"Jaldraocht Pyramid\" on the world map). Place each diamond in its respective obelisk on the corners around the base of the pyramid (requires level 50 [[Magic]]). Each obelisk's tip and centre have a colour related to the specific diamond that needs to be placed there. Diamonds will only fit in the correct obelisk and cannot be removed afterwards.\n\n[[File:Ancient Pyramid pillar.png|thumb|right|The pillar absorbs the gem.]]\nWhen all four obelisks are activated, the pyramid will no longer be blocked, and can be entered from the top.\n\n'''Note:''' To keep duplicate diamonds after the quest, drop the duplicates before putting the last diamond into the pyramid's last unpowered obelisk. After this is done, the quest can be safely completed without the diamonds being automatically removed from one's inventory or bank.\n\n===Tomb raider===\n[[Desert heat]] is not a problem while inside the pyramid, but most of the interior is dangerous. Level 92 [[scarab swarm]]s occasionally erupt out of the floor while level 103 [[Mummy (Ancient Pyramid)|mummies]] roam about and level 96 [[Mummy (Ancient Pyramid sarcophagus)|mummies]] spontaneously pop out of [[Sarcophagus (Ancient Pyramid)|sarcophagi]]. All monsters use [[Melee]] only, though scarab swarms can [[poison]]. \n\nEvery time a scarab swarm appears or a mummy pops out of a sarcophagus, you will stop moving, and will not be able to move until the animation has finished. It is possible to avoid a scarab swarm entirely by making sure it is behind a mummy. There are also randomly activated traps that will send you back to the entrance of the pyramid. Bring [[weight-reducing clothing]] and plenty of [[super energy potion]]s or [[stamina potion]]s to maintain [[run energy]] or restore it quicker if it depletes. If you get caught by a trap, you will be taken outside to the south side of the pyramid but with no damage done. Do not click directly to the ladder; keep clicking to your goal as this will reduce the chances of getting caught by traps. It is useful to use a [[strange fruit]] while inside the pyramid due to the fact that it recovers 30% run energy and cures any kind of poison you may have gotten while inside the pyramid.\n\n''The levels in the pyramid are numbered in the order the player encounters them in the quest. The purple line marks the route.''\n\n====Outside====\nEnter the pyramid from its top. The southern entrance leading to the altar can only be used after the quest has been completed.\n[[File:Ancient Pyramid outside.png|center|thumb|Diagram of the pyramid's exterior]]\n\n====Level 1====\nRun from the entrance ladder to the Level 2 ladder. This level is the smallest in the area, with the fewest mummies.\n[[File:Ancient Pyramid level 1.png|center|thumb|Level 1 of the Ancient Pyramid]]\n\n====Level 2====\nThis level is the second smallest in area, with a few more mummies roaming about. This room might have a few traps.\n[[File:Ancient Pyramid level 2.png|center|thumb|Level 2 of the Ancient Pyramid]]\n\n====Level 3====\nThis level is fairly large in area, with a significant number of mummies. There is a vast amount of traps.\n[[File:Ancient Pyramid level 3.png|center|thumb|Level 3 of the Ancient Pyramid]]\n\n====Level 4====\nThis level is quite large in area, with mummies roaming about everywhere except the altar room. The altar room is separated by a door—do not rely on the minimap to run outside.\n[[File:Ancient Pyramid level 4.png|center|thumb|Level 4 of the Ancient Pyramid]]\n\n:''Easy tip to remember which way to start running after each level:'' north, east, south, west.\n\n===Azzanadra===\n[[File:Azzanadra is freed.png|thumb|300px|Azzanadra is released from his prison.]]\n[[File:Azzanadra (Desert Treasure I) chathead.png|left]]\nIt is possible for a [[scarab swarm]] to spawn inside the altar room, but this only happens if it was spawning as you were entering the room. If this is the case, trap it between the door and an obstacle that is just in front of the door. Speak to [[Azzanadra]], or spawn him by using the [[Altar (Ancient Pyramid)|altar]]. He has lost track of time and believes that the [[God Wars]] are still going on. He goes on to talk about ancient unknown civilizations like [[Paddewwa]], [[Lassar]] and [[Annakarl]]. He is also surprised to see that he cannot hear [[Zaros]] in his mind anymore.\n\nAfter talking, Azzanadra finally comes to peace with reality, rewarding the adventurer with the [[Ancient Magicks]] of Zaros for their efforts.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\nAt quest completion, you will be switched to the [[Ancient Magicks]] spellbook. Make sure you change back to the [[standard spellbook]] before you leave, if you prefer to be on it, by praying at the [[Altar (Ancient Pyramid)|altar]]. You can return here at any time via the back entrance of the pyramid to swap between the two.\n\n'''Note: '''Praying at the [[Altar (Ancient Pyramid)|altar]] twice after completing the quest will complete a [[Desert Diary|hard task in the Desert area]]. Do this before leaving the area.\n\n'''Note: '''Teleport to [[Paddewwa]] to complete a [[Varrock_Diary#Hard|Varrock hard diary]] task. This requires 2 Law Runes, 1 Air Rune, and 1 Fire rune.\n\n'''Note:''' After exiting the pyramid, and at any point after the quest, you can speak with Eblis to obtain both an [[ancient staff]] (for 80,000 gp) and an endless supply of [[ancient signet]]s (for free).\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Desert Treasure|image=[[File:Desert Treasure I reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=3|rewards=*{{SCP|Magic|20,006.9}} [[Magic]] [[experience]]{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/jagexash/status/1659205746851221507|date=18 May 2023|archiveurl=https://archive.is/dwIuo|archivedate=18 May 2023|quote=20,006.9, in fact!}}\n*The ability to use [[Ancient Magicks]]: At any time, you can pray at the [[Altar (Ancient Pyramid)|altar]] and change between the [[Standard spells|standard]] and Ancient Magicks spellbooks.

Players are recommended to read through each section below, and are also encouraged to practice fighting the bosses in order to better understand experiencing their mechanics.\n\nNon-[[Ironman Mode|ironman]] accounts with limited access to teleport options can use the [[Rimmington]] [[Portal (Player-owned house)|portal]] on world 330 to enter another player's [[Player-owned house|POH]], and utilize their various teleportation and restoration options. Before starting the quest, switch to the [[Ancient Magicks]] spellbook, as it is required to start the quest, and it will be needed or provide useful teleports in various sections.\n\nLastly, for each fight in the quest, a \"notes for [[pure]]s\" section will be included, allowing players with unique account builds to determine if completion is possible. Note that unlike Desert Treasure I, none of the bosses are [[Dwarf multicannon|cannonable]], and players '''must''' gain [[Hitpoints]] [[experience]] in order to progress.\n\n==Familiar Faces==\n{{Needed|Combat gear, a [[pickaxe]] (a bronze one is provided), rope, and runes to cast the four [[burst spells]] (or better).|recommended=Runes for [[Senntisten Teleport]], [[Digsite teleport]]s, [[stamina potion]]s, [[Dramen staff]], [[desert amulet]]/[[Nardah teleport]], protection from [[desert heat]].}}\n\n[[File:Asgarnia Smith chathead.png|left]]Make your way to the [[Ancient Vault]] just north-east of [[Nardah]]. It can easily be reached by use of [[fairy rings]] (code {{fairycode|dlq}}) and then running south-east, as well as using a [[Nardah teleport]] scroll or the [[desert amulet 3]] and then running north-east. You must be on the Ancient Magicks spellbook to open the vault. Once inside, you will enter a room with four statues, as well as see [[Asgarnia Smith]] follow you inside, who proposes another partnership with you after having found no treasure in your previous adventure with him.\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - meet Dr Banikan.png|thumb|300px|Meeting Dr Banikan in the new dig.]]\nAfter talking to him, inspect the four statues inside the vault, as well as the plaque on the far wall. Note the four names: Vardorvis, Perseriya, Duke Sucellus, and the Whisperer. Speak to Asgarnia again about what you found, and he will tell you to try speaking to [[Terry Balando]] for a possible lead.\n\nMake your way to the [[Exam Centre]] (either by using [[Senntisten Teleport]] or a [[Digsite teleport]]) and speak with [[Terry Balando]]. Though he tells you that [[Zaros]] is still a relative unknown to him, he recommends you to talk to [[Dr Banikan]], who in a stroke of fortune claims to be a Zarosian expert and has set up a new dig on the eastern edge of the Digsite.\n\nHead to the winch at the easternmost part of the Digsite; the [[Digsite teleport]] and [[Digsite pendant]] will get you near the area. Operate the winch to descend into the dig, where you'll find Dr Banikan. You will tell him about the Ancient Vault and the four names you saw in there, and he will tell you that they might be mentioned in what he believes is a key military installation underneath here, a remnant of the [[Zarosian Empire]]. He will ask that you mine the rocks nearby to clear the way down. If you need a pickaxe, a [[bronze pickaxe]] can be found by searching the crate to the north-east corner of the dig.\n\nPrepare for a combat encounter in the next section.\n\n===The Ancient Guardian===\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - fighting Ancient Guardian.png|thumb|300px|Fighting the Ancient Guardian.]]\nClimbing down will put you in an instanced area, where you will be immediately attacked by an [[Ancient Guardian (Desert Treasure II)|Ancient Guardian]]. The guardian has 200 health overall; you must first deplete its shield health, then continue with its regular health. Using melee attacks is recommended for this fight, as the shield health will quickly regenerate if you're not using melee.\n\nThe guardian will only use melee attacks, which can be negated with [[Protect from Melee]]. However, every five attacks, the ceiling will crumble and cause debris to fall from above, dealing 15–25 damage if they are not avoided; move away from the looming shadow on the ground to avoid these.\n\n'''Notes for pures'''\n\nThe need for semi-rapid damage means that it's impossible to drain the guardian's shield without gaining Hitpoints experience. However, any melee style will work. For players who don't use melee, it is technically possible to use [[magic]] or [[ranged]] to kill the guardian, but high-damage spells or ammunition must be used, and the player must remain in melee distance.\n\n===Military Secrets===\nAfter defeating the Ancient Guardian, you will call down Dr Banikan, who will follow you around the military installation. Inspect the [[Golem (Desert Treasure II)|golem machine]] further into the area, where you will find that it needs eight cells to power up. Search the nearby crates to receive a stack of eight [[Uncharged cell (Desert Treasure II)|uncharged cells]].\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - charging totems.png|thumb|300px|Charging the totems inside the military installation.]]\nTo the west is an altar surrounded by four totems. Cast [[burst spells]] or better on the respective totems to activate them, then use the cells on the altar to obtain [[charged cell]]s. Use these on the golem, where you will need to complete a puzzle to power it up: One cell per section, one cell per row, one cell per column, and no adjacent cells. If you attempt to power the golem with the wrong solution, you will take 5–10 damage from an electric shock.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+Solution to the golem puzzle\n|[[File:Desert Treasure II - golem puzzle solution.png]]\n|}\n\nOnce the golem is powered up, search for the names from the Ancient Vault: \"Vardorvis\", \"Perseriya\", \"Sucellus\", and \"Whisperer\"; the inputs are fairly generous for typos. Other search terms can be put in, though unnecessary to progress in the quest; the player can return here after the quest to search for more terms should they wish to, or view a list of terms [[Golem (Desert Treasure II)|here]].\n\nAfter searching the aforementioned terms, Dr Banikan will thank you for your help, and proceeds to use the golem to search for a term, then tells you he will need to consult with a good friend of his and leaves the military installation. Curious, you ask the golem to repeat the last search: the Frostenhorn.\n\n===Testing Your Medal===\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - meeting the Mysterious Figure.png|thumb|300px|The Mysterious Figure appears after retrieving the first medallion.]]\n[[File:Mysterious Figure chathead.png|left]]\nThe next four sections will involve retrieving the medallions of the Forgotten Four, and can be done in any order. Note that the medallions cannot be deposited into a bank, and should be returned to the [[Ancient Vault]] as soon as possible.\n\nUpon attempting to return the first medallion, you will be greeted by the [[Mysterious Figure]], who demands the medallion be given to her in order to further her mistress' goal. You'll refuse, and she'll say she will let you go this time, but warns you to watch your back before leaving.\n\nSubsequent acquisitions of medallions may result in her ambushing you; she uses all three attack styles, hitting up to 18 damage with each. In addition, she is able to [[run]], cast [[Tele Block]], use [[blood spells]] to heal herself and [[ice spells]] to freeze you to the spot, and utilise [[protection prayers|protection Prayers]]. Thus, players should always try to keep some spare food and an emergency teleport on them at all times. Note that she may also disguise herself as the [[sandwich lady]]; avoid talking to her if you are holding a medallion to avoid combat.\n\nTeleporting away before she manages to cast Tele Block, or simply entering a room or a separate floor are both effective ways of avoiding her. Defeating her will not prevent her from reappearing at a later time, as she will simply teleport away. Due to this, as well as her high Hitpoints and Prayer switching mechanics, it is not recommended to fight her until her dedicated fight section later in the quest. Note as well that she can spawn multiple times, and will also spawn in a player-owned house.  Enabling building mode as default does not ensure your safety.\n\n==Carnifex Maximus Vardorvis==\n{{Needed|Melee combat gear ([[slash weapon]]), food, [[Prayer]] restores, two free inventory spaces, [[hammer]].|recommended=[[Stamina potion]], runes for [[ice spells]], coins for the [[Lovakengj Minecart Network]], [[Xeric's talisman]], [[lockpick]] for the [[Stone chest]].}}\n\nYou will need to access a faraway area in the [[Kebos Lowlands]] for this section; having access to [[fairy rings]], the Xeric's Honour teleport from [[Xeric's talisman]], or the Quidamortem station of the [[Lovakengj Minecart Network]] are helpful. Having unlocked all routes from the [[Mountain Guide]] will also be of great use.\n[[File:Elissa chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nExit the military installation and speak to [[Elissa]] just north-east of the digsite. Tell her that you heard she visited [[Lovakengj]] recently, and that you are looking for information on Vardorvis. Though she doesn't know much, she believes the Burning Man monument in the city, which represents the defeat of an ancient evil, may be a good place to start your search.\n[[File:Burning Man.png|thumb|300px|The Burning Man, representing the defeat of an ancient evil.]]\nHead to the [[Burning Man]] monument, found on the western side of [[Lovakengj]]. If you have [[Xeric's talisman]], teleport to Xeric's Inferno, then run south-west. Talk to [[Barus]], a Lovakengj historian who will explain the history of the Burning Man. He will then mention [[The Stranglewood]], a cursed place between the [[Kebos Lowlands]] and [[Varlamore]] from which the great evil came, and also tells you that a botanist who lived near the Hosidius [[Estate agent|Estate Agent]] attempted to explore The Stranglewood and went missing.\n\nThe Estate Agent's building is at the north-eastern end of [[Hosidius]], and the botanist's house is adjacent to his. If you have [[Xeric's talisman]], teleport to Xeric's Glade and run north, or use [[Kharedst's memoirs]] to teleport to Hosidius and run north-east across the [[River Hos]]. In the botanist's house, search the desk to receive a [[Strange potion (Desert Treasure II)|strange potion]] and [[potion note]]. Read the note to learn about the potion, as well as the location of a rowboat to The Stranglewood, found south of [[Mount Quidamortem]].\n\nIf you have access to [[fairy rings]], use the code {{fairycode|bls}} to teleport to the base of the mountain, then run west towards the rowboat. The fairy ring nearest to the botanist's house is just north of the Tithe Farm at the Hosidius Vinery. If you have unlocked the Xeric's Honour teleport, you can use the bank on Mount Quidamortem to resupply before departing, then speaking to the [[Mountain Guide]] to take you to the crossroads east of where the rowboat is. When you reach the rowboat, drink the strange potion and board the rowboat to travel to The Stranglewood.\n\n===Freaky Forest===\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - The Stranglewood.png|thumb|300px|A horde of Strangled.]]\nWhile in The Stranglewood, be aware that the area is full of high-level [[Strangled]] who will trap you in place with roots and deal continual damage. There is also a health bar on the top left of the screen that indicates your infection level; if it reaches 100%, you will be overwhelmed by the infection and respawn at the last location you were uninfected. Stone chests can be found throughout the area and searched for [[tatty page]]s, which can be read for information on the Zarosians' presence shortly after their arrival here; this step expands the lore of the quest, but is not necessary for completion.\n\nFollow the path south and enter the city as fast as you can. Ignore any Strangled and run south to a fork, and then west to the entrance, at which point a cutscene will play where you run into a large horde of Strangled, and make your way into a nearby barricaded building. You will meet [[Kasonde Shaw]], who you indirectly interacted with during [[The Garden of Death]]. He will accuse you of tailing him, but quickly realises you alerted a horde of Strangled by disturbing the tendrils nearby, and tells you to head to safety below.\n\n===Protecting Kasonde===\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - protecting Kasonde.png|thumb|300px|Protecting Kasonde from the oncoming Strangled.]]\n[[File:Kasonde chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nFor this section, you will have to defend Kasonde for three minutes from oncoming waves of the Strangled. Failing will simply start the activity over, so there's no need to worry about death. Around the area are six stone chests, four of which need to be lock-picked, and which contain a total of two [[Barricade (Desert Treasure II)|barricades]] and four [[Satchel (Desert Treasure II)|satchels]]. The satchels contain explosives that can be [[Detonator|detonated remotely]], which is effective at wiping out large groups; the explosion will instantly kill the Strangled. If the player is in the explosion radius when detonated, they will take heavy damage, so it is recommended to stay a safe distance before doing so. Barricades help provide a temporary reprieve, forcing the Strangled to break it down; players may still attack through them with halberds, ranged or magic.\n\nTo open the chests, simply move the tumblers by clicking on slots above them. The fastest way to brute force the lock is to simply click confirm, see if any show up as green on the right, and if not, move everything up by one. This will take no more than eight tries for the final combination.\n\nOnce three minutes pass, any remaining Strangled will automatically die.\n\nKasonde will tell you where the waves of Strangled are coming in from, so plan accordingly and time the detonations right. If barricades break, [[ice spells]] are recommended to freeze the Strangled, as they will quickly focus down Kasonde.\n\n===Breaking The Stranglehold===\nTalk to Kasonde to learn about the [[Old Ones]], where he tells you [[The Strangler]] was the result of a failed ritual to overcome their extinction. He warns you that The Strangler infects living things who get too close, and can alert nearby Strangled if you step on one of its tendrils. However, some plants have an immunity to the infection, and Kasonde believes they can be used to create a better version of the serum you drank before coming here. Before leaving, take some [[stink bomb]]s from the south-east stone chest. Should you die during this section your gravestone will appear outside the rowboat you used to enter The Stranglewood. \n[[File:Desert Treasure II - The Stranglewood map.png|thumb|400px|A map of The Stranglewood.]]\nThe Strangled move in a shuffle, and will only attack if you get too close. Walking will reduce the aggression range compared to running. If they notice you, they will say {{overhead|Nngh...|color=#ff7373}} and begin to run towards you; other Strangled within range of the one that was alerted will yell {{overhead|!|color=#ff7373}} and attack as well. [[Strange shrine (The Stranglewood)|Strange shrines]] can also be found around the area to restore run energy.\n\nWalking over a tendril will alert Strangled from a much wider area, including past obstacles where the player cannot attack through. Therefore, it is important to avoid stepping on them. Attacking Strangled from a distance will also prevent them from alerting others, which is very useful when combat is required. If you are struggling with gathering the ingredients, you can use [[ice spells]] to freeze Strangled in place, though they have a degree of freeze resistance and will not stay frozen for the full duration. [[Stink bomb]]s can also be used to attract the nearest Strangled to where it was set off to keep them away.\n\nThe first item Kasonde requires is a [[korbal herb]], located slightly north-west of the large temple. From the barricade, head south-west to the first intersection. While avoiding the red tendrils, run directly north, head east past the south side of the large pyramid, and then run north again. The Korbal herb is located on a small outcrop with a [[Strangled Boar|strangled boar]]. Once you have picked this herb, if you become fully infected, you will respawn near here.\n\nThe next item is [[argian berries]], found at the south-western camp near a [[Strangled Lynx|strangled lynx]]. From the herbs, run south towards the bridge and run south-west near lynx. If you need a break, running south-east after the bridge will lead towards [[the Stranglewood mine|The Stranglewood Mine]], which does not contain any Strangled, though you will need to kill any pursuing you if they follow. Once you have picked these berries, if you become fully infected, you will respawn near here. Likewise, leaving and arriving by rowboat takes you back to this camp.\n\nOnce you have both items, head to the temple, which is north-west of the building you and Kasonde were hiding in initially. Once inside, kill the two Strangled attacking Kasonde, and then talk to him. You will find out that he has been infected by The Strangler, but that he also has Koreps{{Sic}} Syndrome, which is a deadly disease with no cure. His best hope was the secrets of the Old Ones, which may lie at the ritual site just west from the temple.\n\nHe will ask that you brew the potion and head there to see what you can find. He will then give you an [[unfinished serum]]; add the [[korbal herb]], then the [[argian berries]] to create the [[Strangler serum]]. Drinking it will grant you permanent immunity from The Strangler's infection, but not from the damage dealt by the Strangled.\n\n===Vanquishing Vardorvis===\n{{Main|Vardorvis/Strategies}}\nGear up to fight [[Vardorvis]], who is located in the snowy square west of the temple, marked on the map as \"Ritual Site\". The first time you go, you will need to run south, west to the bridge, south over the bridge, west across another bridge, and then north over a final bridge until you reach the ritual site. However, after entering the ritual site once, you can start to use a shortcut by going down the entry in the north-west area, next to where the [[korbal herb]]s were found, and then running west to the ritual site. When you're ready, enter the site by climbing the rocks in the north-west clearing and attack Vardorvis, now one of the Strangled.\n\nVardorvis is weakest to slash attacks, with crush being a somewhat acceptable alternative. He is a 2x2 monster, so players using a [[scythe of vitur]] will only hit twice, though it still outperforms most slash weapons. Despite being an undead vampyre, [[Blisterwood weaponry]] does not provide additional bonuses, so stick with high slash weapons such as [[dragon scimitar]], [[abyssal whip]], [[abyssal tentacle]], [[zombie axe]] or [[Blade of saeldor]]. He has a unique mechanic active at all times during the fight in that as his health lowers, his [[Defence]] level will decrease by 1 for every 10 damage, but likewise his [[Strength]] level will increase by 1 for the same amount. This makes him easier to hit as the fight goes on, but players will need to watch out for his higher max hit. Due to this, defence drains aren't as effective as they would be elsewhere.\n\n[[File:Fighting Vardorvis.png|thumb|300px|Vardorvis, now one of the Strangled.]]\nVardorvis uses a melee attack, which can be reduced by 75% with Protect from Melee, as well as four special attacks:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Image\n!Attack name\n!Description\n!Priority\n|-\n|[[File:Vardorvis axe attack.png|frameless|width=131x131]]\n|'''Swinging axes'''\n|Two or three axes appear within the arena. Find a safe section of the arena to avoid this attack. Getting hit with this attack will incur a \"bleed\" effect of residual damage hits of 2. Moving around while bleed effect is active will cause the damage to appear more frequently. Avoid the centre of the arena.\n|High\n|-\n|[[File:Vardorvis ground spikes.png|frameless|width=115x115]]\n|'''Homing spikes'''\n|Vardorvis will slam the ground, causing spikes to form underneath the player. Quickly move to avoid taking damage. These can be avoided by standing in-between the two northern pillars.\n|High\n|-\n|[[File:Vardorvis' Head.png|frameless|width=122x122]]\n|'''Head projectile'''\n|[[Vardorvis' Head]] will appear from the ground and shoot a green projectile that will turn off overhead Prayers. Protect from Missiles negates this special attack, and should be switched to immediately, even if in melee range, as it does not attack in sync with the body. Should the attack land, walk under the boss to stall his damage and reactivate your Prayers.\n|Highest\n|-\n|[[File:Virus cell.png|frameless|width=65x65]]\n|'''Virus cells'''\n|The player's screen will be covered with a red tendril and 3–8 red spores will appear in the centre. Quickly click on all of the spores in order to mitigate damage from the root.\n|Highest\n|}\n\nUpon hitting 33% of his health, Vardorvis will enter an enrage phase that increases the frequency of axes being thrown and his head popping out from the ground. Players should keep their health and prayer as high as possible so they can react properly to the mechanics.\n\nNote that simply standing in a single corner and letting one axe hit you can be significantly less damaging than running around. The axes hit below 20 if Protect from Melee is on, and the bleed deals 10-15 damage if you don't move; as such, keeping movement to a minimum will prevent a majority of damage. Players using this strategy should only move to dodge the floor spikes. Standing next to the southern pillar in the south-east corner will avoid all but one axe, and the floor spikes will never reach you there, allowing players to camp their Prayer book.\n\n'''Notes for pures'''\n\nWith practice, it's possible to negate almost all damage. However, chip damage can still take away health, leaving lower-Hitpoints accounts vulnerable. While much more difficult, it's possible to kill him with magic or ranged. Experienced players can kill him with no Prayer. He '''can''' be damaged by a [[ring of recoil]], which helps dramatically given his chip damage. He is immune to poison.\n\nAfter defeating Vardorvis, pick up the [[Temple key (Desert Treasure II)|temple key]] and return to the temple. If you die at the same time as [[Vardorvis]] or die before picking up the key, it can still be found by searching the rocks.\n\nIf the player's supplies were depleted after killing Vardorvis, '''immediately return to a bank and resupply''', as a second boss fight is coming up.\n\n===Killing Kasonde===\n{{Needed|recommended=Ranged gear, food, [[Prayer]] restores, [[anti-venom]], [[ranging potion]], [[stamina potion]].}}\nGive the [[Temple key (Desert Treasure II)|temple key]] to [[Kasonde]]. He will tell you that he found something beyond the doors, but needs to return to [[Kourend]] for the medical equipment to treat his condition. However, as he is already infected by The Strangler, you will protest his decision, deeming it too high a risk to spread the infection - leaving him no choice but to fight his way through you.\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - fighting Kasonde.png|thumb|300px|The player fights Kasonde to protect Kourend.]]\n[[Kasonde]] will attack you with accurate melee and ranged attacks, and will also occasionally heal as you fight; the only way to defeat him is to out-damage his healing. In addition, he also has two special attacks:\n* '''Potions''' - Kasonde will periodically throw potions on where you're standing. Walk away from where he aimed to avoid it, otherwise you will take 35+ damage. If you avoid it, the contents will spill on the floor, preventing you from standing there again. \n** The '''green''' potions will inflict venom, requiring an [[anti-venom]]. The serpentine helm is useful here, as it provides high defensive bonuses and blocks venom damage.\n** The '''orange''' potions will damage you for 10–20 Hitpoints, and disable protection Prayers. Running over the orange splats will also cause them to trigger.\n* '''Potion Barrage''' - Kasonde will dash away from you, then turn around and throw 3-4 green and 3-4 orange potions towards you. If you can get him to run back behind a pillar, he will throw the potions in a much tighter cluster, meaning less of the arena will be covered, making running easier.\n* '''Explosion''' - a charged attack. This can be avoided by blocking his line of sight with one of the pillars around the room.\n\n'''Helpful Tips'''\n\nThe most effective strategy is to attack him with range, while using [[Protect from Missiles]], running around the room so he can't get in melee distance. A crossbow with [[diamond bolts (e)]] works well, as do 10-tile range weapons like the [[crystal bow]] or [[Bow of faerdhinen|bow of Faerdhinen]] alongside [[Crystal equipment|crystal armour]]. Try to kite him short distances between the pillars, rather than running from end to end on the arena. You will find kiting him much easier when the blobs are clustered together, rather than spread out. If he starts his Potion Barrage, try to get him behind a pillar so he only throws them in front of himself, in a small area.\n\nKasonde's magic defense is too high for magic to be effective. \n\nMelee can also be used: step back when he attacks and use a spec weapon such as a [[Dragon dagger]] or [[Dragon claws]] to burst down his last health, when his healing is the strongest. Melee will damage him faster but will expose the player to more damage, and makes some of his attacks more difficult to dodge properly.\n\nIf you defeat each other at the same time, you do not need to fight him again; Kasonde will be kneeling on the ground, defeated, when you return.\n\nThe floor splats also cannot be ran over, so walking diagonally can be your best options for getting out of tough situations\n\n'''Notes for pures'''\n\nDefence doesn't really come into factor during this fight, but [[Dps|damage output]] does; lower levels may find it difficult to out-damage his healing. Bringing a special attack weapon that deals rapid damage, such as the [[dragon dagger]], may be beneficial when Kasonde is around 75–80 Hitpoints; simply switch to the weapon and dump all four specs into him. Make sure to eat up before going into melee range, as he can frequently hit in the high twenties.\n\nIf you defeat each other at the same time, you do not need to fight him again; Kasonde will be kneeling on the ground, defeated, when you return.\n\nAfter defeating him, talk to him once more to discover that he already had found [[Vardorvis' medallion]] before you arrived, and that he kept it hidden fearing you wouldn't help him if he gave it to you. He will tell you it is in a chest back in his hideout, and dies.\n\nShould you wish to, proceed to the next room and search the stone chest for the final entry of the [[tatty page]]s. Return to the barricaded building where you first met Kasonde, and search the stone chest in the north east corner to obtain Vardorvis' medallion. Take it to the [[Ancient Vault]] and place it on Vardorvis' statue in the north-east corner.\n\n==Praefectus Classis Perseriya==\n{{Needed|Combat gear, [[slayer helmet]] or [[facemask]].|recommended=[[Stamina potion]], [[amulet of the eye|amulet of the Eye]].}}\nMake your way to the [[Temple of the Eye (location)|Temple of the Eye]]. This can be reached quickly via the [[amulet of the eye]] teleport, the minigame [[grouping]] teleport, or via the portal in the [[Wizard's Tower]] basement (fairy ring code {{Fairycode|dis}}).\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - entering the Scar.png|thumb|300px|Chaos in The Scar.]]\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - Persten lives.png|thumb|300px|Mia Persten lives!]]\nSpeak to the [[Catalytic Guardian]] by the [[Portal (Temple of the Eye)|portal]], who has been waiting to inform you that [[The Great Guardian]] has detected a magical signal of unknown origin emerging from the rift. You will ask to be transported to [[The Scar]], despite recommendations against it by the Catalytic Guardian, but it will help you enter by using the magical signal as a guide to send you roughly to where it is coming from.\n\nUpon entering The Scar, you will run into a fight between the local inhabitants; several [[Abyssal leech (The Scar)|abyssal leeches]], [[Abyssal walker (The Scar)|walkers]] against a group of six demons; one [[lesser demon|lesser]], [[greater demon|greater]] and [[black demon]] and their scarred variants. The scarred demons are a bit stronger than the normal demons. The monsters will change aggression to you if attacked, so an option for lower-leveled players is to let them fight it out and then mop up the stragglers.\n\n'''Note:''' If you leave The Scar after killing all of the monsters and return later, you '''do not''' have to kill them again.\n\nAfter crossing the stones, run all the way east to the rowboat and attempt to board it, and you will be interrupted by none other than [[Wizard Persten]], who has survived her entry into The Scar. She will take you back to her camp nearby, and tells you that she could have left whenever she wanted to, but she sent the signal in hopes of someone capable following it and joining her. In fact, she believes that an old ship contains something she needs, but cannot get past the sea creature that roams the lake, and you reveal that you were looking for Perseriya's ship, which is the same ship she is trying to reach.\n\nThe sea creature will need dealing with, and she proposes that you burn up what remains of Perseriya's fleet to quite literally smoke it out. She asks you to go down three nearby tunnels and set the ships alight so that she can redirect the smoke to the sea creature.\n\nEnter through the first open passage and proceed to solve the puzzles in the maze. You can safely leave The Scar and restock on supplies once you complete a puzzle. Because the passage that players arrive in varies, the next three sections may appear out of order for players, but all three must be completed before the passage to one of Perseriya's ships is opened.\n\nThroughout the mazes you will find chests with [[scarred scraps]]. These restore 20% run energy (and provide a [[Stamina|stamina effect]]), 15 Hitpoints, and 25% of the player's Prayer points. Each subsequent passages will have [[scarred lesser demon]]s with different combat styles, so focus on a single protection Prayers for each specific passage.\n\nLastly, subsequent passages will require a [[slayer helmet]] or [[facemask]], or you will periodically choke and take 10 damage. The final passage will deal damage to the player even with a facemask, although it will be reduced if the mask is worn.\n\n=== Disrupting The Scar ===\n\n==== South-east passage ====\n''Monsters here will attack with '''melee'''''.<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nDesert Treasure II - the Scar axon terminals.png|The Axon Terminal.\nDesert Treasure II - the Scar broken nerve endings.png|The Broken Nerve Endings.\nDesert Treasure II - the Scar summoning circle.png|The Summoning Circle.\n</gallery>[[File:Desert Treasure II - the Scar level 1.png|thumb|350px|A map of the first level of The Scar.]]\nEntering the south-east passage will bring the player to the south-east of the '''first level''', by the [[File:Dungeon icon.png]] on the minimap. A [[gooey note]] and [[slimy tablet]] can be found as well, indicated on the map to the right.\n\n===== Axon Terminal =====\nThe first room is the Axon Terminal. Here, players must hit [[abyssal axon]]s toward their corresponding terminal, either diagonally or directly. Players must also avoid lightning strikes in this room, which can deal around 15 damage. The strikes can be easily avoided by walking away from the shadows that appear on the ground. Should players find a monster stuck, they may select the \"reset\" option on it to automatically kill and respawn it back in its original location.\n\n===== Broken Nerve Endings =====\nHere, players must dive in and break the nerve endings around the area, and combine them to the appropriate nerve endings in the centre of the room. The nerve endings will respond shortly after being broken. There is limited air in the room, requiring players to use the air bubbles around the room to replenish their oxygen. [[Diving apparatus|Diving equipment]] will not help here.\n\nThe player will need to obtain 3 [[fire nerve]]s, 2 [[air nerve]]s, 2 [[earth nerve]]s, and 1 [[water nerve]] in total, and then combine them as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Nerve ending\n!Required nerves\n|-\n|{{plink|Dust nerve|txt=Dust}}\n|{{plink|Air nerve|txt=Air}} and {{plink|Earth nerve|txt=Earth}}\n|-\n|{{plink|Lava nerve|txt=Lava}}\n|{{plink|Earth nerve|txt=Earth}} and {{plink|Fire nerve|txt=Fire}}\n|-\n|{{plink|Smoke nerve|txt=Smoke}}\n|{{plink|Fire nerve|txt=Fire}} and {{plink|Air nerve|txt=Air}}\n|-\n|{{plink|Steam nerve|txt=Steam}}\n|{{plink|Water nerve|txt=Water}} and {{plink|Fire nerve|txt=Fire}}\n|}\n\n===== Summoning Circle =====\nThis room is accessed from the southernmost neural teleporter. Here, players must kill all the [[scarred imp]]s, who are providing protection Prayers to the lesser demons in the centre. The lesser demons will also summon [[scarred lesser demon]]s and [[scarred hellhound]]s to deter the player, both of which can hit through protection Prayers. Focus on the imps and lesser demons; once they are killed, any summoned demons are killed as well. Summoned enemies can be kited around the summoning circle to avoid damage.\n\nAfter completing all three rooms, this level of The Scar will be fully disturbed, allowing players to enter the passage containing the shipwreck.

A [[gooey note]] and [[slimy tablet]] can be found as well, indicated on the map to the right.\n\n===== Abyssal Stem =====\nHere, players must dive in and touch the abyssal stem, then observe the order in which abyssal growths glow and touch them in the same order. Players cannot use diving equipment to keep their oxygen levels up; air bubbles in the room will replenish it instead.\n\n===== Brain Pillar =====\nThis room is found right next to portal B. Here, players must defend the [[Abyssal antibody|abyssal antibodies]] from the [[scarred hellhound]]s and [[scarred lesser demon]]s until the brain pillar is fully healed. The attackers will only ever attack the antibodies; ignore protection prayers and Defence, and simply focus on killing the waves of scarred monsters as fast as possible. If all abyssal antibodies are killed, the player will be ejected from the room and take significant damage. Leaving early to reset the room if too many abyssal antibodies are killed early on may be preferred.\n\n===== Unlit Veins =====\nThe last room is accessed by using the blue neural teleporter - which can be accessed via the Brain Pillar room (shown as B on the map to the right), then running east to the green neural teleporter (shown as A), then using it and running north.\n\nIn the Unlit Veins room, you must take four [[illuminating lure]]s from the [[light leech]]es (you may fail and the leeches will attack with Melee - you may wish to pray Protect from Melee), then lighting all four of the damaged growth. Once the room lights up, the [[Crimson Vein|Crimson]] and [[Radiant Vein|Radiant Veins]] will appear. To repair them, you must use [[crimson fibre|crimson]] and [[radiant fibre]] on the veins, which are acquired from killing [[crimson sanguisphera|crimson]] and [[radiant sanguisphera]]. These use very accurate blood spells that heal them, so use [[Protect from Magic]] to kill them quick. You will need to kill three of each.\n\nAfter completing all three rooms, this level of The Scar will be fully disturbed, allowing players to enter the passage containing the shipwreck. Search for the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Item\n!Location\n|-\n|{{Plink|Tinderbox}}\n|Crate in south-east corner\n|-\n|{{Plink|Gunpowder (Desert Treasure II)|txt=Gunpowder}}\n|Skeleton in the south-east corner\n|-\n|{{Plink|Slimy key}}\n|Skeleton in the north-west corner\n|-\n|{{Plink|Damp tablet|pic=Damp tablet (1)}}{{efn|The chest in the first passage to be visited will contain an [[Old tablet]] instead.}}\n|The chest in the south end of the room\n|}\n{{notelist}}\n'''The tablet must be acquired and read before the ship can be burned.'''\n\n==== North-west passage ====\n''Monsters here will attack with '''ranged'''''.[[File:Desert Treasure II - the Scar level 3.png|thumb|350px|A map of the third level of The Scar.]]\nEntering the north-west passage will bring to player to the north-west part of the '''third level''', by the [[File:Dungeon icon.png]] on the minimap. A [[gooey note]] and [[slimy tablet]] can be found as well, indicated on the map to the right.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nDesert Treasure II - the Scar abyssal tether.png|The Abyssal Tether.\nDesert Treasure II - the Scar catalyst.png|The Catalyst.\nDesert Treasure II - the Scar damaged growth.png|The Damaged Growth.\n</gallery>\n\n===== Abyssal Tether =====\nHere, you must reach the Abyssal Tether at the end of the maze. At all times in this room, you must remain on the 3x3 platform of dots surrounding a pathbreaker. While staying on the platforms, you must move the cerebral orbs while remaining adjacent to the moving orb until it is close enough to the next platform to move to the next platform without stepping off of the grids surrounding the pathbreakers. Leaving the platforms will result in you being electrocuted, dealt 5–10 damage, and sent back to the beginning of the maze.\n\n[[Cerebral pathfinder]]s (green) will travel in the direction you are facing when you hit them, and [[cerebral pathbreaker]]s (red) travel in the opposite direction from where you hit them. Ensure that run is turned off for this section, and make your way through the maze:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Step\n!Cerebral orb type\n!Push from the\n!Move to the\n|-\n|1\n|{{Ilink|Cerebral pathfinder|pic=Cerebral pathfinder|size=16}}\n|North\n|South\n|-\n|2\n|{{Ilink|Cerebral pathfinder|pic=Cerebral pathfinder|size=16}}\n|West\n|East\n|-\n|3\n|{{Ilink|Cerebral pathfinder|pic=Cerebral pathfinder|size=16}}\n|North\n|South\n|-\n|4\n|{{Ilink|Cerebral pathbreaker|pic=Cerebral pathbreaker|size=16}}\n|West\n|West\n|-\n|5\n|{{Ilink|Cerebral pathbreaker|pic=Cerebral pathbreaker|size=16}}\n|East\n|East\n|-\n|6\n|{{Ilink|Cerebral pathbreaker|pic=Cerebral pathbreaker|size=16}}\n|South\n|South\n|}\n\n===== Catalyst =====\nThe next room is the Catalyst, accessed quickly by using the green neural teleporter in the north-east corner. Players must break the nerve endings around the area, and use them on the catalyst with the matching rune symbol to disrupt it. Players can combine the base (elemental) nerves based on the symbol displayed on the catalyst. If players find themselves unsure of which of the combined nerves remain, they can also use the base nerves on the catalyst as well when the correct rune is shown, although this will do less damage to the catalyst.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Nerve ending\n!Required nerves\n!Elemental nerves from scratch\n|-\n|{{Ilink|Smoke nerve|pic=Smoke nerve}}\n|{{plink|Fire nerve|txt=Fire}} and {{plink|Air nerve|txt=Air}}\n|{{plink|Fire nerve|txt=Fire}} x1, {{plink|Air nerve|txt=Air}} x1\n|-\n|{{Ilink|Blood nerve|pic=Blood nerve}}\n|{{plink|Mind nerve|txt=Mind}} and {{plink|Water nerve|txt=Water}}\n|{{plink|Mind nerve|txt=Mind}} x1, {{plink|Water nerve|txt=Water}} x1\n|-\n|'''{{Ilink|Soul nerve|pic=Soul nerve}}'''\n|{{plink|Mind nerve|txt=Mind}} x2\n|{{plink|Mind nerve|txt=Mind}} x2\n|-\n|'''{{Ilink|Nature nerve|pic=Nature nerve}}'''\n|{{plink|Water nerve|txt=Water}} and {{plink|Earth nerve|txt=Earth}}\n|{{plink|Water nerve|txt=Water}} x1, {{plink|Earth nerve|txt=Earth}} x1\n|-\n|'''{{Ilink|Cosmic nerve|pic=Cosmic nerve}}'''\n|{{plink|Soul nerve|txt=Soul}} and {{Ilink|Nature nerve|pic=Nature nerve|txt=Nature}}\n|{{plink|Mind nerve|txt=Mind}} x2, {{plink|Water nerve|txt=Water}} x1, {{plink|Earth nerve|txt=Earth}} x1\n|-\n|'''{{Ilink|Astral nerve|pic=Astral nerve}}'''\n|{{plink|Cosmic nerve|txt=Cosmic}} and {{plink|Earth nerve|txt=Earth}}\n|{{plink|Mind nerve|txt=Mind}} x2, {{plink|Water nerve|txt=Water}} x1, {{plink|Earth nerve|txt=Earth}} x2\n|-\n|'''{{Ilink|Wrath nerve|pic=Wrath nerve}}'''\n|{{Ilink|Smoke nerve|pic=Smoke nerve|txt=Smoke}} and {{plink|Blood nerve|txt=Blood}}\n|{{plink|Fire nerve|txt=Fire}} x1, {{plink|Air nerve|txt=Air}} x1, {{plink|Mind nerve|txt=Mind}} x1, {{plink|Water nerve|txt=Water}} x1\n|}\n\n'''Warning:''' Leaving any item on the ground when completing this room will move the items to another instance and make them unobtainable; don't drop anything you're not willing to leave behind.\n\n===== Damaged Growth =====\nThis room is accessed quickly by using the blue neural teleporter in the west corner and then running southwards. Here, you must take four [[illuminating lure]]s from the [[light leech]]es (you may fail) whilst being under attack by them, so use Protect from Melee. After lighting all four damaged growth, the room will light up in the centre showing runic energies, which you must touch in the correct order. You have to return to each energy as you get the order, so for instance when one turns white, try another energy. If the next one does not turn white, return to the first one that turned white, once you get that second white that too will need to stay white to move on to the next colour. (for example; if you get Law Energy first, that must stay white, if you try earth and it doesn't turn white you will have to go back to Law Energy before proceeding).\n\nAfter completing all three rooms, this level of The Scar will be fully disturbed, allowing players to enter the passage containing the shipwreck. Find the following in the room where the shipwreck is:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Item\n!Location\n|-\n|{{Plink|Tinderbox}}\n|Crate in south-east corner\n|-\n|{{Plink|Gunpowder (Desert Treasure II)|txt=Gunpowder}}\n|Skeleton in the south-west corner\n|-\n|{{Plink|Slimy key}}\n|Skeleton in the north-west corner\n|-\n|{{Plink|Damp tablet|pic=Damp tablet (1)}}{{efn|The chest in the first passage to be visited will contain an [[Old tablet]] instead.}}\n|Chest between the ship wreckage\n|}\n{{notelist}}\n'''The tablet must be acquired and read before the ship can be burned.'''\n\n===Laying-off the Leviathan===\n{{Main|The Leviathan/Strategies}}\nOnce all three ships have been burnt, you will be spat back out to where Persten is. Exit The Scar and prepare to fight [[The Leviathan]]. Once prepared, return to the rowboat in The Scar and select travel. Climb up the rocks (handholds) in the landing area when ready. \n\nA short cutscene will occur where you will encounter a [[The Leviathan?|weak snake-like creature]], only for it to be eaten and the genuine monster to appear. \n\nThe Leviathan uses all three combat styles. It attacks by launching coloured orbs at the player. These do not deal damage until impact, so a player with late reactions can block them in time. It is highly recommended to stay out of melee distance of the boss during this time, as it will also utilise a powerful bite attack which cannot be reacted to prematurely. Both the melee orb and bite deal significantly more damage than the ranged and magic orbs.\n\nThe Leviathan is weak to ranged and should be used throughout the fight. Also make sure to be on the ancient spellbook as [[Shadow spells]] are essentially mandatory for the boss, as the boss has a unique mechanic in which both the speed of the orbs and how fast they're launched increases after every attack sequence; at its highest speed, it will attack in 1-tick intervals, and players likewise have 1 tick to react to it, which will most likely kill them.\n\n[[File:Fighting the Leviathan.png|thumb|300px|The player fights the Leviathan.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Regular attacks\n!Orb\n!Colour\n!Pray\n|-\n|[[File:Leviathan magic attack.png|frameless|width=90x90]]\n|'''Blue'''\n|{{Ilink|Protect from Magic|pic=Protect from Magic|size=23}}\n|-\n|[[File:Leviathan ranged attack.png|frameless|width=90x90]]\n|'''Green'''\n|{{Ilink|Protect from Missiles|pic=Protect from Missiles}}\n|-\n|[[File:Leviathan melee orb.png|frameless|width=90x90]]\n|'''Orange'''\n|{{Ilink|Protect from Melee|pic=Protect from Melee|size=25}}\n|-\n|[[File:Leviathan boulder.png|frameless|width=90x90]]\n|'''Rocks'''\n|None; run away from shadows\n|}\nUsing shadow spells on the boss will stun it for 15 ticks (9 seconds), during which the player should run behind the boss and attack it from there to deal high damage. Be aware, however, that this will cause it to perform a special attack:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Special attacks\n!Attack\n!Description\n!Action\n|-\n|'''Lightning barrage'''\n|A zone of electricity will appear around the boss.\n|Run in a circle to stay ahead of the electricity. \n'''Stand as close to the boss as possible while doing this.'''\n|-\n|'''Boulder rain'''\n|10 boulders will fall around the player, taking two ticks to land.\n|Move away from the tiles with shadows.\n|-\n|'''Smoke blast'''\n|Immediately after boulder rain, a blast of smoke will be launched.\n|Hide behind any of the boulders '''''that were launched during the last attack.''''' \nRegular boulders will not block the attack.\n|}\n\nAt 20% health, the Leviathan will enter an enrage phase; during this phase, shadow spells will no longer stun it. A moving [[abyssal pathfinder]] will also spawn in a corner of the arena. The boss' attacks will now begin to pierce prayers unless the player is standing near the pathfinder. Additionally, standing near the pathfinder will grant the player's attacks perfect accuracy and increase their minimum hit to 20% of their max hit.\n\nAfter defeating the Leviathan, climb down the handholds to the north-east and cross the stepping stone to reach Perseriya's ship. Upon arrival, [[Wizard Persten]] will row out to join you. You both will find out that Imperium, the artefact mentioned in the [[damp tablet|damp]] and [[old tablet]]s, was found by a crewmember in Perseriya's private cabin, despite the tablets claiming that it had been \"safely delivered to the east\".\n\nOnce Persten leaves, search the nearby debris to retrieve [[Perseriya's medallion]]. Take it to the Ancient Vault and place it on her statue in the south-east corner.\n\n==Duke Sucellus of the Sixth Legion==\n{{Needed|Melee combat gear, food, [[combat potions]] for lower levels, a method of restoring 50 or so [[Prayer]] points.|recommended=[[Icy basalt]], [[stamina potion]], three or more free inventory spaces.}}\nAs you begin this section, note that all your items will be temporarily removed while you're in the prison. When you're ready, head to the [[Ghorrock Prison]], located below Weiss, in the salt mine, and enter the heavy door in the north-eastern room. You will be interrupted by [[Captain Malleta]], who you'll convince to let you in. However, you will be knocked out and teleported into a cell upon entry.\n\n===Between Ghorrock and a Hard Place===\nInspect the wall in the north side of the cell to hear a mysterious voice. He will tell you that he is one of [[General Khazard]]'s soldiers who couldn't mind his own business, so he was locked in a cell next to yours. He'll ask that you try and find something that may help the both of you escape. Search the skeleton for a [[prisoner's letter]], which indicates that something is in the latrine bucket; search it to obtain a [[Knife (Desert Treasure II)|knife]]. Give it to the soldier, who will use it to obtain a [[Chisel (Desert Treasure II)|chisel]], which he gives to you. Next, search the bed, where you'll use the chisel to pry out the loose slab of stone under it for a [[Lockpick (Desert Treasure II)|lockpick]]. Though you can't use it to unlock your own cell, give it to the soldier, who will free you after he frees himself.\n\nAfter leaving your cell, talk to the soldier, who you realise is actually the [[Assassin]] you encountered during [[Secrets of the North]]. He will tell you that [[Jhallan]] was the one who imprisoned him, and that he needs to search the asylum for something, which is also where you need to go. He will propose that you find the key to the cell containing your items, while he searches for a way to reach the asylum. He will then give you back the lockpick and disappear.\n\n====Sapphire key====\nThroughout the prison, you will find crates with [[Rations (Desert Treasure II)|rations]]. These act similarly to the [[scarred scraps]] from your adventures in [[The Scar]]. The crates reset over time so you can use them to stock up.\n\nIf you logout you will be returned to the prison entrance but you will not have to repick locks that have already been unlocked.\n[[File:Ghorrock Prison map.png|thumb|450px|A detailed map of the prison.]]\nYou will need to search for several keys to unlock gates throughout the prison. Using the map, point Y is where the Assassin left you. Make your way to point L, where you'll need to use a lockpicking interface to open it. This will be the same as the one found when defending Kasonde, but this time it has six tumblers; use the brute force method to unlock it. Take the south path and make your way around, looping south, to the east entrance of the refugee camp.\n\nOpen the southern gate and enter the room with the altar. Search it for a [[warning letter]], which hints towards the passcode to the chest in the south-east corner. Around the room will be six candle stands with a flag hanging behind them. The number of strokes on the symbol of each banner varies; for example, the north-east candle holder has '''two''' candles on it, with the flag having '''one''' stroke. This indicates that the number '''2''' is the '''first''' digit of the passcode. Following the others, the passcode can then be figured out as '''214013''', which gives you the [[Sapphire key (Desert Treasure II)|sapphire key]]. Logging out will now return you to this room.\n\n====Emerald key====\nMake your way back to the main block, and open the sapphire gate directly north. From here, make your way to the Administration room - the north-western most room on the map - which has a grid of chests. Search the crate in the north-east corner for a [[requisition note]] and [[grid note]]. The capitalised letters of the requester's names in the requisition note spell out \"VIAL\", while the grid note indicates the locations of the first letter of the items inside the chests. The grid is correctly oriented when the player is facing west, as the top-right square of the grid (marked \"H\") corresponds to the north-westernmost chest. Thus, by filling in the blank slots in the grid note, the chest containing vials would be found in the '''first row''' and '''third column''' (directly in front of the west door).\n\nThe chest is locked with a passcode, which can be figured out by looking at the identifier column of the requisition note. The first digit indicates the row, and the second the column, so the first letter of the passcode would be found at the second row and fourth column, which is '''L''' (for Lanterns). Following the others, the passcode can then be figured out as '''LIES''', which gives you the [[Emerald key (Desert Treasure II)|emerald key]].\n\n====Ruby key====\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - hunted by Jhallan.png|thumb|300px|The player is pursued by [[Jhallan]].]]\nFrom this point, [[Jhallan]] will begin to pursue you after you exit the room. Though using Protect from Magic reduces the damage he deals, entering any room will cause him to teleport away. If he manages to kill you, you will respawn back in the room with the emerald key.\n\nRun down the eastern passage into a small room with a blocked crevice. Unblock it and enter the next room, then enter the room with seven beds in it. Search the crate in the south-east corner to receive a [[code converter]] and a [[magic lantern]]. Attempt to open the seven chests that are next to the beds, which will give you the names of seven people: Vedius, Grazon, Phalina, Marcus, Nithrak, Baelys, and Atreus. Note down their locations, then stand next to the exit and equip the magic lantern, where you'll see a purple arrow pointing outside. Follow the arrows, where you'll also see coded letters appear; using the code converter, the entire route will spell out the letters '''AGVMNBP''' - the initials of the seven names you saw earlier.\n\nBy mapping out the movement from each chest to the next (eg. Grazon's chest is to the north of Arteus'), the passcode of the chest in the south-east corner can then be figured out as '''UP RIGHT LEFT DOWN RIGHT UP''', which gives you the [[Ruby key (Desert Treasure II)|ruby key]].\n\n====Diamond key====\nReturn to the Main Block, and open the ruby gates to the south-west. Make your way to the cell with the locked chest, and search the bed for a [[library note]] and [[strange slider]]. The note instructs you to look for books written by Duke Quirinius in the library, and also to remember the phrase \"Various people emerged near us\" (taking only the first letter of each word, this spells '''VPENU'''). Make your way to the library in the administration section of the prison, where the ruby gate is.\n\nSearching all the bookcases in the library will result in you finding three books by Duke Quirinius: ''Innocence'', ''Longing'', and ''Harmonious''. Notably, the location of ''Innocence'' is equally spaced between ''Longing'' and ''Harmonious'', hinting that the sequence on the strange slider should have the letter I on the bottom equally spaced between the letters H and L on the top based on the orientation of the bookcases. Lastly, by looking at the top letters of the phrase from the library note ('''VPENU'''), you will find that the bottom letters spell out the passcode of the locked chest as '''WRATH''', which gives you the [[diamond key]].\n\n===Distracting Jhallan===\nReturn to the main block and talk to the Assassin on the west side. You will demand answers from him before you open the diamond gate, and he'll oblige, telling you that he was paid by someone to look for the Frostenhorn, the artefact [[Dr Banikan]] was searching on the [[Golem (Desert Treasure II)|golem machine]] in the military installation. He also admits to framing the Hazeel Cult for breaking into the Carnillean Mansion, and resurrecting Hazeel (if the player didn't do so during the [[Hazeel Cult]] quest), as it made the motives believable. Satisfied, you can now enter the cell and open the chest to recover your items. The Assassin will tell you that while you were busy, he has found a way into the asylum, but will need to deal with [[Jhallan]] before going there. He will ask you to light a pack of firecrackers he left in the refugee camp to attract his attention. Search the pack next to the centre pillar and light it up. You do not need open inventory spaces to light the fireworks and any items on the ground will despawn when you do.\n\nYou now need to survive for three minutes until the Assassin arrives. Due to his Mahjarrat status, Jhallan is nigh-invincible and attacking him is not recommended. Occasionally, you will be teleported to him and become frozen, and shadows will converge on your location, at which point you should rapidly click away to escape. Part-way through, some shadow clones of Jhallan will also spawn; they will not follow you if you run behind the pillar, but can pile on if you stay in melee range. If you remain in place when the illusions first spawn, you can take heavy damage.\n\nNote that it is possible to kill the illusions by attacking them in the order in which Jhallan summons them (they have one health each), but not necessary. Players struggling with the damage can bring [[Strawberries|baskets of strawberries]] or other high-healing food that's spread out across several bites, such as [[Pizza|pizzas]], to survive without overhealing. A Prayer potion is helpful here, as is a stamina, although it is possible to do without them if players get lucky with their spawns.\n\nOnce three minutes are up, a short cutscene will play where [[Jhallan]] is frozen by way of [[Ice Barrage]]. The Assassin will then appear and tell you that the asylum entrance is now open. If you did not bring combat equipment and supplies before coming here, leave and do so, as you will face Duke Sucellus.\n\n===Duking it Out===\n{{Main|Duke Sucellus/Strategies}}\nThe fight will require a [[pestle and mortar]] and a pickaxe; both of these can be found in the boss arena, though a better pickaxe will result in faster mining.\n\nBefore fighting [[Duke Sucellus]], you will need to wake him up by creating two [[arder-musca poison]]s from resources found in the room. Up the stairs on both sides of the chamber, there are [[Extremity|extremities]] that periodically open their eyes and emit a red gaze, which will freeze you and deal a very large amount of damage. Each of the extremities opens their eyes in succession, after which there is a brief period of rest, allowing you to run past. Watch the extremities to see which one opens their eye first, and then let the other two open theirs as well, and '''immediately''' after seeing the last of the three close its eye, run past to the mushrooms. Alongside this, you must also avoid the ice fall attacks, which emit from the floor and are indicated by a looming shadow on the ground. At the end of the path, if you have at least 80 [[Herblore]], pick two [[Arder mushroom|arder]] and two [[musca mushroom]]s; if not, pick three of both. Use your pestle and mortar on the mushrooms, and you will end up with at least 12 of each powder.\n\nOn the sides of the arena in front of the Duke are salt deposits which you must mine for 12 [[salax salt]]. Lastly, fill the fermentation vats with the ingredients and then empty it to retrieve the [[arder-musca poison]]s. Note that this can be accomplished in any order. When ready, use both potions on Duke Sucellus to begin the fight. Alternatively, you can simply grind the mushrooms and feed it to Sucellus; each powder inflicts 5 damage to him.\n\n'''Note:''' Teleporting out will remove ingredients and potions from inventory.\n[[File:Fighting Duke Sucellus.png|thumb|300px|The player fights Duke Sucellus.]]\n[[Duke Sucellus]] has several attacks, most of which deal a lot of damage if they hit you:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Attack name\n!Description\n!Priority\n|-\n|'''Magic orb'''\n|When out of melee range, Sucellus will fire a blue orb. Protect from Magic reduces damage, but players are advised to attack him with melee, pray against melee, and tank the magic hits should they come.\n|Lowest\n|-\n|'''Slam'''\n|When in melee range, Sucellus will slam his arms on the floor, summoning spikes of ice on every tile directly adjacent to him. The spikes can deal up to 12 damage, and Sucellus' melee hits can deal upwards of 30. Protect from Melee is advised.\n|Low\n|-\n|'''Acid gas'''\n|Sucellus will launch a projectile towards one of the vents (two later in the fight), causing it to emit gas which deals rapid damage every game tick the player stands next to it. As soon as the gas emerges, run to the pillar on the other side of the room while avoiding standing on any tile that's directly adjacent to Sucellus.\n|High\n|-\n|'''Freezing gaze'''\n|Every 6 attacks,  Sucellus will open his eye and unleash his gaze upon you. '''You MUST stay behind one of the pillars closest to you as soon as this happens.'''\n|'''Highest'''\n|}\nSucellus is best defeated through melee, as he is weakest to slash attacks. Arclight is particularly effective, though while he is a demon, demonbane weapons are only 70% effective, so players with a [[scythe of vitur]] should use that instead. If available, bring any defence draining weapon as Sucellus has very high Defence. \n\nSince accuracy is less important here, Strength-boosting gear will help improve damage per second. Players should bring their strongest melee style and stand directly behind one of the two pillars closest to him. Every time Sucellus uses his slam attack, <u>as soon as his arms hit the ground,</u> hit him once and immediately run back behind the pillar before the icicles shatter, as if you were [[flinching]] him. You will take chip damage from the icicles initially spawning, but with high-healing food such as Karambwan, the fight is very manageable, even at mid-level melee stats. Upon reaching 25% of his health, Sucellus will enter an \"enrage\" state and attack one tick faster.\n\n===== Note for pures =====\nFor players that don't use melee, Sucellus can be defeated in the same style as above by clicking the ground to manually put yourself in melee range, attacking once with a fast weapon such as a blowpipe, and returning behind the pillar. While more click-intensive, it's very possible to complete a kill with minimal additional damage. Since his attacks are very accurate (even when using high defence gear), it is best to bring armour with prayer or strength bonuses instead.\n\nAfter defeating Duke Sucellus, take the [[odd key]] that he drops and enter the room on the west side of the main hallway. Talk to the assassin and open the chest in the corner to receive [[Sucellus' medallion]], then take it to the Ancient Vault and place it on his statue in the south-west corner.\n\n==The Whisperer==\n{{Needed|[[Combat gear]] (preferably magic), [[ring of visibility]], [[food]], [[potions]].|recommended=Runes or tablets for [[Mind Altar Teleport|Mind altar]] or [[Lassar Teleport|Lassar]] teleports, [[stamina potion]], at least 8 free inventory spaces.}}\n[[File:Prescott chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nMake your way to the [[Ruins of Camdozaal]]. Once inside, speak to [[Ramarno]] at the [[Sacred Forge]] to the north (if you have not previously talked to him, he will instead be at the entrance), talk to him and then talk to him at the forge. Ask him if he's seen any other archaeologists in the area, and he will tell you that some arrived recently, and points you towards the bank chest slightly south-east from him. Head to the chest and speak to [[Prescott]], the head archaeologist; he will tell you that he's found several non-dwarven artefacts, including a particularly strange icon. He will then mention add that he hasn't returned to the place he found it, due to hearing strange voices from the large sinkhole. You'll ask him about going down there, and he'll commend your bravery and give you a [[very long rope]] to use.\n[[File:Lassar Undercity quest map.png|thumb|500px|A detailed map of the undercity.]]\nHead west of Ramarno and then north into the [[Camdozaal Mines]], until you reach the sinkhole. Attach the very long rope on the rock with the \"attach-rope\" option, and you'll climb down and find yourself in the [[Lassar Undercity]].\n\n=== Ruin Scape ===\nThroughout the undercity, you will see transportation icons ([[File:Transportation icon.png]]) on the map; these are [[teleporter]]s that allow easy navigation of the area, and should be activated whenever you first pass by them. There are also [[Strange Pool|Strange Pools]] around the undercity that can restore the player's [[run energy]].\n\nMake your way to the Science District in the south-west. In the north-western building, marked by two [[File:Water source icon.png]] icons, take the [[shadow blocker schematic]] and the [[Shadow key#Green|green shadow key]], then take the [[Shadow key#Purple|purple shadow key]] from the building south of the one you were in. Head north-east towards the Residential District, then south towards the Sunken Cathedral. You will faint and reappear in the house of [[Ketla]], an [[Imcando dwarf]]. She will tell you that a shadowy entity was responsible for your blackout, and that it must be stopped by breaking the totem that links the real world with the [[Shadow Realm]].\n\nYou will mention your [[ring of visibility]], which she will then ask to see. After showing it to her, she will tell you that it is useless on its own, only letting you view a small glimpse of the Shadow Realm, but that she has a shard from the totem that can allow you to actually enter the Shadow Realm completely: the [[blackstone fragment]]. Ketla believes the totem is located in the Sunken Cathedral, to which the entrance is blocked by shadows. She will then give you the fragment, and tell you that you must destroy the totem.\n\nGive the [[shadow blocker schematic]] you picked up earlier to her, and she will make you a [[shadow blocker]]. Whenever the player gives her new schematics, the devices she builds can be picked up by searching her workbench.\n\n===Seeing Shadows===\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - staying sane.png|thumb|300px|Standing next to the shadow blocker in the Shadow Realm will ensure players stay sane, no matter how many voices they hear in their head.]]\nPlayers will now need to find schematics and shadow keys throughout the undercity, which involve going in and out of the Shadow Realm using the [[blackstone fragment]]. The Shadow Realm can be entered by using black puddles found throughout the undercity; Upon entry, a [[sanity]] meter will be displayed that reduces by 1 every [[tick]], and is further depleted by 8-10 by the [[Lost Soul]]s in the area. Should a player lose their sanity completely, they will begin taking damage at a rapid pace; players can use the blackstone fragment to instantly depart from the Shadow Realm, at which point their sanity will restore by 10% every tick.\n\n'''Note:''' If you die in the Shadow Realm your items can be retrieved from your grave in the Ruins of Camdozaal where you placed the rope to initially get into the Lassar Undercity.\n\nIn addition, there are bright, white [[remnant]]s scattered throughout the Shadow Realm. All but one are optional to touch during the quest, and touching some of them will result in a [[Shadow Keeper|shadow keeper]] attacking you. Thus, it is recommended not to touch these until you have acquired the [[shadow blocker]] later in this section.\n\nThe first of the schematics will be the [[basic shadow torch schematic]], found in the middle of the Science District (the building with the furnaces). Enter the building, then place the shadow blocker next to the locked doors. Next, enter the Shadow Realm from the black puddle nearby and unlock the doors with the purple key; this is a slow process. As long as you are adjacent to the shadow blocker, your sanity will not be lowered. Once the doors are unlocked, head to the north room and pick up the schematic. Use the [[blackstone fragment]] to leave the Shadow Realm, then right-click \"Recall\" on it to retrieve your shadow blocker. Use the nearest teleporter and select the Western Residential District as your destination. Bring the schematic to [[Ketla]] and retrieve the [[basic shadow torch]].\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - burning tentacles.png|thumb|300px|Stronger shadow torches are needed to burn away some of the tentacles.]]\nThe next schematic you'll need is the [[revitalising idol schematic]], found in the large building east of the black puddle in the Residential District. Enter the Shadow Realm, destroy the tentacles at the south-east entrance, and either enter the building in the Shadow Realm or the real world to retrieve the schematic. Before returning to Ketla, open the door in the real world and run east to activate the last teleporter, then use it to teleport to the Western Residential District. Give the schematic to her and retrieve the [[revitalising idol]].\n\nAs the basic torch is not strong enough to destroy any of the other tentacles, the next schematic needed is the [[superior shadow torch schematic]]. Use the nearby  teleporter to teleport to the Eastern Residential District, then place the revitalising idol directly next to the teleporter. Enter the Shadow Realm from the same place as with the idol schematic, and then run and touch the revitalising idol, which will restore 50% of your sanity. From here, run north until you reach the drain, and run west and around until you are at a door with tentacles. Destroy the tentacles and open the door, and pick up the [[Shadow key#Blue|blue shadow key]] in the north-west corner of the building. If your sanity is running low after destroying the tentacles, you may retrieve the shadow key in the real world instead. Next, head to the '''western''' building (next to the Western Residential District teleporter) and place the shadow blocker next to the entrance, then enter the Shadow Realm and picklock the doors. Once the doors are unlocked, enter and pick up the schematic. Give the schematic to Ketla for the [[superior shadow torch]].\n\nThe next item you'll need is the [[anima portal schematic]]. Recall your devices via the blackstone fragment, then enter the Shadow Realm via the Science District (Northern teleporter). Make your way around the north-western building, climb the stairs to the north of the building, destroy the tentacle, and then pick up the schematic and return to the real world. Give the schematic to Ketla for the [[anima portal]].\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - device placement for chest.png|thumb|300px|An ideal placement of devices for the last schematic.]]\nThe last schematic available in the undercity is the [[perfected shadow torch schematic]]. Teleport to the Plaza (between the palace and the residential district) and enter the Shadow Realm from there, then head south down the stairs and destroy the tentacles at the building (has two water sources in it and a teleporter right outside). Return to the real world, and enter the building, making your way west to the outside area where you'll find the [[Shadow key#White|white shadow key]]. Exit the building and teleport to the Palace. If you left any devices placed somewhere, recall them all via the blackstone fragment.\n\nHead to the north-west corner of the Palace, where you'll see a locked chest. Place the shadow blocker in front of the chest, the anima portal between the two braziers, and the revitalising idol several tiles south-east of the anima portal. Enter the Shadow Realm from the Plaza, then make your way back to the Palace. Use the revitalising idol, then light the four braziers around the chest; the anima portal will distract the lost souls while you do so. Once they are lit, they will disappear and the chest can be opened for the schematic.\n\n===The Silent Choir===\n[[File:Ketla chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nReturn to the real world, recall your devices, and give the schematic to Ketla. She will tell you that it is a fake, marked by the black hand of the [[Silent Choir]]. When you ask for more questions, she will enter a trance again, and you will break her out of it. She tells you that time is running out, and asks that you find the church of the Silent Choir, hidden somewhere in the city.\n\nEnter the Shadow Realm from the Residential District, and run to the building with the pub icon ([[File:Pub icon.png]]) where you obtained the superior shadow torch schematic. Head upstairs and touch the [[remnant]] in the north-eastern room; while going through the dialogue your sanity will not deplete, and you will not need to fight any demons, unlike other remnants. You will discover after touching the remnant that the church is found in the cistern below, and that you'll need some sort of icon to reach them.\n\nReturn to the real world, and reenter the Shadow Realm once your sanity is replenished. Burn the tentacles from the doors of the southern building next to the Cathedral teleporter, and then the tentacles from the other building just west. Return to the real world and pick up the final [[Shadow key#Red|shadow key]] from the south-western rectangular building. Head inside the square building, and then place the shadow blocker by the chest and picklock it from within the Shadow Realm. You will acquire one half of the [[icon segment]]. For the other half, enter the Shadow Realm from the Science District and head south to the building next to the South Science District teleporter. Destroy the tentacle there, open the chest inside, and assemble the segments to create the [[Strange icon (Desert Treasure II)|strange icon]], which will mirror the icon shown to you by Prescott earlier in the section.\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - do you really think you can save them?.png|thumb|300px|Do you really think you can hide? Do you really think you can save them?]]\nWith the icon in tow, enter the drain in the centre of the Residential District, and go through the door in front of you and down the ladder to the east. Head to the centre of the room and inspect the ancient pillar; you will suddenly see multiple versions of yourself speaking to you, slowly surrounding you as the screen steadily fades to darkness. You will then appear in the middle of a body of water, still surrounded by hallucinations, beckoning you with the  same phrase you heard from Ketla: \"Do you really think you can save them?\"\n\nAs you cry for help, Ketla snaps you out of it, revealing that you succumbed to the darkness, and that you were able to return to reality because she destroyed the totem. Without it, the darkness cannot spread beyond the undercity, but it still remains in her. She will also tell you that she found the real schematic and has the [[perfected shadow torch]] ready for you, and that she will be leaving for a new journey away from the undercity.\n\nTake the torch from Ketla's workbench, and burn down the row of tentacles blocking the Sunken Cathedral from the Shadow Realm. Head back to the [[Ruins of Camdozaal]] and resupply, as you will be fighting [[The Whisperer]] in the next section.\n\n===Wiping Out the Whisperer===\n{{Main|The Whisperer/Strategies}}\nBefore departing, make sure to bring the [[blackstone fragment]], as you cannot start the fight without it. Bring your best magic combat gear, and also bring runes for [[ice spells]] to counter one of her attacks.\n\n[[The Whisperer]] has two primary attacks, launched in sets of three rapid-succession volleys towards the player. The projectiles will only deal damage upon hitting the player, not when they are launched. After each set of three volleys, a set of homing tentacles will convene towards where the player was standing when they first appeared, hitting players for 10 damage and draining their sanity by 10% if they make contact.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Primary attacks\n!Image\n!Description\n!Action\n|-\n|[[File:Whisperer magic attack.png|frameless|width=65x65]]\n|'''Magic volley'''\n|Pray {{Ilink|Protect from Magic|pic=Protect from Magic|size=23}}\n|-\n|[[File:Whisperer ranged attack.png|frameless|width=65x65]]\n|'''Ranged volley'''\n|Pray {{Ilink|Protect from Missiles|pic=Protect from Missiles}}\n|-\n|[[File:Whisperer tentacles.png|frameless|width=236x236]]\n|'''Homing tentacles'''\n|Run to a new tile\n|}\n[[File:Fighting the Whisperer.png|thumb|300px|The player fights the Whisperer.]]\nThe pattern of these attacks are dependent on the phases of the fight:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Whisperer volley phases\n!Phase\n!Pattern\n|-\n|One\n|One combat style used per set of volleys\n|-\n|Two\n|Both styles are used in each set of volleys, with the first two in one style and the final in the other\n|-\n|Three\n|Both styles are used in each set of volleys, with an attack in one style sandwiched between two attacks in the other style (either magic, range, magic or range, magic, range)\n|-\n|Four\n|Volley shots alternate; she starts with range, and switches every 2 attacks\n|}\nAfter depleting one-third of her health, she will unleash one of three special attacks from within the Shadow Realm; '''activate the blackstone fragment when it glows yellow.'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Shadow Realm attacks\n!Image\n!Name\n!Description\n!Method\n|-\n|[[File:Lost Soul (Mors!).png|frameless|width=138x138]]\n|'''Soul Siphon'''\n|Twelve [[Lost Soul (The Whisperer)|lost souls]] appear from which she siphons energy.

The quickest will be to kill the two yellow spirits chanting \"Vita!\". The player will have enough time to kill 5 or 6 quickly. A [[venator bow]] can kill all twelve spirits in the allotted time.\n|-\n|[[File:Corrupted seed (light green).png|frameless|width=65x65]]\n|'''Corrupted Seeds'''\n|She will set orbs around her, which appear both dark and light green colours within the Shadow Realm.

At the same time, pillars will emerge from the water, which have 20, 40, or 60 health. If the player is struck by the attack, they will take 35 damage and drains sanity by 35%.\n|Stand behind pillars to block the incoming attacks. Stay behind the weaker pillars first, then run to other remaining standing pillars.\n|-\n|\n|'''Binding Blow'''\n|After each special attack, the Whisperer will launch a binding projectile and move towards the player for ~10 tiles in an attempt to melee them.\n|The simplest method is to freeze her with an ice spell, which will stop her from moving. Alternatively standing far enough from her position when she launches the projectile will result in her giving up once she reaches the final tile.\n|}\nUpon reaching 0 health, the Whisperer will become enraged and drag the player into the Shadow Realm, restoring 100 of her health. She will have an increased attack speed and enter phase four, alternating between ranged and magic every two volley shots. Only one tentacle will appear per attack. The volley shots '''will not''' drain sanity if hit off-Prayer, but the tentacles will.\n\nAfter defeating the Whisperer, search her [[entrails]] for [[Whisperer's medallion|her medallion]]. Before heading to the [[Ancient Vault]], head to a bank and prepare for another fight in the next section.\n\n==The Desert Treasure==\n{{needed|Gear for two combat styles (Ranged and Melee recommended)|recommended=[[Food]], [[prayer potion]], stat-boosting potions. Players returning to the quarry will benefit from an [[amulet of glory]] to teleport to [[Al Kharid]], and 5 [[coins]] to buy a [[Shantay Pass]] after taking the boat to [[Unkah]].}}\n\n===Recidivism===\nUpon attempting to return the last medallion, you will be knocked unconscious by the [[Mysterious Figure]], who has rigged the vault doors with magic. You will once again be imprisoned, this time in an underground temple; search the bed for a [[Hair clip (Desert Treasure II)|hair clip]] to pick the lock on the door, then brute force the lock the same way you have done so several times before in the quest. Head to the eastern room and search the chest for your items, although the medallion will be missing. Inspect the altar in the western room and the [[Mysterious Figure]] will appear. You must now defeat her for the last medallion.\n[[File:Fighting Mysterious Figure.png|thumb|300px|Fighting the Mysterious Figure.]]\nThe Mysterious Figure is identical to her previous form in the quest. She can attack with all three attack styles, dealing up to 20 damage each time, and with fairly decent accuracy. '''Every three hits''', she will pray against the attack style you are using; for this reason, '''you need at least two attack styles to defeat her.'''\n\nEvery ten or so attacks, she will stun you with either melee ([[shove]]) or mage ([[Ice Barrage]] - this can splash). Immediately after she stuns you, she will launch a large purple orb, which can deal up to 35 typeless damage if not evaded. To avoid the orb, simply spam-click the ground away from where you were frozen; the freeze or stun will wear off two ticks before the orb lands.\n\nIt is recommended to pray [[Protect from Magic]] at all times, as her magic attack is by far the most accurate, damaging, and effective, draining your stats when it hits. Attacking her with Ranged and Melee while praying against magic attacks will give the best combination of offensive and defensive damage.\n\nShe is immune to venom, poison, and the effects of a ring of recoil.\n\nIf you need to leave mid-fight, leave via the barrier and you'll find yourself just south of the [[Desert Quarry]]. You can enter the temple again by using the same portal (it can easily be missed due to being coloured yellow). '''The barrier is the ''only'' way out. Teleportation is not possible,''' as attempting to teleport out produces the message {{Mes|A strange magical force blocks your teleport.}} Players who cannot click \"yes\" fast enough before being attacked can also choose the \"quick-leave\" option or press \"1\" to select the option to confirm leaving.\n\nAfter defeating the Mysterious Figure, bank and re-gear to prepare for the final battle.\n\n===Disputes of the Mahjarrat===\n{{Needed|recommended=Melee equipment with high ranged defence, ranged weapon swap, knives/darts, antipoison, Prayer potions, food, combat boosting potions (preferable to pre-pot then run to the fight).}}\n[[File:Azzanadra chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - the Elder Horn.png|thumb|300px|Asgarnia Smith stands before the treasure of the vault.]]\nReturn to the Ancient Vault. A cutscene will play where you and [[Asgarnia Smith]] will argue over the treasure, after which he throws a smoke bomb at you, leaving you dazed. As you come to, you will see him place the final medallion and open the way down. Follow him down into the vault, and you will find him gazing at the sight of the treasure - a massive horn. As you note the familiarity of the power it's radiating, believing it to be the Frostenhorn, [[Dr Banikan]] will appear, revealing that he not only followed you to the vault, but that he is actually [[Azzanadra]], the [[Mahjarrat]] you freed in the [[Ancient Pyramid]].\n\nAzzanadra will explain that the horn is in actuality an extremely powerful and ancient artefact known as the [[Elder Horn]], which grants absolute control, capable of subjugating entire armies without lifting a finger. You recognise this ability as that of Imperium, which Azzanadra confirms is one and the same; you then conclude that the Imperium Perseriya delivered to the east must have been a fake, and that she had always intended to seal the real Imperium in the vault. Azzanadra will then ponder about the location of the Frostenhorn, when suddenly [[Hazeel]] appears, having been hiding in the Shadow Realm before revealing himself. \n\nHazeel will inform Azzanadra that the Frostenhorn was destroyed while you were inside the [[Ghorrock Prison]], prompting [[Enakhra]] and [[Akthanakos]] to appear as well. They will tell you that they were waiting for you to open the vault, as it was sealed specifically to prevent [[Mahjarrat]] from opening it. The four of them then argue briefly, before Azzanadra senses that there is a fifth Mahjarrat inside the vault, with Akthanakos believing it to be [[Khazard]]. However, Hazeel will tell him that Khazard is elsewhere, and believes him to be hiding another Mahjarrat.\n\nEnakhra will realise that Asgarnia Smith is not who he claims to be, and fires a revealing spell at him, breaking his disguise and revealing him to be a Mahjarrat named [[Sliske]]. Sliske reveals that he had planned to take the Elder Horn from the very beginning, and had assumed the identities of [[Asgarnia Smith]], [[Mia Persten]], [[Kasonde Shaw]], [[Ketla]], and the [[Assassin]] in order to retrieve the Horn, as well as test the player's worthiness of becoming one of his wights, just like the [[Barrows brothers]]. He will then implore the Mahjarrat that their sacrificial ritual is not sustainable in the long run, and that they eventually will face extinction by their own hand. He then claims the Elder Horn will be used to break this cycle and cease future rituals, at which point Enakhra and Akthanatos will argue and begin to fight each other, and Sliske summons the Barrows brothers to distract Hazeel and Azzanadra. This leaves you to stop him, at which point he will summon the wights of the four people he disguised himself as after you.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nFile:Desert Treasure II - Mahjarrat mayhem.png|The [[Mahjarrat]] reveal themselves.\nFile:Desert Treasure II - the Serpent appears.png|[[Sliske]] the serpent-tongued appears at last.\nFile:Desert Treasure II - wight fight.png|The battle for the [[Elder Horn]] begins.\n</gallery>\n\n===Wight Club===\nYou will now need to fight all four of Sliske's wights, one at a time; if you die or leave, you will have to start from the beginning again.

Similar to the fight during [[Secrets_of_the_North#Fighting_the_Assassin|Secrets of the North]], he cannot be damaged in normal combat; in order to damage him, you must lure him towards the white smoke clouds that he throws around the room. If the Assassin stands in the pink smoke, he will heal for around 25 Hitpoints, and if you stand within them, they will damage you for around 10 damage per tick.\n\nHe will also throw bottles of poison on your current tile that are indicated by a throwing animation. He will throw either two or three in a row; they can be avoided by simply moving away from the tile with a shadow, which will appear after the bottle-throwing animation begins. The bottles will deal a high amount of damage and inflict poison; prioritise escaping them over doing further damage.\n\nThe Assassin will always perform an auto-attack almost immediately after throwing the third bottle; pray against his ranged attack using '''Protect from Missiles''', and make sure you keep your prayer topped up.\n\n====Ketla the Unworthy====\n[[File:Ketla the Unworthy chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - Ketla the Unworthy.png|thumb|300px|Quickly kill some of Ketla's shadow clones to avoid excessive damage.]]\n[[Ketla the Unworthy]] only uses ranged attacks, but she will periodically summon four or five clones of herself to attack alongside her. She follows a simple attack rotation: two auto-attacks, shadow clones, two auto-attacks, one or two charged shots, repeat.\n\nKetla's shadow clones have a max hit of 7 through Protect from Missiles. As such, it is suggested to have armour with high ranged defence, in order to preserve your supplies for the next two fights. Shortly after summoning shadow clones, a skull will appear above her (similar to a player casting [[Vengeance]]), indicating the oncoming charged shot. If her charged shot hits you, she will heal an equal amount of Hitpoints dealt by it. To evade the charged shot, quickly move behind a shadow clone and the shot will hit them instead. It's recommended to move behind one of the clones immediately after they spawn, so you don't have to risk not getting behind one in time when you see the skull appear.\n\nKetla can fire her special attack up to two times per batch of shadow clones summoned, so make sure to keep at least two of them alive to survive her charged shots. They each have one Hitpoint, so a fast attack weapon such as a blowpipe or darts will dispose of them quickly. Alternatively, one can simply tank the clones and focus on dealing damage to Ketla, as the clones will despawn upon her death. If doing this, it's recommended to focus on healing when avoiding the charged shots. Keep '''Protect from Missiles''' up throughout the fight, and drink a stamina potion if your run drops below half, so that you're prepared for the running in the next fight.\n\n====Kasonde the Craven====\n[[File:Kasonde the Craven chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - Kasonde the Craven.png|thumb|300px|Kasonde's explosions have a small area where you can stand safely.]]\n[[Kasonde the Craven]] uses both melee and range; he will use an accurate melee attack if you are near him, but will switch to a ranged attack if you keep a distance. His fight is similar to when he was alive, with a few key differences. Instead of inflicting [[venom]], his vials will inflict [[Corruption (status)|corruption]], draining 6 prayer points over the course of 12 seconds. The vials deal typeless damage in the low 30s when hit or subsequently standing on the residue. He will additionally '''not heal''' during this fight. Finally, his shockwaves attack is dramatically stronger.\n\nHis shockwave attack will cover three quarters of the arena, there will be a small section close to him where you may safely stand and continue to attack him. As soon as you see him run to the centre, run close behind him to position yourself in the section as the attack is just two ticks from starting. He will perform two or three shockwaves in a row.\n\nAs his potions will not disappear on the ground, it is important that these do not build up near the centre, or you will have no room to avoid Kasonde's explosions, which deal typeless damage in the low 30s. For this reason, it is recommended to avoid the centre area while fighting him. This additionally provides ample warning when the shockwave attack will begin as he must run farther to the centre. Use Ranged and pray '''Protect from Missiles''', running around the edges until you see him run to the centre, or use melee and pray '''Protect from Melee''', being extremely careful to step back one square when you see him throw a vial.\n\n====Persten the Deceitful====\n[[File:Persten the Deceitful chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - Persten the Deceitful.png|thumb|300px|Avoid Persten's lightning strikes and quickly destroy her wighted portal.]]\n[[Persten the Deceitful]] attacks with magic and uses two special attacks. The first is an attack where she will channel power to launch lightning strikes, indicated by looming shadows, around the area for moderate damage, hitting in the high 20s and low 30s. As her Hitpoints get lower, she will channel subsequent lightning strikes in a row, up to three.\n\nShe will also conjure a [[Wighted Portal]] that has 30 Hitpoints, which spawns [[Wighted Leech|wighted leeches]] until destroyed. She can create two at a time, and they will always be near the entrance of the room. The wighted leeches have 5 Hitpoints and move at a speed slower than walking, but attack at the same speed as darts on rapid style with 100% accuracy, dealing between 4 to 6 typeless damage.\n\nIf you're fast, you can close the portal before it spawns any leeches. A [[dragon dagger]]'s special attack can be useful for doing this quickly. Kill her with your ranged weapon swap, '''using Protect from Magic'''. If too many leeches spawn to be able to kill them all, they can be kited around the room while attacking Persten with ranged attacks. The leeches can be blocked by the duelling Mahjarrat and often lose aggression due to their slow movement.\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:Desert Treasure II - Sliske teleports the Elder Horn.png|thumb|300px|Sliske teleports away the Elder Horn.]]\nOnce the last wight is killed, Sliske will successfully teleport the [[Elder Horn]] away. Pleased with the results, he will tell you that you will make a worthy vessel, and that you will meet again in the North. Enakhra and Akthanatos will then leave to inform their other allies of this development, leaving Azzanadra and Hazeel behind. Hazeel scolds Azzanadra for not controlling his \"pet\", though Azzanadra states that Sliske always acted on his own. Nonetheless, he realises that he would have to work with the Zamorakians to stop him, though Hazeel does not confirm nor deny the idea before he leaves.\n\nAzzanadra will then apologise to you for his multiple deceptions, and comments that you are now a player in the Mahjarrat's affairs, whether you like it or not. To show his thanks, he will upgrade your [[ring of visibility]] to a [[ring of shadows]], and advises you to prepare when the time comes.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire\n|qp = 5\n|rewards = \n* Three [[ancient lamp]]s, each offering 100,000 experience in {{SCP|Attack}} [[Attack]], {{SCP|Strength}} [[Strength]], {{SCP|Defence}} [[Defence]], {{SCP|Hitpoints}} [[Hitpoints]], {{SCP|Ranged}} [[Ranged]], {{SCP|Magic}} [[Magic]], or {{SCP|Prayer}} [[Prayer]] at level 60 or above.\n* Access to [[Scar essence mine]]\n* [[Ring of shadows]]\n* The ability to wear [[ancient rings]].\n* The ability to repeat [[the Forgotten Four]] encounters as boss fights, along with the ability to challenge their [[Awakener's orb|awakened]] variants.\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name \n! class=\"unsortable\" |Unlock details \n! class=\"unsortable\" |Music track\n|-\n|[[The Vault]] \n|Unlocked upon entering the [[Ancient Vault]]\n|[[File:The Vault.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Unturned Stones]] \n|Unlocked while fighting the [[Ancient Guardian (Desert Treasure II)|Ancient Guardian]]\n|[[File:Unturned Stones.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Strangled (music track)|Strangled]]\n|Unlocked upon entering [[the Stranglewood]]\n|[[File:Strangled.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Blood Rush (music track)|Blood Rush]] \n|Unlocked during the fight with [[Vardorvis]]\n|[[File:Blood Rush (music track).ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Scar Tissue]] \n|Unlocked upon entering [[the Scar]]\n|[[File:Scar Tissue.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Colossus of the Deep]] \n|Unlocked during the fight with [[the Leviathan]]\n|[[File:Colossus of the Deep.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Prison Break (music track)|Prison Break]]\n|Unlocked upon entering the [[Ghorrock Prison]]\n|[[File:Prison Break.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Eye See You]] \n|Unlocked during the fight with [[Duke Sucellus]]\n|[[File:Eye See You.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[The Fallen Empire (music track)|The Fallen Empire]] \n|Unlocked in the [[Lassar Undercity]]\n|[[File:The Fallen Empire.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Song of the Silent Choir]] \n|Unlocked during the fight with [[the Whisperer]]\n|[[File:Song of the Silent Choir.ogg]]\n|-\n| [[A Worthy Foe]] \n|Unlocked during the fight with the [[Mysterious Figure]]\n|[[File:A Worthy Foe.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Tick Tock]] \n|Unlocked during the penultimate cutscene, before the final battle\n|[[File:Tick Tock.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Master of Puppets]]\n|Unlocked during the penultimate cutscene, before the final battle\n|[[File:Master of Puppets.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[His Faithful Servants (music track)|His Faithful Servants]] \n|Unlocked during the final battle\n|[[File:His Faithful Servants.ogg]]\n|}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 27 March 2024\n|update = Easter & Varlamore Updates\n|poll = \n|change = Players in Lassar during the quest can now reclaim lost quest items from Ketla.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 3 August 2023\n|update = Desert Treasure II - Tweaks and Drop Rates\n|change = \n* [[Strange shrine (The Stranglewood)|Strange shrines]] have been added throughout [[the Stranglewood]] to help with energy restoration during the quest.\n* [[Stink bomb]]s have been added to a new stone chest in Kasonde's hideout to assist in repelling [[strangled]] during the quest.\n* Progress in the Scar maze will now be saved.\n* A handful of notes from the [[Ghorrock Prison]] have been tweaked to be more clear in regards to the solution.\n* Locked gates in the [[Ghorrock Prison]] that require keys to open now have their names included to assist colourblind players (e.x. \"Gate\" -> \"Diamond Gate\")\n* [[Strange Pool]]s have been added throughout the [[Lassar Undercity]] to help with energy restoration during the quest.\n* The four main bosses have received some minor balancing changes, but should remain very close to how they were on release.\n* The [[Mysterious Figure]] can no longer be safespotted.\n* [[Wighted Leech]]es now always target the player.\n* The damage [[Ketla the Unworthy]] and her clones now deal has been adjusted to be closer to what was originally intended.\n* Various spelling mistakes during the quest have been fixed.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 28 July 2023\n|update = Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire\n|change = The quest now rewards three [[ancient lamp]]s instead of one.

He has fled to the west with his closest allies, but much of his army still remains. Carnifex Maximus Vardorvis is in pursuit of him.}}\n**In the [[Transcript:The original colour of the Barrows Brothers armour#To the Chaos Elemental|25th Postbag from the Hedge]], the Chaos Elemental signed its name as \"Lethe Napier Flem,\" an anagram of \"The Fallen Empire,\" the quest's subtitle.\n***Additionally, its message stated ''\"The forgotten four were there, but now they hide from the serpent. The Abyss left a scar and she was consumed, but he hid in his prison of ice. Vardorvis wanted blood, but he was strangled instead. Now at Lassar, only whispers remain. Divided but united, their essence is delighted. With all four, you will open the door. Will he find his vessel?\"''\n** Walking onto the northernmost tile near the bottomless pit in the Ruins of Camdozaal has a small chance in a Strange Voice saying {{mes|Come... Come... Come... Down into the depths... Come...}}. A letter addressed to the pit in the 25th Postbag from the Hedge recieved the response ''\"Here... In the inky depths... We languish in sorrow... Come... Come... Join our choir of shadow... Come...\"''. Both of these messages appear to have been spoken by [[the Whisperer]], with the \"choir of shadow\" likely referencing the [[Silent Choir]].\n**In the [[Transcript:Mortals heed, this chaotic letter. Come and read, you had better.#To the Chaos Elemental|30th Postbag from the Hedge]], the Chaos Elemental's poem references the four bosses encountered: \n***Where Judges fight / And trolls flaunt / The Duke feasts / In his icy haunt\n***While to the west / In strangled weeds / The Headsman waits / For blood he pleads\n*** And below the waves / Within the Scar / The Admiral drowns / In smoke and char\n*** But hidden away / Where light dies / A Whisper is heard / And shadows rise\n***So hear me now / Or face the fire / You’ll find the truth / In The Fallen Empire\n* The quest was added to the [[Quest List]] interface on 12 April 2023 with the text in grey ({{colour|#9f9f9f|Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire}}), and served as the first reveal of the quest's skill requirements. When the quest was clicked on, the usual interface opened but with the description:\n{{Cquote2|{{colour|#000080|This quest is coming soon...}}\n\n{{colour|#000080|When it releases, I can start it by investigating the}} {{colour|#800000|Ancient Vault}} {{colour|#000080|north east of}} {{colour|#800000|Nardah}}{{colour|#000080|.}}}} \n\n*Upon release, the quest set the new record for highest skill requirements in [[Firemaking]], [[Thieving]], and [[Runecraft]]. With these new requirements, Runecraft became the final non-combat skill requiring a minimum level of 60 for the quest cape, leaving only [[Attack]], [[Strength]], and [[Prayer]] requirements below the level 60 threshold.\n** The quest also included the second level 75 skill requirement, [[Firemaking]], tying [[Dragon Slayer II]]'s 75 [[Magic]] requirement for the highest required level in a quest.\n* The quest's experience reward is also the single largest experience reward of any quest, beating the previous record of 80,000 experience held by [[Slayer]] and [[Smithing]] in [[Monkey Madness II]] and Dragon Slayer II respectively, and becoming the first skill-choice reward worth 100,000 experience.\n* The quest was originally intended to reward the [[Ruinous Powers]], a new Zarosian-themed Prayer book, but they were eventually scrapped following concerns from Jagex regarding its potential to impact the long-term health of the game due to them providing an immense amount of power creep.{{CiteNews|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=13/the-future-of-the-ruinous-powers?oldschool=1|title=The Future of the Ruinous Powers|newsdate=19 June 2023}} It was then repurposed as a [[Ruinous Powers (relic)|relic]] for [[Trailblazer Reloaded League]] mode. \n**Because of this, the skill requirements for the quest were adjusted to compensate. Prior to the removal of the Ruinous Powers, the quest had additional requirements of 64 [[Mining]] and 60 Prayer. The Mining requirement was likely removed because of a pre-requisite quest, [[Making Friends With My Arm]], having 72 Mining requirement already. Additionally, the quest previously required 70 Magic and 55 [[Construction]], 5 levels lower than the requirements upon release.\n*Terry initially mistaking [[Dr Banikan]] as [[rsw:Dr_Nabanik|Nabanik]] is a reference to ''RuneScape'', which was the name Azzanadra used when disguised as a human. The name Banikan is simply an anagram of Nabanik.\n*While searching the bookcases in the [[Ghorrock Prison]]'s administration library to solve the diamond key puzzle, one of the books the player can find is titled \"The Lusty Annakarl Maid\". This is a reference to a recurring book in ''{{WP|The Elder Scrolls}}'' series of games titled \"The Lusty Argonian Maid\", which first appeared in the 2002 entry ''{{WP|The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind}}''.\n*In the Stranglewood, the concept that the vines and the infected are “a network” and disturbing the vines will also disturb the infected might have been inspired by Stranger Things and The Last of Us.\n*When the player initially introduces themselves to [[Dr Banikan]], they do so with the phrase \"Dr Banikan, I presume?\". This mirrors a famous quote supposedly said by explorer [[wikipedia:Henry_Morton_Stanley|Henry Morton Stanley]] when he found the missionary [[wikipedia:David_Livingstone#Stanley_meeting|Dr David Livingstone]] in modern Tanzania after he had lost contact with the outside world.\n*The player in ''RuneScape'' says a similar line to Nabanik in the quest [[rsw:The_Temple_at_Senntisten|The Temple at Senntisten]].\n**Using the golem to search for \"Azzanadra\" gives you extra dialogue from Dr. Banikan.\n*All four final bosses run, rather than walk and/or have long-ranged attacks, making it impossible to safespot them.\n*Desert Treasure II has a few differences from the mainline Mahjarrat quests in ''RuneScape'':\n**Jhallan is featured as an enemy throughout this quest and [[Secrets of the North]] who acts condescendingly and aggressive towards the player. In ''RuneScape'', however, he is a much calmer character who does not fight the player at all. In the quest {{RSL|The Tale of the Muspah}}, the player helps him hibernate beneath the [[Old Shrine|ritual site]] so that he may benefit from the upcoming {{RSL|Ritual of Rejuvenation}} without risking the possibility of him being sacrificed. However, his efforts would be for naught as he gets found and sacrificed anyway during the {{RSL|Ritual of the Mahjarrat}} quest.\n**Sliske's grand plan is different from the one that is featured in ''RuneScape''. Here, Sliske appears to have initially gone along with [[Azzanadra]]'s plan to communicate with [[Zaros]] (as featured in the quest {{RSL|The Temple at Senntisten}}), which would have involved the usage of the [[Frostenhorn]], the [[strange icon]], and a [[Relic (Devious Minds)|relic]] from [[Entrana]]. However, for one reason or another, Sliske decided to scrap Azzanadra's plan in favour of using the [[Elder Horn]] to stop the Rituals of Rejuvenation instead,{{CiteNPC|npc=Strange Old Man|quote=Yes! Needed it for him, but not to keep! His friend asked him to protect it, but he made a new plan, a better plan![...]The old plan is gone. We're not doing it that way. His friend won't be happy, but it was for the best!|loc=His Faithful Servants}} resulting in the destruction of the three artefacts and preventing the events of The Temple at Senntisten from ever happening in ''Old School''. Meanwhile, in ''RuneScape'', his grand plan was {{RSL|Sliske#Sliske's Grand Ascendancy|far different}} with different motives. Instead, the \"needless rituals\" plotline was actually a point made by Zamorak himself rather than Sliske in the {{RSL|Children of Mah}} quest. He would also execute his plans much later after Ritual of the Mahjarrat, rather than before the ritual even took place.\n**The assassin is actively hostile towards the player (during [[Secrets of the North]]), and appears to know some Mahjarrat magic, as evidenced by him being able to break the seal to Ghorrock Prison and freezing Jhallan during the quest, hinting to his actual personality. In ''RuneScape'', he is simply a mercenary hired by Azzanadra, who was recommended to him by one of his fellow kin, and like Jhallan, does not fight the player at all.\n**[[Asgarnia Smith]] is revealed to be one of Sliske's personas; in ''RuneScape'', he is not involved in the quest line after Desert Treasure I.\n**Sliske's wights (not including the [[Barrows brothers]]) are also different, but are the same amount that he has in ''RuneScape''. Rather than Mia Persten, the Assassin, Ketla and Kasonde, in the {{RSL|Sliske's Endgame}} quest he would have {{RSL|Akrisae the Doomed|Akrisae Kolluym}}, {{RSL|Linza the Disgraced|Linza}}, {{RSL|Nomad}} and {{RSL|Gregorovic}}. While all of Sliske's wights in ''Old School'' are different from their ''RuneScape'' counterparts, there are some notable similarities between the two groups:\n*** Both Mia Persten and Akrisae Kolluym are members of Saradominist groups (the [[Order of Wizards]] and the {{RSL|Temple Knights}}, respectively).\n*** Both Ketla and Linza were smiths.\n*** Both Kasonde and Nomad became warped by things they were researching (Kasonde's attempt to learn about the [[Old Ones]] results in him becoming infected by [[the Strangler]], while Nomad's intense research and consumption of souls in an attempt to prolong his life would lead him to become bound to the {{RSL|Soul obelisk (Soul Wars)|soul obelisk}}).\n* Unlike most boss fights which are repeatable after the quest, players will obtain kill count and drops after defeating the Forgotten Four, though the kills will not count towards their respective [[Combat Achievements]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire}}"

It is east of [[Varrock]] and can be reached by walking north-east from the [[Digsite teleport]], or east of the ruins of the [[Earth Altar]] or the [[Lumberyard teleport]]. Or it can be reached by walking west from [[Morytania]]; the closest [[fairy ring]] is {{fairycode|CKS}}.\n\nThe monk requires a new, stronger weapon for a certain group of warriors, in order to secure more victories. He wants you to make a [[bow-sword]].\n\n===A strange weapon===\n[[File:Making slender blade.gif|frame|A player using Doric's whetstone.]]\n'''''Items required:''' A [[mithril 2h sword]] and a [[bow string]].''\n\nTo make this bow-sword, take a [[mithril 2h sword]] to [[Doric]]'s house, just north of [[Falador]], and use it on the whetstone inside to make a [[slender blade]], then attach a [[bow string]] to it to make the [[bow-sword]].\n\n''It is possible to use [[temporary boosts]] ([[dwarven stout]], [[dwarven stout (m)]], [[Kovac's grog]], or [[spicy stew]]) to reach the required [[Smithing]] level of 65.''\n\nWhen you've made the bow-sword, make your way back to the monk. You can use the [[balloon transport system]] to fly from Taverley back to the Earth Altar by using a set of [[willow logs]], if you have already unlocked the [[Varrock]] destination.\n\n===A gift for Entrana===\n'''''Items required:''' The [[bow-sword]] and a [[large pouch|large]]/[[colossal pouch]].''\n\nGive the [[bow-sword]] to the Monk and he will be grateful for it; although he needs one more favour. A special ceremony is to be held on the island of [[Entrana]], though unfortunately the monk cannot attend it and he wants to give them a special present to mark the occasion.\n\nHe gives you an [[Orb (Devious Minds)|orb]] to deliver to the church in [[Entrana]]. But for the surprise to work, you must sneak into the church and not be seen entering the island. He advises using the realm of the [[Abyss]] to get to the [[Law Altar]] on [[Entrana]]; he also wants you to keep the orb in a vessel from the realm to avoid it from being damaged. To do this, hide the orb in a [[large pouch]] - thus creating an [[Large pouch (Devious Minds)|illuminated large pouch]]. A [[colossal pouch]] can also be used, but will not be destroyed like a large pouch.\n[[File:Large pouch detail.png|right|180px]]\nLarge pouches can be obtained as rewards from the [[Rewards Guardian]] at [[Guardians of the Rift]] or as drops from [[abyssal leech]]es, [[abyssal guardian|guardians]] and [[abyssal walker|walkers]] found within the [[Abyss]] or the [[Abyssal Area]]. In addition, the pouch is only dropped if you have all the pouches below it. You do not need to have the [[Runecraft]] level (50) in order for it to be dropped, but it is required to use it.\n:'''Please note:''' The ''only possible way'' to get to [[Entrana]] with the orb is through the [[Abyss]]. If you try the balloons, or [[Port Sarim]], you will be cut off when the monks or balloon assistant asks about the 'pouch and its contents'.\n\nAs usual, no other [[weapons]] or [[armour]] are allowed on [[Entrana]], so bank them before entering the Abyss. The Abyss is accessible only through a teleport from the [[Mage of Zamorak]], who is located in the [[Wilderness]] at the point where the [[River Lum]] goes underground, just north of [[Edgeville]]. Enter the Abyss to reach the Law Altar, and through it, Entrana.\n\n''If your pouch is degraded, you will be denied access into [[Entrana]] with the orb in it. Contact the [[Dark Mage (Abyss)|dark mage]], either by the [[NPC Contact]] spell or directly in the Abyss to get it repaired.''\n\n:'''Note for UIMs:''' The orb and the [[Large pouch (Devious Minds)|large pouch]] containing the orb will be lost if you try to 'bank' using a death before going to [[Entrana]]. Make sure you grind out the large pouch using gear you can store/stash or don't mind alching. Alternatively, simply do not put the orb in the pouch, then acquire a new orb after suiciding and getting the pouch back out.\n:\n:(you will also lose your large pouch)\n\n===Surprise!===\n'''''Items required:''' The [[large pouch (Devious Minds)]]''\n[[File:Devious minds - temple attack.png|thumb|220px|The assassination.]]\nOn [[Entrana]], head to the church at the heart of the island and use your large pouch on the altar. A cutscene ensues, wherein the monks are walking towards the altar to begin the ceremony, one of them holding a mysterious [[Relic (Devious Minds)|relic]], when suddenly an [[Assassin]] wielding the [[bow-sword]] teleports in, swiftly kills the monks and steals the relic! It turns out that the orb you delivered was in fact a teleportation item using ancient magic, which allowed the assassin to sneak into the holy island, unhindered.\n\nAfter the cutscene, talk to the [[High Priest (Entrana)|High Priest]], who'll forgive for it not being your fault and tells you to return to the monk at [[Paterdomus]] to investigate.\n[[File:Devious Minds - dead monk.png|thumb|220px|The dead monk at Paterdomus.]]\nOn arriving back at the [[Paterdomus Temple]], you see the [[Monk (Devious Minds)|monk]] you helped is gone, replaced by a [[Dead Monk]]. Searching the body reveals that he has been killed by powerful magic, and is not the same person you spoke to earlier.\n\nGo back to [[Entrana]] and speak with the [[High Priest (Entrana)|High Priest]] again (you can travel via [[Port Sarim]] this time if you wish). Upon hearing about the strange events, he asks you to contact [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] at the [[Falador]] park.

(Can be stolen from tea shop or there is a spawn in Taverley north of the Herbalist's store.)}}\nThere are 3 students in the [[Digsite]] who can help you with the exam answers. They will give you the answers only if you find a lost item of theirs. You do not have to write down the answers, as they are listed below.\n:'''Note:''' You can obtain the 'special' items listed below before talking to the students.\n\n===Teddy===\n[[File:Student (Teddy) chathead.png|left]]\nFrom the [[Exam Centre]], walk a little way north towards the digsite until you come to two wooden walkways. Follow the eastern walkway to the top of the small hill and search the [[Bush (The Dig Site)|bushes]] near the large urn which has a blue pattern. One of the bushes has the [[teddy]] bear in it. Once found, return it to a [[Student#Teddy|female student]] found in the north-western section of the Digsite to get the first answer. She is blonde and is wearing all purple.\n\n:'''Note:''' To speed things up a bit [[Thieving#Pickpocketing|\"steal-from\"]] the [[Digsite workman]] near the walkway until you receive an [[animal skull]] and [[specimen brush]].\n\n===Special cup===\n[[File:Student (Special cup) chathead.png|left]]\nThe [[Student#Special cup|second student]] is found on the eastern section of the Digsite. He is wearing an orange shirt, with short black hair and darker skin. After speaking to him, you find out he lost his [[special cup]]. Go to the south-eastern side of Digsite. First, find a [[panning tray]] from inside the tent near the panning point in the river. Then try to pan with it by clicking in the river. The [[panning guide]] will stop you and ask for a [[cup of tea]]([[nettle tea]] also works), give it to him. Then, pan in the river until you get the Special cup. If you get an [[uncut opal]], keep it, as you'll need one later on. Once you have found the Special cup, return it to the student.\n:'''Note:''' You can receive both [[uncut jade]]s and [[uncut opal]]s while panning. Make sure to obtain an '''opal''' if you do not have one for the next step.\n\n===Animal skull===\n[[File:Student (Animal skull) chathead.png|left]]\nThe [[Student#Animal skull|final student]] is found in the southern section of the Digsite. He has blonde hair and is wearing a green shirt. To find his lost item, players must \"steal-from\" [[Digsite workman|Digsite workmen]] until they receive an [[animal skull]]. Upon returning the lost item to the student, he will inform you of the final answer required. If you obtain a [[specimen brush]] whilst stealing from the workmen, keep it as you'll need it later in the quest.\n[[File:The Dig Site - Teddy location.png|thumb|Teddy bear location]]\n\n\n===Retaking the exams===\n{{Needed|An [[uncut opal|opal]] (cut or uncut).}}\n\n'''Note''': If the correct answer is not present in the selection given, you must have missed talking to a student. Check the quest log to find out which one, speak to them, and then try again.\n====Level 1====\n[[File:The Dig Site - Level 1 certificate.png|thumb|220px|The first certificate.]]\nAfter helping out all three students, return to the [[Exam Centre]] and speak to an Examiner. Speak to her to retake the exam. To pass it, use the answers that the students gave you:\n#Can you tell me what Earth Sciences is? - '''The study of the earth, its contents and history.'''\n#Can you tell me which people are allowed to use the digsite? - '''All that have passed the appropriate Earth Sciences exam.'''\n#Can you tell me the proper safety points when working on a digsite? - '''Gloves and boots to be worn at all times; proper tools must be used.'''\n\nIf done correctly, players will receive a [[Level 1 certificate]] and a [[trowel]].\n\n====Level 2====\n[[File:The Dig Site - Level 2 certificate.png|thumb|220px|The second certificate.]]\nTo pass the level 2 test, speak to the three students again to get the answers and return to the Examiner. The questions and answers are:\n#Can you tell me how we transport samples? - '''Samples taken in rough form; kept only in sealed containers.'''\n#What is the proper way to handle finds? - '''Finds must be carefully handled, and gloves worn.'''\n#Can you tell me the proper use for a rock pick? - '''Always handle with care; strike cleanly on its cleaving point.'''\n\nUpon passing, players receive a [[Level 2 certificate]].\n\n====Level 3====\n[[File:The Dig Site - Level 3 certificate.png|thumb|220px|The third certificate.]]\nTo pass the level 3 test, you need to speak to the three students again to obtain the answers. '''However''', the female student will want an [[uncut opal]] or [[opal]] for her help this time. Pan in the river for one if you did not receive it when you were looking for the special cup. Return to the examiner and take the last test:\n\n#Can you tell me how we prepare samples? - '''Samples cleaned, and carried only in specimen jars.'''\n#What is the proper way to use a specimen brush? - '''Brush carefully and slowly using short strokes.'''\n#Can you describe the technique for handling bones? - '''Handle bones very carefully and keep them away from other samples.'''\n\nUpon passing, players receive a [[Level 3 certificate]] and permission to dig in all levels.\n\n:'''Note: (Optional)''' Keep the certificates to show to the [[Museum Curator]] for rewards needed for [[Desert Treasure I]] and [[Recipe for Disaster]].\n\n===Ancient discovery===\n{{Needed|A [[trowel]], a [[specimen brush]], and a [[specimen jar]].}}\n[[File:Ancient talisman detail.png|left|85px]]\nGrab a [[specimen jar]] from the '''[[cupboard (specimen jar)|cupboard]]''' on the '''south wall''' inside the [[Exam Centre]]. If there is no Search option, speak to [[Terry Balando]] about the tools then search the cupboard again. Then, head back to the Digsite, and pickpocket a [[Digsite workman]] until you get a [[specimen brush]] if you haven't got one already.\n\nDig in the south western most dig site (area 5) or the northern most dig site (area 1), the sign will read \"Level 3 digs only.\" Use your [[trowel]] on the soil until you find an [[ancient talisman]]. '''This often takes many tries and can easily take several minutes to find.''' When you find the talisman, a message will be displayed in your chat, so you are very unlikely to miss the item. \n\nOnce you have the talisman, take it to [[Terry Balando]] in the Exam Centre. He will say that it's a talisman of [[Zaros]] and is impressed. Then, he will give you an [[invitation letter]], which must be shown to a [[Digsite workman]] to get permission to go down the boreholes, or private dig shafts (showing the letter to the [[Dig Site workman]] will not work).\n\n===Chemical compound===\n{{Needed|2 [[Rope]]s, [[trowel]], [[vial]], [[specimen jar]], [[pestle and mortar]], invitation letter and a [[tinderbox]].}}\n[[File:The Dig Site - Using the winch.png|thumb|220px|The north-eastern digsite, just below the level 3 digsite.]]\n[[File:Book on chemicals detail.png|left|60px]]\nThere are two [[Winch|winches]] in the [[Digsite]], in areas 3 and 4. Use your [[Invitation letter]] on a [[Digsite workman]] that's working near a winch, and then use a [[rope]] on the west winch (in area 4) to gain access to the sublevels of the Digsite.\n[[File:The Dig Site - Digsite Dungeon map.png|thumb|200px|[[Digsite Dungeon]]]]\nClimb down the rope by operating the winch (requires 10 [[Agility]]). Grab an [[arcenia root]] just north of the rope, and go slightly east until you see some large bricks blocking the way to a room to the south. \"Search\" the bricks, and then go back to the surface.\n\nHead towards the north-east winch (in area 3), a little bit south of the level 3 digsite from before. Use another rope and go down, there you will find [[Doug Deeping]]. Speak to him and ask him how you can move a large pile of rocks. He will give you a [[chest key (Digsite)|chest key]] to be used on the [[chest (Chemical powder)|chest]] in the tent where you got your [[panning tray]]. You can also grab an [[arcenia root]] here.\n\nA [[Book on chemicals]] detailing the full recipe can be found on the bookshelves of the [[Exam Centre]]. To find the components and mix them into the required explosive, follow the steps below.\n\n*Go open the chest near the panning site to get [[chemical powder]].\n*Use your [[trowel]] on the [[barrel (Digsite)|barrel]] (marked with a skull and bones if you rotate the camera around) west of the tent with the chest to open it. Use your [[vial]] on the barrel to get an [[unidentified liquid]]. '''Do not drop the vial after filling it, or you will receive 25 damage and the vial will be destroyed.'''\n*Search the specimen tray north of the tent with a [[specimen jar]] in your inventory till you find [[charcoal]]. Grind it with a [[pestle and mortar]] to get ground charcoal.\n*:'''Note: If planning to do [[Desert Treasure I]], get a second charcoal to save time, but <u>drop</u> it while you grind the other, or else they will both be ground.'''\n*Show the chemical powder to Terry Balando in the [[Exam Centre]] to learn that it's ammonium nitrate, and then show '''<u>(be careful not to left click on the empty option)</u>''' the unidentified liquid to him to learn that it's nitroglycerin.\n*:'''Note: if he won't identify the liquid, find and read the [[Book on chemicals]] on a nearby bookshelf, then try again.'''\n*Mix the nitroglycerin and the ammonium nitrate. Then, add [[ground charcoal]], and then add the arcenia root. (10 [[Herblore]] required) Then, you get a chemical compound. '''If you drop the vial now, you will receive enough damage to drop you to 1 hitpoint.'''\n*:'''Note: ''' Once you have made the compound, you cannot make another one without dropping it and taking damage. In addition, you cannot empty or drop extra vials without receiving 25 damage.\n\n===The Temple of the Empty Lord===\n{{Needed|[[Chemical compound]], and a [[tinderbox]].}}\n[[File:The Dig Site - Senntisten.png|thumb|220px|left|The Zarosian altar found after blowing up the rocks.]]\nGo down the west winch, and use the [[chemical compound]] on the bricks (not the rocks), and then use a [[tinderbox]] (You can farm a goblin near the west fence, but not recommended) on the bricks to blow it up. Go into the room with [[Skeleton]]s (level 22, aggressive to players of level 44 and below), and pick up the [[Stone tablet (The Dig Site)|stone tablet]].

Doric will tell you he needs some materials in order to manufacture some [[pickaxe]]s. He will hand you a [[bronze pickaxe]].

To get there, go east from Doric's house and then north to find a path onto [[Ice Mountain]]. On the mountain, walk south and look for a ladder surrounded by buildings and [[Dwarf|dwarves]]. Climb down the ladder to enter the Dwarven Mine. The [[Iron rocks|iron]], [[Copper rocks|copper]], and [[tin rocks]] are located due south of the entrance. [[Clay rocks]] are located a little further south.\n\n[[Dwarf|Dwarves]] located outside the [[Dwarven Mine]], east of Doric's house, sometimes drop [[iron ore]]. This may help [[Ironmen]] trying to complete this quest before level 15 [[Mining]]. [[Members]] can buy the copper ores and iron ores at [[Ore Seller|the store]] in [[Blast Furnace]].

Alternatively, non-[[Ironman Mode|ironmen]] may purchase a shield from the [[Grand Exchange]].\n\n===Three pieces make a whole ===\nThe three map pieces may be collected in any order. After collecting all three, use any piece on another, and all three pieces will combine to form [[Crandor map]].\n\n====Melzar====\n{{Main|Melzar's Maze}}'''''Items required:''' The [[Maze key]], [[food]], and [[combat]] [[equipment]]. (The most difficult enemy is the [[Lesser demon (Melzar's Maze)|lesser demon]]; you can [[safespot]] it with [[Magic]]/[[Ranged]] and with [[melee]] as well.)''\n\n[[File:Melzar's Maze map.png|left|thumb|200px|[[Melzar's Maze]]]]\n[[File:Lesser demon (Melzar's Maze) safespot.png|thumb|220px|The [[lesser demon]] in [[Melzar's Maze]] can be safespotted using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]].]]\n[[File:Lesser demon (Melzar's Maze) safespot.gif|thumb|220px]]\n\nThe first piece is found in [[Melzar's Maze]]. You will need food if you have a low [[combat level]]. Melzar's Maze can be found north-west of [[Rimmington]], south of the [[Crafting Guild]], and west of [[Port Sarim]]. (If your [[house portal]] is located here, you may wish to teleport to house and exit portal.) To get inside of Melzar's Maze, you must use the [[Maze key]] you get from the [[Guildmaster]] in the [[Champions' Guild]] when you've started the quest. Once inside Melzar's Maze, do the following:\n\n#Kill the one long-tailed small [[zombie rat]] to get a [[Key (Melzar's Maze)#Red|red key]]. Once you have the red key, use it on the north-western red door (the room has a bookshelf, poster, table and chairs in it), and go up the ladder.\n#You will find yourself in a room full of [[Ghost (Melzar's Maze)|ghosts]]; kill the capeless, hooded ghost wearing a tube top to receive an [[Key (Melzar's Maze)#Orange|orange key]]. Go through the second door from the north, and climb up the ladder.\n#You will find yourself in a room full of [[Skeleton (Melzar's Maze)|skeletons]]. Kill the skeleton with a small, round shield to get a [[Key (Melzar's Maze)#Yellow|yellow key]]. Open the south-western door (make sure your map is oriented correctly) and go down the ladder at the end of the room.\n#Go down the ladder again, and again, until you find yourself in a room in the basement with two [[Zombie (Melzar's Maze)|zombies]] and a blue door. Kill the zombies until you get a [[Key (Melzar's Maze)#Blue|blue key]]. Use the key on the blue door to get to the next room. '''If by chance you exit through the normal door, you will have to start the maze over again'''. \n#In this room, you will need to kill [[Melzar the Mad]] (level 43). For lower level [[mage]]s or [[ranged|rangers]], it might be possible to trap a [[spider]] between you and [[Melzar]], preventing him from using his [[Melee]] attack, which causes him to do nothing for long periods of time during the fight. It is also possible to use the northernmost crate to safespot him completely. After you have killed him, pick up his [[Key (Melzar's Maze)#Magenta|magenta key]], and use it to open the magenta door.\n#In this room, there is a [[Lesser demon (Melzar's Maze)|lesser demon]] (level 82). There is a [[safespot]] that can be used with Ranged, Magic, or a halberd. Stand one square to the right of the magenta door when looking north. For non-halberd melee, lure the demon to the western part of the room, and attack it at his maximum attack range then walk one square west to make it lose interest, repeating that strategy as many times as needed (see gif to the right). Kill it to get a [[Key (Melzar's Maze)#Green|green key]]; use this key on the green door then open and search the chest to get a map part.\n#'''''Do not forget to claim the map piece from the chest in the green-door room.'''''\n#Go up the ladder, and exit the maze.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n====Thalzar====\n'''''Items required:''' An [[unfired bowl]], a [[wizard's mind bomb]], a [[lobster pot]], and [[silk]].''\n[[File:Dwarven Mine map.png|left|200px|thumb|The [[Dwarven Mine]]. Thalzar's room is at the north-east corner.]]\n[[File:Dragon Slayer - Thalzar's magic room.png|thumb|Thalzar's magic room with [[Magic door (Thalzar's room)|Thalzar's magic door]] and Thalzar's magic chest.]]\nTo obtain this piece, you'll need an [[unfired bowl]], created in the [[Crafting]] skill, a [[Wizard's mind bomb]], which can be bought at the [[Rising Sun Inn]] in [[Falador]] for 3 coins, a [[lobster pot]], which can be bought in [[Port Sarim]] for 20 coins, and a piece of [[silk]], which can be bought from the [[silk trader]] in [[Al Kharid]] for 2 coins (if you reject the trader's initial offer of 3 coins) or stolen from a [[silk stall]] with level 20 [[Thieving]]. \n\nWhen you have all these items, talk to the [[Oracle]], located on top of the northern end of [[Ice Mountain]], south-west of the shabby tent. The mountain is directly west of the [[Edgeville Monastery]] entrance.\n\n''If you do not have the option to ask the Oracle about the map, then you need to go back to the Guildmaster and ask about Thalzar's map.''\n\nAfter the Oracle has given you its riddle, descend the mountain and head slightly south, to enter the [[Dwarven Mine]] (using the ladder, under the canopy where all the dwarves are standing).\nMake sure to bring your silk, wizard's mind bomb, unfired bowl and lobster pot. \n\nHead to the square room at the north-east corner and open the [[Magic door (Thalzar's room)|magic door]] (see the attached map.) Place your silk, wizard's mind bomb, unfired bowl and lobster pot on the door to open it.\n('''be careful not to drink your wizard's mind bomb)'''.\nOpen the chest and search for the second map piece.\n\n'''''Note:''' The door locking mechanism won't be reset if you place an incorrect item, or leave and return to the door partway through the process.''\n\n{{clear}}\n\n====Lozar====\n'''''Items required:''' 10,000 [[coins]] '''OR''' [[Ranged]]/[[Magic]] [[combat equipment]] and runes to cast [[telekinetic grab]] ([[air rune]] and [[law rune]]; 33+ [[Magic]] required).''\n{{Map|name=Dragon Slayer I|3015,3188|zoom=1|rectX=18|rectY=26|mtype=rectangle|align=right|height=200|width=200|caption=Port Sarim jail}}\nThe third and final piece can be obtained by talking to [[Wormbrain]].\n\nAlthough the Guildmaster points the player in the direction of the [[Goblin Village]], it is possible to skip talking to [[General Bentnoze]] and head directly to the jail in [[Port Sarim]] to find Wormbrain.\n\nIf you didn't ask the Guildmaster about Lozar's map piece, you will not be able to attack Wormbrain. He can be attacked and will drop his map piece even if the player did not speak to General Bentnoze. Use one of two different ways to get the map piece from Wormbrain, located in [[Port Sarim jail]]:\n\n*You can attack him using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. Once his health reaches zero (he has 5 [[Hitpoints]]), he will say {{Overhead|Ow!}} and drop the map part for you to [[telegrab]] (if you bought an extra [[Wizard's Mind Bomb]], you can drink it to boost your Magic level +2).\n*Alternatively, you can pay him 10,000 [[coins]] in exchange for it.\n\n===Lady Lumbridge===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[hammer]], 90 [[steel nails]], 3 [[plank]]s, and 2,000 [[coins]].''\n[[File:Dragon Slayer - Crandor map.png|thumb|left|Crandor Map with all 3 pieces combined.]]\nYou will need a hammer, 90 [[steel nails]] and 3 [[plank]]s. To obtain the steel nails, you can either [[Smithing|smith]] six [[steel bar]]s into nails (requires level 34 Smithing, which is boostable), from other players, or as a member you can buy them from the [[Sawmill operator]] north-east of [[Varrock]]. If you are a [[free-to-play]] [[ironman]], there are only two sources of planks; one is at the [[Graveyard of Shadows]] in level 19 Wilderness and the other (which is recommended for [[Hardcore Ironman]]) is in an [[Ornate lockbox]] which can be found within the [[Camdozaal Vault]] after finishing the quest [[Below Ice Mountain]]. Members can find 4 plank spawns located just north of the [[Barbarian Outpost Agility Course]].\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer - Repairing Lady Lumbridge.png|thumb|Repairing the hole in your slightly-used ship.]]\nTake your nails, planks, [[hammer]], and 2,000 [[coins]], and head to [[Port Sarim]]. Look for [[Klarense]], a sailor, who is located on the second-most southern dock. He will sell you his boat named [[Lady Lumbridge]] for 2,000 coins. Pay him and the boat is yours. Board the ship and climb down the ladder. Patch the hole in the ship's hull by clicking it three times, and the ship will be seaworthy again.\n\n'''''Note:''' If you forgot your hammer, you can kill goblins west of the Port until they drop a [[hammer]]. On a [[members]]' world, you can also buy one from a [[Trader Crewmember]] on the dock to the south, or travel to the [[Void Knights' Outpost]] and buy one from the general store.''\n\nAdd. Note: If you die or flee from Elvarg in the final battle, you will need to complete the repair of the ship again, if this seem's likely, it's recommended you collect additional planks and nails. Additionally, you can take the ship to Karamja and go through the wall within the Volcano.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Recruiting a captain===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Crandor map]]''\n\nAfter fully repairing the [[Lady Lumbridge]], you'll need to find a captain. Go to Draynor Village and locate [[Ned]]. He can be found in the house just north-east of the [[Wise Old Man]]'s home. Ask him to be the captain of your ship. He'll agree to sail you to Crandor '''if''' you have already repaired the ship and hand him the [[Crandor map]].\n\n===Preparing for the fight===\n'''''Items required:''' the [[anti-dragon shield]], [[combat equipment]] and [[food]].''<br/>\n'''''Items recommended:''' quick-escapes, like [[teleport]] [[runes]], [[teleport tablets]] or the [[ectophial]]. [[Antifire potion]]s, and [[Prayer potions]] or [[restore potions]].''\n\n====General preparations====\nPrior to the journey to Crandor, you will need to prepare yourself. An [[anti-dragon shield]] should be equipped. If a player chooses to battle without it, [[Elvarg]]'s [[dragonfire]] can deal up to '''70''' damage. Members can drink a dose of [[antifire potion]], which reduces the attack damage of her dragonbreath. If combined with an anti-dragon shield, her dragonfire damage is significantly mitigated. In that case, Elvarg can only hit a maximum of 7 (3 or 4 if combined with Protect from Magic) with her magical attack instead of 11, thus saving you a lot of food. Being struck by her dragonfire attack without either an anti-dragon shield or antifire potion can drastically reduce [[Combat]] and [[Prayer]] stats. Even with the shield and/or a potion, her fiery breath will drain your [[Prayer]], so you would do well to have [[prayer potions]] or [[restore potions]] on you.\n\nLower-levelled members and [[Ironman Mode|ironmen]] without antifire potions are advised to use a [[ring of recoil]], as Elvarg's fast hits make it particularly useful in dealing back damage.\n\nAlso, bring [[teleportation]] [[runes]] or another teleport method just in case you are about to die during the fight.\n\nThe rest of your inventory should be filled with food. [[Lobster]]s, [[swordfish]] or better are optimal for fighting her. Swordfish are preferable to lobsters since they heal more per use (14 vs 12), but with a [[combat level]] of around 40 and appropriate gear, you should be able to easily defeat Elvarg using lobsters. If your stats are lower, you can buy [[meat pizza]]s or [[anchovy pizza]]s (or, with level 45 [[Cooking]], you could cook them yourself), as they heal more [[hitpoints]] per inventory slot, but require multiple uses to fully consume. A meat pizza heals 8 HP per bite (16 total) while an anchovy pizza heals 9 per bite (18 total).\n\n==== Dragonfire ====\n{{:Dragonfire/Elvarg}}\n\n====Choosing a combat style====\nBefore fighting Elvarg, you'll need to choose a ''[[Combat triangle|combat style]]'': melee, ranged or magic.\n\n'''Melee'''\n\nThis is the preferred style, as Elvarg will not solely use her dragonfire attack but also melee attacks when standing next to her, and the latter are less powerful. Furthermore, melee allows the player to flinch her. See the section on tips and strategies further down.\n\nEquip good-quality armour; preferably [[adamant armour]] or better.\n\nLike all [[Dragon (race)|dragons]], Elvarg is weak to [[stab]] attacks; see the page about [[Attack types]]. As such, consider wielding a [[Stab weapons|stab weapon]]: a sword or dagger instead of a scimitar. Adamant or better is recommended. For [[free-to-play]] players, a [[rune sword]] is recommended as it possesses the highest stab bonus in F2P, with its aggressive style the optimum for most players. A  [[rune longsword]], [[rune scimitar]], [[rune battleaxe|battleaxe]] or [[rune mace|mace]] are less effective but may still do decent enough damage. \nElvarg is not immune to [[poison]], so adding [[weapon poison]] would turn the battle even more in your favour; thus a poisoned [[dagger]] would be effective.\n\n'''Ranged'''\n\nElvarg is also weak against [[Ranged|ranged attacks]]. For F2P players, using ranged may not be a viable option. With no access to [[antifire potion|antifire potions]], equipping an anti-dragon shield is a must. This limits the player to a [[crossbow (weapon)|crossbow]], but F2P players only have access to the weakest types and to [[bronze bolts]]. Members ''can'' effectively use ranged on the dragon. Optimally, rangers should still equip an anti-dragon shield, so they should use a one-handed weapon such as a [[crossbow (weapon)|crossbow]]. Use the best crossbow with the best [[bolts]] they can use (preferably poisoned, see under Choosing melee). Make sure you have [[Auto Retaliate]] on and select the [[Combat Options#Rapid|Rapid]] firing style.\n\n'''Magic'''\n\nUsing [[Magic]] is not optimal, as [[Attack types|dragons resist magic fairly easily]]. If you still choose to use magical attacks, make sure you are using tier-2 Magic (i.e. [[Bolt spells]] such as [[Wind Bolt]], [[Water Bolt]], etc.) or higher (and, obviously, the anti-dragon shield).\n\n===Travelling to Crandor & locating Elvarg===\n{{Map|2840,3268|align=left|width=220|height=360|zoom=2|caption=The surface of Crandor.}}\n[[File:Dragon Slayer - Cabin boy Jenkins fried.png|thumb|right|A reason why dragonfire protection is needed to face Elvarg.]]\n\nHead back to and board your ship to meet up with Ned and Cabin boy Jenkins. Speak with Ned to depart and a cutscene will begin...\n\nAfter crashing on the southern side of [[Crandor|the island]], make your way to the top of the volcano (the [[dungeon]] marker on your [[minimap]]), avoiding [[aggressive]] [[skeletons]], [[moss giants]], [[hobgoblins]], and [[lesser demons]]. Enter the hole and a short cutscene plays, followed by abruptly finding yourself surrounded by [[Skeleton#Level 25|skeletons (level 25)]]. Down the corridor you'll find large [[Skeleton#Level 45|skeletons (level 45)]], and you'll see Elvarg in the main chamber behind stalagmites and stalactites. (If you are a member, you can climb back up the rope to complete a medium task in the [[Karamja Diary]], then climb back down.)\n\n'''Note:''' If you walk south, past Elvarg's chamber and past the lesser demons, you'll find a wall. One piece of it has an 'Open' option. Unlocking this secret entrance or shortcut from Karamja to Crandor will allow you to more easily return to Elvarg in the event that you die or teleport away during battle. If you ''do'' open the shortcut, you will not be able to travel to Crandor again by boat. You must then use the entrance underneath [[Karamja Volcano]]. Members can use an [[amulet of glory]] to teleport to [[Musa Point]] and go down the volcano to return to Elvarg quickly. If you ''don't'' open the secret door before attempting the fight and you die or teleport away, you'll need to repair the ship again. (In that scenario, Ned in Draynor Village will answer the player's question how he got back from Crandor with ''\"I got towed back by a passing friendly whale.\"'' When talking to Klarense again, he'll exclaim: ''\"Wow! You sure are lucky! Seems the Lady Lumbridge just washed right up into the dock by herself!\"'' Miraculously, the ship is not nearly as damaged as after the crash. Only the initial hole in the hull needs fixing once again, requiring the same materials as before (i.e.,  3 planks, 90 steel nails, and a hammer). Ned is standing on the deck just like before, but Cabin boy Jenkins is nowhere to be seen (obviously, since he died during Elvarg's attack on the ship).\n\nNow, go back to the main chamber, climb over the low stalagmites, and fight Elvarg.\n\n===Tips for the fight & potential strategies===\n[[File:Dragon Slayer - Fighting Elvarg.png|thumb|left|300px|A player battles against Elvarg, the destroyer of Crandor. In the top-left, the remains of the original adventurer who woke the dragon can be seen.]]\n\n*Before you enter the chamber to commence the fight with [[Elvarg]], make sure that you have your anti-dragon shield equipped. If you have lost it — say by dying in a previous attempt — another can be obtained from Duke Horacio.\n\n*If you have at least level 37 Prayer, [[Protect from Magic]] can be used to further mitigate Elvarg's [[dragonfire]] attacks. Consider immediately activating it as you enter the arena, as Elvarg, unlike other [[Green dragon|green dragons]], can use dragonfire attacks at a distance.\n\n*It is advisable to stand under Elvarg while eating, as it takes her a moment to move and hit you again. Alternatively, utilise the safe spot used for flinching (see below) to eat, and then run back into the fight.\n\n*If you have a decent [[Defence]] level (35 or more), it is advisable to stand within Elvarg's melee range, rather than [[safespotting]] her from a distance, as her [[dragonfire]] attacks can easily outweigh her [[melee]] hits. Standing next to her could reduce the number of times she will use her dragonfire attack, as she may choose to attack with melee instead, which has a lower max hit.\n*Note that while a cannon can be set up in Elvarg's area, it will attack the rats in the room rather than Elvarg.\n\n[[File:Elvarg safespot.png|left|thumb|A player standing in a safespot to heal up, or to use the flinching method.]]\n\n*Elvarg can be [[Flinching|flinched]] using melee attacks. This is fairly easy for players who know and have practiced flinching before, and the successful flincher may successfully slay the dragon while using little to no food. For players who are less skilled at flinching (this is especially true for players new to the mechanic), it is still recommended to take food, as getting her in the right position is quite tricky. In order to flinch this boss, you'll need to stand in the south-eastern corner of her cave, in the [[game square]] directly next to the north-west corner of the little lava pool. You'll also need to get Elvarg to stand directly left of the skeleton on the ground to the north-west. (See the image for the place to stand.) If you pull this off, you will notice she does not use melee or magic attacks while you're standing on this particular square; it is a [[safespot]]. From there, begin to attack her, and immediately click on the north-west corner of the little lava pool to walk back to the safespot. There are often rats occupying this particular square, so be mindful to click the square and not the rat. Wait for Elvarg's health bar to disappear, and repeat the process. This can and will still go wrong every now and then, so it is still recommended to bring food and have a decent combat stat.\n\n*If you happen to teleport away during battle, she will not fully heal if you return quick enough. This may prove to be a major advantage to the player who needs to take their time.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Returning to Oziach===\n[[File:Dragon Slayer - Elvarg slain.png|thumb|250x250px|A player beheads Elvarg]]\nOnce [[Elvarg]] is defeated and you have triumphed, you will automatically collect [[Elvarg's head]] (make sure you have an empty inventory slot). Either teleport out, or go through the shortcut and past the [[Deadly red spider|deadly red spiders]], to the south-east of the dungeon where the skeletons are, and climb up the hanging rope to arrive on top of Karamja volcano.

A quick way there is using the [[Spirit tree]] to [[Feldip Hills]]. He will let you join the guild if you can discover an ancient secret, and tells you to meet up with [[Dallas Jones]] at [[Karamja Wines, Spirits, and Beers]] on [[Musa Point]]. The fastest way to get to him is use the Karamja teleport on an Amulet of Glory and walk south. Another quick way is to use the TzHaar Fight Pit minigame teleport. You can also use fairy ring {{fairycode|DKP}} then travel south, over the log then north, then use the shortcut ([[Mith grapple|mithril grapple]] required).\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - hidden laboratory.png|thumb|A hidden laboratory found near Elvarg's lair.]]\nSpeak to [[Dallas Jones]], who will realise you are the Hero of [[Crandor]] after learning that you slew [[Elvarg]]. He tells you to meet him in her old lair. You can get back to Crandor by travelling through the caves in the volcano on Karamja, the opposite direction as if you were going to [[Mor Ul Rek]]. Once inside, you will have to climb over the wall. Speak to Dallas Jones again, and then use a [[pickaxe]] on a covered up wall at the north-eastern corner (there is a rock with a [[bronze pickaxe]] embedded in it just outside of Elvarg's lair). When the wall crumbles, enter the tunnel to find an ancient laboratory.\n\nInspect the machinery to the east for some [[old notes (Dragon Slayer II)|old notes]], then attempt to inspect the [[ancient mural]]. A Level 100 [[Spawn (Dragon Slayer II)|spawn]] will burst out from the nearby [[strange egg]] and attack you; kill it. Once it is killed, inspect the mural again, which illustrates dragons and fungi with the word \"Lithkren\". Dallas recalls an [[House on the Hill|old settlement]] on [[Fossil Island]] with similar architecture as the laboratory, with one of the many books he found there mentioning a place called Lithkren. He will ask that you make your way to the [[House on the Hill]] to meet him there.\n\n'''Note:''' [[Goutweed]] is required later on, if you do not already have one it can be obtained by stealing it from the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]] kitchen which is cheap and faster, or it can be farmed in a [[herb patch]] using [[gout tuber]], requiring 29 [[Farming]] and takes 80 minutes, but is not recommended due to their extremely high market value.\n\n==The House on the Hill==\n{{Needed|None.|recommended=7+ free inventory spaces.<br>'''Optional:''' 24 free inventory spaces will minimise walking.}}\n\nThe quickest way to reach the [[House on the Hill]] is with an enchanted [[digsite pendant]]; this requires having travelled to the House at least once. If players have not done so, they must reach the House by climbing the hill to the south-west using the bridge.\n\nOnce inside, climb down the [[trapdoor (House on the Hill)|trapdoor]] and speak to [[Dallas]]. He will tell the player that he had read through the ancient books again, and determines that the grid on the floor is a map of the island. He will ask you to find 24 [[map piece]]s, which are found near or around the House; don't go past the bridges, as there's nothing there. As you find pieces, you can return them to Dallas to look after, so you don't need enough inventory space to hold them all at once.\n\n*There are five scraps in the open chest at the same floor as you.\n*There are three more scraps in the open chest at the top floor.\n*There are seven scraps in a [[hook briar]] south of the house.\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II puzzle solution.png|thumb|250px|right|The completed map of Fossil Island]]\n\n*There are five in a mushtree just east of the house, near the strange stone.\n*There are four in the fungi next to the west staircase, outside.\n\nOnce all map parts are given to Dallas, the map now must be completed. The map consists of 24 tiles, five of which will be stuck to the board, signifying that's their final position. The free pieces must be rotated and dragged around the interface in order to make progress. If the puzzle looks correct but does not automatically close, check the rotation of the pieces, specifically the top-left piece.\n\nOnce all the map tiles have been correctly positioned, the puzzle will automatically close and appear on the floor, with Dallas determining the north-westernmost island to be [[Lithkren]]. Dallas will then ask you to look for [[Jardric]] for a boat, since he does not wish to ask the Museum expedition for it, as it requires a lot of paperwork and time to do so. Jardric can be found by the [[Fossil Island General Store|General Store]] within the [[Museum Camp]].\n\n==To Lithkren!==\n{{Needed|A [[hammer]], [[saw]], 8 [[oak plank]]s, 10 [[swamp paste]], 12+ [[nails]] of any kind (bring more to be safe).|recommended=[[Digsite pendant]].}}\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - building rowboat.png|thumb|left|250px|Building the rowboat to Lithkren.]]\nSpeak to [[Jardric]]. You will ask on [[Dallas Jones]]'s behalf for a boat, but he tells you that all the boats around the island are owned by the [[Varrock Museum]], so he suggests that you build one instead. He will tell you that you will need eight [[oak plank]]s, 10 [[swamp paste]], 12 [[nails]] of any kind ('''note''': extra nails are recommended, in case some bend), a [[saw]], and a [[hammer]].\n\nOnce these materials have been obtained, players should make their way north-west to the coast just west of the task only [[Wyvern Cave]] entrance in the [[Mushroom Forest]] and build the [[Rowboat space|rowboat]]. It is suggested that players unlock the [[Magic Mushtree]] for quick-access to the boat for future use. This is located just north-east of the rowboat at the transportation icon [[File:Transportation icon.png]]. With the enchanted [[digsite pendant]], this is the fastest way to [[Lithkren]].\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Lithkren.png|thumb|250px|Lithkren, an ancient dragonkin fortress.]]\nAfter the rowboat has been built, players can freely travel to and from the island.\n\nTake the boat to Lithkren. Head north, then go up the stairs on the eastern side of the south-western building. Go down the [[trapdoor (Lithkren)|trapdoor]] to the south, down the stairs to the north, then follow the path. Meet [[Dallas]] at the bottom. He tells you that he found these [[ancient doors]] but can't open them.\n\nSearch the nearby burnt [[Skeleton (Dragon Slayer II)|skeleton]] along the east wall for [[Aivas' diary]]. Read it to discover that a battle took place on Lithkren, led by none other than [[Robert the Strong]], a hero who lived during the [[Fourth Age]], well known for defending humanity against the [[dragonkin]]. Speak to Dallas again, telling him that Robert the Strong was reincarnated into [[Bob (cat)|Bob]] the cat. While finding the notion absurd, he asks you to track down Bob while he processes this new information.\n\n==Bob the Cat==\n{{Needed|Catspeak amulet, [[Teleports]] or [[runes]]: [[Nardah teleport]], [[Desert amulet 2]], [[Seal of Passage]], [[Pollnivneach teleport]] and [[coins]] for the [[magic carpet]], [[enchanted lyre]], [[Fremennik sea boots]], or [[Rellekka teleport]].}}\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - gift of catspeak.gif|frame|The Sphinx grants the player the ability to speak to cats without the catspeak amulet.]]\n\nFind [[Bob (cat)|Bob]], who can be located in a large array of places. Using your [[catspeak amulet (e)]] from [[A Tail of Two Cats]] will prove very useful here (to operate the [[catspeak amulet(e)]] you must press the whiskers to rotate the dial and go in the general direction indicated by the eyes lighting up). Bob begins in Burthorpe when the servers reset and has the largest wander radius in the game, but a few common places he can be found are listed below:\n\n*[[Varrock]] west bank anvils\n*[[Wise Old Man]]'s House in Draynor\n*[[Spria]]'s House in Draynor\n*[[Burthorpe]] in front of the games room\n*[[Catherby]] docks or inside the Fletching shop\n*[[Falador]] east bank/Party room\n*South-western part of [[White Wolf Mountain]], directly north of the Catherby fishing shop\n*[[Draynor Manor]] graveyard\n*[[Mudskipper Point]] near [[Thurgo]]\n*[[Sarah's Farming Shop|Farming shop]] south of Falador near the herb patch\n*[[Seth Groats]]' chicken pen north of [[Lumbridge]]\n*[[Seers' Village]] anvil\n*Murder Mystery House's front garden\n\nThese are some locations, refer to the [[A Tail of Two Cats]] quest guide to find a full list of locations.\n\n''(Make sure you have your amulet of catspeak to understand him. A very quick way to find Bob is to go to [[Varrock west bank]] anvils and hop worlds until you find him.)''\n\nWith your amulet of catspeak equipped, speak to Bob. You tell Bob about you needing his memories as [[Robert the Strong]], which he can't remember. You suggest to talk to the [[Sphinx]] again, to which he agrees.\n\nTravel to [[Sophanem]], and speak to the [[Sphinx]]. Before asking for her help, the Sphinx will grant you the ability to speak with cats without the amulet of catspeak, as you've proven yourself to be a friend of the felines. Tell the Sphinx of your problems; unfortunately, she can't help you, as she can't enter Bob's mind and choose specific memories of his life. However, you then remember the [[Oneiromancer]], who may be more capable to help you and Bob. Head to [[Lunar Isle]], and make sure you bring your [[seal of passage]] if you haven't completed the [[Elite Fremennik Diary|Fremennik Elite Diaries]] yet! '''Note: You can still use the bank booth operated by 'Bird's-Eye' Jack even without a seal of passage.'''\n\n==Robert the Strong==\n{{Needed|[[Seal of passage]], [[tinderbox]], [[goutweed]], 1 [[astral rune]], [[hammer]], [[pestle and mortar]], fighting equipment (good ranged defensive [[armour]] and [[food]]) Note: Ranged attacks are ineffective. 100,000 coins and teleport to Lunar Isle per death (recommended for safety).}}\n{{Instance|irs=at the [[Item Chest]] near the brazier|cost=100000}}\nHead to the [[Oneiromancer]], who is near the Astral Altar, and ask her about unlocking Bob's memories. She will tell you that you must make another [[dream potion]]. She will give you a [[dream vial]]. Fill it with water, and use your [[goutweed]] on it. Next, use a [[hammer]] on an [[astral rune]], and use the resulting [[astral rune shards]] on a [[pestle and mortar]], and use the [[ground astral rune]] on the dream vial to finish the [[dream potion]]. Once you make the potion, light the ceremonial brazier to the building at the far west and use the dream potion on it.\n[[File:Fighting Robert the Strong.png|thumb|left|250px|A player faces Robert the Strong.]]\nEntering Bob's dream, [[Not Bob]] tells you that the guardian needs to be defeated to bring back Bob's memories. You must fight [[Robert the Strong]]. He is level 224 and uses [[Ranged]]. [[Prayer]] can be used during this fight; however, he is able to hit partially through Protection from Missiles prayer; it's highly recommended to bring food as he is quite accurate and his normal attacks can hit in the 20's. [[Crush]] attacks work the best, as his crush defence is the lowest. Make sure to maximise your [[Ranged Defence]] and crush attack. Using [[Verac the Defiled's equipment]] can be a great option due to its crush bonuses alongside having a 25% chance to ignore Robert's defences. For players with lower levels (less than 70 [[Defence]] and [[Attack]]), [[granite equipment]] with a [[leaf-bladed battleaxe]] or [[Sarachnis cudgel]] can be a good alternative. Alternatively, for those on a budget, the four specs of a [[dragon mace]] can also be a surprisingly powerful budget option with the potential to max 40-60s (depending on the player's stats and gear) with the spec and then finishing off the remaining hp with a few more hits.\n\nRobert's special attack occurs after he says {{overhead|Let's see if you can hide from this!}} and a lightning bolt strikes his bow, which occurs approximately every twenty-five seconds. He fires a purple arrow at the player, which will deal 50+ damage and deactivate any current prayer(s) if it hits. Hide behind any of the four pillars to dodge the attack. Make sure you are completely behind the pillar, and not standing on the sides, as it is possible to get hit by the arrow if not. While running to and hiding behind the pillar, it is recommended to heal and restore Prayer if necessary to save time spent during the fight. If you do not run back out to fight him, Robert will teleport you back to him, telling you to {{overhead|Face me you coward!}}, though it does not deal damage or have any other effect. Wait until he teleports you to attack, as clicking before will cause your character to path away from Robert before attacking. Repeat until he is defeated. If your Magic level is 94+ you can use  [[vengeance]] to inflict large amounts of damage back.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - confronting dragonkin.png|thumb|300px|[[Aivas]], [[Tristan]], [[Odysseus]], [[Robert the Strong]], and [[Camorra]] confronting a [[Dragonkin (Dragon Slayer II)|dragonkin]] on [[Lithkren]].]]\n[[Bob (cat)|Bob]] will then remember everything now that the guardian is killed. A cutscene ensues, with [[Aivas]], [[Tristan]], [[Odysseus]], [[Robert the Strong]], and [[Camorra]] confronting a [[Dragonkin (Dragon Slayer II)|dragonkin]] in the dungeon beneath [[Lithkren]].\n\nIf you and Robert kill each other at the same time, talking to Bob and saying \"I'm ready\" will take you to the cutscene where Bob remembers everything.\n\nIf you leave the dream you do '''NOT''' have to remake the dream potion. You can re-enter the dream by talking to Bob.\n\n==The Dragon key==\n[[Bob (cat)|Bob]] tells you that he hid several key pieces around the world after the incident.\n\n(Using [[fairy rings]] and teleport tablets will reduce some of the time of the trip. One example of quickly getting to the [[Kharazi Jungle]] is to use a [[Brimhaven teleport]] and taking the [[Shilo Village cart system|cart]] to Shilo Village)\n\n[[File:Ultimate ironman chat badge.png]] '''Note:''' For Ultimate Ironman, consider acquiring the Vorkath key piece first to save inventory space during the fight.\n\n===Karamja key piece===\n{{Needed|[[Axe]] and [[machete]] if below 79 [[Agility]]|recommended=[[Food]], [[energy]] restoration ([[stamina potion]]s and [[Saradomin brew]]s recommended), and [[prayer potion]]s}}\n\n'''Note:''' Players with 79 [[Agility]] can access a vine [[shortcut]] into the [[Kharazi Jungle]] without needing an axe or machete.\n{{Map|mtype=square|r=12|2946,2900|align=left|width=200|height=200|caption=Location of the maze entrance.|zoom=1}}\n\n[[Bob (cat)|Bob]] tells you that he hid the [[Karamja]] key on the south coast of Karamja; the [[Kharazi Jungle]]. Head towards the south-eastern area of the shore, where there is a large mossy staircase leading into a [[cave (Karamjan Temple)|cave]]. This takes you to the [[Karamjan Temple]], a maze with the key piece in the centre.\n\nYou have to navigate the maze, with traps consisting of spike and man traps. The spikes can be disabled through [[Thieving]], and many traps leapt over with [[Agility]]. Note that toggling [[running]] off while leaping over the traps seems to improve the chance of success. To make matters worse, there are also multiple level 124 [[stone guardian]]s wandering the area in a [[multi-combat]] environment. Each stone guardian only uses one combat style (indicated by the colour on them), so [[pray]] accordingly. It is recommended to disable auto-retaliate.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Karamjan Temple maze route.png|thumb|right|The route to reach the centre of the temple.]]\n*'''Red''': [[Melee]]\n*'''Green''': [[Ranged]]\n*'''Blue''': [[Magic]]\n\nFollow the route as indicated on the map to the right. The traps will do more damage than the guardians, so be on the lookout for wall traps. Additionally, players may take a detour to the blue route to search a [[skeleton (Karamjan Temple)|skeleton]] and obtain [[Malumac's journal]], which provides some insight into the history of the Temple.\n\nOnce you reach the centre, grab the [[dragon key piece]] from the [[Plinth (Karamjan Temple)|plinth]]. The plinth also activates a two-way transport between the entrance and centre.\n\n===Morytania key piece===\n{{Needed|[[Spade]], [[ghostspeak amulet]], [[glassblowing pipe]], [[Dragonstone|cut dragonstone]], 2 [[molten glass]]|recommended=[[Teleports]] to [[Varrock]], [[Port Phasmatys]], [[Draynor Manor]], and [[Mort Myre Swamp]], [[Dramen staff|Dramen]] or [[Lunar staff]], and food ([[Saradomin brew]]s or [[druid pouches]] recommended if the [[fire of dehumidification]] has not been built)}}\n[[File:Varrock census records location.png|right|thumb|Location of the [[Varrock census records|Census records]].]]\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Morytania key piece dig strategy.png|thumb|600px|A map of possible key piece locations, which splits Mort Myre Swamp into 6 sections, starting at the {{Fairycode|BKR}} fairy ring, then further subdivides sections past that.|alt=Canifis fairy ring is CKS (not CKR)]]\n'''Note:''' The effects of swamp decay and Ghasts are nullified with an active [[Fire of Dehumidification]] with 50 Construction and completion of the quest [[Making Friends with My Arm]]. You should still bring food because the device will damage you while searching for the key, and food is cheaper than brews.\n\n[[Bob (cat)|Bob]] tells you that [[Tristan]] held onto this [[dragon key piece]]. Go to the [[Varrock Palace Library]], and speak to [[Reldo]] regarding this. He'll tell you of a book containing census records, and that he doesn't remember where it was, but knows that it had a red cover. Look for the [[bookcase (Dragon Slayer II)|bookcase]] that has a red book on it and search it to find the [[Varrock census records]]. Bring it back to Reldo for further inquiry. According to the records, it appears Tristan's descendants may have settled in [[Port Phasmatys]], as that is where most [[Morytania]] migrants settle.\n\nMake your way to Port Phasmatys, and make sure you have your [[ghostspeak amulet]] equipped. Speak to the [[ghost villager]]s, and they'll lead you to [[Sarah (Port Phasmatys)|Sarah]] in the house with a range just west of the bank. Alternatively, you may go straight to Sarah as well. Speak to her about the key; she buried it in the swamp to prevent the [[vampyre]]s from obtaining it, and does not wish for it to be found, as she believes it is safer that way.\n\nYou'll remark about a device that may find it, so head to [[Draynor Manor]] and speak to [[Ava]]. She can make you the device if you make her a locator orb, from '''two''' pieces of [[molten glass]] and a cut [[dragonstone]] with a [[glassblowing pipe]]. Make an [[inert locator orb]], then give it to her. After some adjustments, she will give you a [[locator orb]]. \n\nThe orb acts much like similar items, damaging the player when used in return for telling you where it is. The key piece will be located in 1 of 24 locations within [[Mort Myre Swamp]]. Make sure you have some food, taking 12-20 lobsters to last the trip; be wary of [[ghast]]s as they may rot your food. While you can't die from the orb's damage directly, the ghasts in the Mort Myre Swamp can sometimes deal 1-3 hitpoints of damage if you have no food or druid pouches in your inventory.\n\nA quick way to find the key piece is to start at the fairy ring code {{Fairycode|BKR}} and feel the locator orb, then using the map to narrow down the possible locations:\n* For example, if you get north-east, it will always be the lone purple spot that you need to cross the bridge to get to.\n* If you get south-west, south, or south-east, go to the centre of the subdivided area and scan again. For example, if you got west, go to the centre of the blue subdivision and scan there again. If you get west again, you've narrowed it down to a single dig spot.\n* If you're unable to see the message provided by the orb, try changing your game chat filter from \"on\" to \"filtered\".\n\nOnce you find the exact location, use your [[spade]] to dig it up.\n\n===Ungael key piece===\n{{Needed|[[Melee]] or [[ranging]] equipment, two types of [[dragonfire]] protection, [[venom]] protection, [[food]], [[prayer potions]]|recommended=[[Salve amulet (ei)]], [[runes]] for [[Crumble Undead]], a [[divine super combat potion]] or [[divine bastion potion]], 100,000 coins and a [[teleport]] to [[Rellekka]] in the bank to reclaim items from [[Torfinn]] if you die}}\n{{Instance|irs=Torfinn|cost=100000}}\n'''Note: Vorkath is a boss with multiple mechanics and attack styles.

While doing the quest, prepare your equipment and drink your potions <u>before</u> entering.'''\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - fighting Vorkath.png|thumb|250x250px|A player faces Vorkath.]]\n[[Bob (cat)|Bob]] tells you that he hid another key in an [[Ungael|abandoned dragonkin fortress]] north-west of [[Rellekka]]. Talk to [[Brundt the Chieftain]] about this fortress, and he tells you that a deadly beast has slain many of his warriors who went there. He'll give you permission to fight the dragon, and that [[Torfinn]] will take you there. In order to pass through, you will have to slay [[Vorkath]], an [[undead]] [[blue dragon]]. You will want to bring [[venom]] immunity items, as both Vorkath and the [[Spider (Ungael)|spiders]] in the dragonkin laboratory are capable of envenoming the player.\n\n====Mechanics====\n[[File:Vorkath - deadly dragonfire.mp4|thumb|300px|Vorkath's deadly dragonfire attack directly striking a player.]]\n'''Vorkath's dragonfire attacks deal heavy damage without two layers of [[dragonfire]] protection.''' Certain combinations of protection are more effective than others. Specifically, the dragonfire's max hit is reduced to 20 if using a regular [[antifire potion]] (or its extended version) AND [[Protect from Magic]], it is reduced to 10 if using a regular antifire potion AND an [[anti-dragon shield]] (or better), it is also reduced to 10 if using a [[super antifire potion]] (or its extended version) AND Protect from Magic, and it is reduced to 0 if using a super antifire potion AND an anti-dragon shield. It is recommended to use the strongest antifire protection available.\n\nVorkath has numerous attacks, but uses a predictable attack pattern. He will use 6 standard attacks in a row (in a random order) followed by one of his two special attacks. He will then use 6 more standard attacks, then the other special attack, and repeat this pattern.\n\nHis standard attacks are:\n* A melee attack that hits up to 32.\n* A ranged attack which looks like a spiky ball, and hits up to 28.\n* A magic attack which looks like a blue projectile, and hits up to 30.\n* Orange dragonfire that deals damage (two layers of dragonfire protection are required).\n* Green dragonfire that can inflict [[venom]] if unprotected.\n* Pink dragonfire that deactivates prayers (they can be turned back on immediately using [[quick prayers]]).\n* An orange fireball fired onto the player's position that deals extreme damage. '''This absolutely must be avoided by moving two tiles away'''. '''Dragonfire protection has no effect'''. Always watch out for Vorkath spitting a fireball in an arc upwards into the air, and move immediately. Standing only one tile away when it hits will result in half damage, but this can still hit 60+.\n\nHis special attacks are:\n\n* Vorkath will spit acid everywhere,  which will fall on random tiles in the arena; do not stand on these tiles as they deal damage and heal Vorkath. Turning off [[run]] is strongly recommended to navigate the poison spots. After this attack, Vorkath will rapidly barrage the player with fire attacks. '''The player must then''' '''walk''' (not run) throughout the rest of the attack to avoid the fire barrage. Be careful to avoid the poison spread out by his earlier attack, and always keep moving during the dragonfire barrage, or you will incur heavy damage rapidly. One trick to avoid the fire barrage is to find a clear straight path avoiding the poison splashes, then continue walking back and forth in that path until the barrage ends. Players can use the time spent walking during this attack to heal and drink potions (and optionally turn off prayer to save points).\n* Vorkath will shoot a freezing projectile at the player, freezing them in place, and then shoot another projectile somewhere else in the arena, where a [[Zombified Spawn]] will appear. Quickly use [[Crumble Undead]] on the spawn to kill it or else it will explode near you and deal 30+ damage.\n\nLonger-lasting potions such as [[anti-venom+]] and [[extended super antifire]] will allow you to spend less time keeping up protection and more time focusing on the fight. They are well worth the cost, if possible.\n\n==== Order of importance ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Mechanic\n!Order of importance\n!Notes\n|-\n|Special attacks\n|Highest\n|See above\n|-\n|Orange fireball\n|Highest\n|As soon as you see him launch the aerial dragonfire attack, you MUST move out of the way, or face an extremely high chance of getting hit for your full hp. There will be several ticks after the attack that you can use to drink any potions needed or heal up.\n|-\n|Dragonfire\n|Very High\n|If using a two-handed weapon such as the [[toxic blowpipe]], it is '''imperative''' that magic is prayed against at all times. If not, ranged prayers may be used. Set quick-prayers to protect from magic, and keep an eye out for the purple dragonfire attack. As soon as you see it, be prepared to turn your prayers back on via the quick-prayer interface.\n|-\n|Hitpoints\n|High\n|Keep an eye on your hitpoints, and do not let them drop below 32 at any point in time. If walking during the poison attack section, it's possible to let them drop further, as the main objective is now to avoid the magic attacks by walking away. If several squares ahead are open, you can use the walking time before your next click to heal up then. You will not be attacked by any of his other attacks at this time.\n|-\n|Venom\n|Medium\n|Drink an anti-venom potion as needed.\n|-\n|Melee attacks\n|Lowest\n|Stand a tile or more away from Vorkath to avoid melee damage altogether.\n|-\n|Poison attack\n|Special\n|When the poison attack comes on, you will only be attacked by his rapid fire attacks, which can only be mitigated by walking. For this reason, it no longer becomes necessary to pray magic or have any other protection. If you can get the timing, this is a good time to re-pot and eat back to full hp.\n|-\n|Zombified Spawn\n|Special\n|When you see a white dragonfire attack, you will be frozen, and a Zombified Spawn will appear several tiles away. As soon as you see the fire attack, click on your spellbook, select Crumble Undead, and look to see where Vorkath shoots the Spawn (marked by a visible projectile). As soon as the Spawn appears, cast [[Crumble Undead]] on it. You will have a few ticks after this to eat, so use this time to drink potions or heal if necessary.\n|}\n\n====The fight====\n''See [[Vorkath/Strategies]].''\n\nVorkath has 460 hitpoints and is weak to [[Stab weapons|stab]] and [[Ranged weapons|ranged]]. [[Dragonbane weapons|Dragonbane]] weapons are ideal, but are expensive and Vorkath can be defeated without them. If using melee, an [[Abyssal dagger]] or better is recommended, along with using Protect from Magic.\n\nIf using ranged with a crossbow and anti-dragon shield or [[dragonfire ward]], [[Protect from Missiles]] can be used. Another method is to wear high damage output equipment ([[Toxic blowpipe]] with adamant or better [[dart]]s, [[Karil the Tainted's equipment]] or better), using [[Protect from Magic]] and [[Extended super antifire|Extended]] or [[Super antifire potion|normal Super Antifire potions]]. If the player has access to a [[Salve amulet(ei)]] then it should also be used for increased damage against the boss.\n\nDuring the fight, the highest priority is to watch out for and dodge the fireball attacks, and the two special attacks. Learning the attack patterns will help the player stay alive long enough to kill Vorkath.\n\n====After the fight====\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Ungael laboratory.png|thumb|250px|Inside the Ungael laboratory.]]\nOnce he is defeated, move past him to the north-west to find a [[Dragonkin]] laboratory. Small level 35 spiders are here that can inflict venom, so make sure to bring an anti-venom potion. Inside the laboratory, you can inspect various [[Ancient Machinery (old notes)|ancient machinery]], [[Ancient Equipment|equipment]], and [[Ancient Incubator|incubators]] scattered throughout the room to find [[old notes (Dragon Slayer II)|old notes]] which detail the progress of experiments done within the lab. A total of 6 exist. To progress, pull a [[lever (Ungael laboratory)|lever]] in the south-west with at least 15% run. Once that lever is pulled, a [[door (Ungael laboratory)|door]] will unlock and a timer will start. Run to the previously locked room in the east and search the [[stone chest (Ungael laboratory)|stone chest]] for a [[dragon key piece]] and an [[Ancient key (Dragon Slayer II)|ancient key]]. '''Make sure to grab both of these before leaving!''' If you forget one of these items, you will need to return; fortunately, you do not need to fight Vorkath again.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Kourend key piece===\n{{Needed|[[Magic]] and [[Ranged]] protective [[armour]], [[food]], [[prayer potion]]s, a [[light source]], and a [[tinderbox]].|recommended=[[Dramen staff]] and [[stamina potion]]s}}\n\nBob tells you that [[Camorra]] hid her [[dragon key piece]] in a land far west. '''Note''': Players can directly visit [[Amelia]] in her house south of the archery shop in [[Shayzien]]. The next two paragraphs are optional should the player wish to read additional dialogue.\n\nMake your way to [[Port Piscarilius]] and speak to [[Veos]] (or [[Cabin Boy Herbert]] if [[A Kingdom Divided]] has been started), asking him about Camorra. One fast way to reach him is to use [[Kharedst's memoirs]]/[[Book of the dead|Book of the Dead]] to teleport to Piscarilius and running south to the piers. He will recommend that you go to the [[Library Historical Archive]], where you may be likely to find your answer. You can also teleport a short run south-east from the Grand Library using the memoirs.\n\nHead to the [[Arceuus Library]] and have [[Archeio]] teleport you to the Library Historical Archive. There, speak to [[Imerominia]] about Camorra. As [[Shayzien]] and [[Hosidius]] were founded during the [[Dragonkin Conflicts]], she will direct you to two historians specialising in the history of those two cities: [[Amelia]] of Shayzien and [[Jonathan]] of Hosidius.\n\nThe correct historian to visit is Amelia, so make your way to her house south of the archery shop in [[Shayzien]]. Players can use the [[Xeric's Lookout]] teleport on [[Xeric's talisman]] for the quickest route, running a short distance north-west. Alternatively, [[Kharedst's memoirs]]/[[Book of the dead|Book of the Dead]] teleports the player a fair distance north-west of Amelia's house. If neither of these options are available, [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|DJR}} may be used with a long run south-east.\n\nWhile you are at it, grab a [[tinderbox]] and a [[light source]] from the bank if you haven't already. Speak to her, and she will tell you to go to the [[Shayzien Crypts]], whose [[Crypt Entrance|entrance]] is found in the south-western part of the [[Graveyard of Heroes]].\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II crypt map.png|right|thumb|Map of the crypt.]]\nThere are three levels in the crypt, and you will need to make your way to the bottom level. Activate [[Protect from Magic]], as there are multiple high-levelled [[Zombie (Shayzien Crypts)|zombies]] and [[Skeleton (Shayzien Crypts)|skeletons]] (level 132) in a [[multi-combat]] environment. The zombies and skeletons use [[Ranged]], [[Magic]] or [[Melee]], so run past them as fast as you can until you reach the crypt. From the upper level, take the ladder in the north-east corner down to the middle level. Then, make your way to the far east ladder to get to the bottom level. Once you reach the bottom level, head to the centre, and enter the southern doors.\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Camorra's tomb.png|thumb|250x250px|A player in Camorra's tomb in the Shayzien Crypts.]]\nInspect Camorra's [[Tomb (Dragon Slayer II)|tomb]] and solve a riddle.

You may optionally talk to [[Dallas]] and Bob on [[Lithkren]] for context first. It is essential that you have completed the first [[Firemaking]] part of the [[Barbarian Training]] [[miniquest]], and then obtained instruction from Otto on how to create Pyre ships to gain access to the Ancient Cavern, or you will end up failing to gain entry and will thus be washed up at the shore to the south.\n\n[[File:Dragon forge - DS2.png|thumb|Ancient dragon forge.]]\nOnce on the floor with the [[brutal green dragon]]s, follow the east wall until you reach stairs leading to the [[mithril dragon]]s. Once up the stairs, travel west to a [[mithril door|door]] on the northern wall (southern-facing) of the central rock formation and open the mithril door with the ancient key. Go inside. Use [[Fire Wave]] or [[Fire Surge]] on the three dragon head structures. Go back out and travel east and down the stairs. Run to the south-west corner where the [[barbarians]] are and go up the stairs. Continue to the end and forge the four pieces together by using one of the several anvils.\n\nOnce you have the [[Dragon Key]], go back to the dragon door, which is located on [[Lithkren]] using the boat on the west coast of [[Mushroom Forest]] on [[Fossil Island]], and place the key into it.\n\n==The Ultimate Weapon==\nEnter through the [[ancient doors]] and continue down the hallway. Talk to Dallas or Bob, a cutscene will then play. You, [[Bob (cat)|Bob]] and [[Dallas]] will find a live dragon, before a [[Dragonkin]] approaches. The Dragonkin, [[Zorgoth]], reveals its name as [[Galvek]], the Dragonkin word for \"Fate\". Zorgoth notices that [[Robert the Strong|Robert]] has changed forms, and reveals that the attempt on his life by Robert had failed. He somehow recognises the player, but not Dallas, who will then ask Zorgoth about Elvarg, and why she attacked Crandor.\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Zorgoth appears.png|left|thumb|260x260px|Zorgoth, a dragonkin, appears before you, Bob, and Dallas.]]\nZorgoth reveals that as their numbers were dwindling, the dragonkin required a new weapon to turn the tide against the humans. Elvarg was the first of these dragons intended to destroy humanity, but remarks that it was a failure, and continued experimenting on various other creatures in various laboratories, including the one on Lithkren, where they began working on the ultimate weapon: a dragon that can control the minds of other dragons. However, Robert had launched an assault on the island, forcing him to seal the laboratory, with himself in it, in hopes that his kind will reopen the ancient doors to resume their work. However, due to Robert's actions, this never happened.\n\nZorgoth will state that being sealed in here has given him hundreds of years to perfect his creation, the dragonkin's salvation. Dallas will interrupt, asking why he intends to annihilate humanity. Zorgoth answers by saying that they were defending themselves from the humans, while Robert argues that they were the ones being attacked. Zorgoth continues, saying that only a handful of dragonkin who gave in to the curse of the [[Stone of Jas|Stone]] attacked the humans, but they were not willing to distinguish the aggressive dragonkin from the peaceful ones, and neither will he, stating humanity is a disease. He calls Galvek out of the incubation chamber, and Galvek launches fireballs at the group, killing Dallas. You grab Bob and narrowly avoid them.\n\nOutside, [[Jardric]] will investigate and find Zorgoth and Galvek. He fires a shot at Galvek, before being knocked away by Zorgoth. Galvek smashes through the roof and flies off with Zorgoth, who is preparing to organise the dragons for the assault on humanity.\n\n==A World United==\n{{Needed||recommended=[[Ardougne teleport]], [[Varrock teleport]] x2, [[Falador teleport]], transportation to [[Rellekka]]}}\n\n[[Jardric]] and [[Bob (cat)|Bob]] suggest that you should get [[King Roald]]'s aid, so go to [[Varrock]] and tell him of the threat. [[Roald]] trusts your judgement, so he asks you to get the other kingdoms and nations to work together; [[King Lathas]] (or [[King Thoros]]), [[Sir Amik Varze]] and [[Brundt the Chieftain]], while his advisor [[Aeonisig Raispher]] attempts to reach out to other people, as they will need all the help they can get.\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - the kingdoms unite.png|thumb|300x300px|The kingdoms of Gielinor meet to discuss the dragonkin threat.]]\nOnce all three have made their way to Varrock, head back to the [[Varrock Palace|castle]] and speak to Roald, who has organised a meeting in the dining room, and have agreed to launch an assault on [[Ungael]], where the dragons are gathering. Regardless of what you say of the plan, Bob will ask to speak with you outside.\n\nBob will tell you that [[dragonkin]] are immune to most weapons, and that the assault will not cease until [[Zorgoth]] himself is dealt with. Since Zorgoth mentioned that [[Galvek]] has the ability to influence the minds of other dragons, Bob deduces that killing Galvek will cause Zorgoth's dragon army to dissolve, which would end the assault.\n\nAfter talking to Bob, head to [[Rellekka]].\n\n==The Assault==\n{{Needed|4 free inventory spaces, dragonfire protection, combat gear, plenty of food.|recommended=[[Antidote++]], ranged gear, [[toxic blowpipe]], 2 [[super antifire potion]], [[stamina potion]], [[insulated boots]], [[summer pie]] or [[agility potion]].}}\n\nThe combined fleet will make its way towards the Dragonkin Fortress on [[Ungael]] to stop [[Zorgoth]]. Zorgoth will send his own powerful dragon army to counter the advance. Checkpoints are listed as parts and phases.\n\n{{Instance|irs=Torfinn|cost=100000}}\nCompleting each part acts as a \"checkpoint\", so you are free to teleport out after completing a part if you are low on supplies and will not have to restart from the beginning.

You will be placed on [[Brundt the Chieftain|Brundt's]] ship, and will need to repel a dragon assault for four minutes. The dragons will launch [[dragonfire]] towards the ship, either causing leaks, damaging the masts, wounding the rowers, or causing fires. There are several crates containing items to repair the ship and maintaining its integrity. If the ship's integrity falls to 0%, you will need to start over.\n\n*{{plink|Revitalisation potion (Dragon Slayer II)|txt=Revitalisation potion}} - Used to heal Fremennik warriors\n*{{plink|Hammer}} - Used to repair damaged masts\n*{{plink|Water container}} - Used to douse fires\n*{{plink|Swamp paste}} - Used to fill leaks\n\nWhen you are nearing the end of the 4 minutes you will notice that the frequency of damage to the ship will increase significantly and it will be impossible to have the ship cleared of all damage. The best tactic here is to always repair damage / heal the warrior closest to you.\n\n===Part II===\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - crossing shipwrecks.png|thumb|220x220px|Crossing the shipwrecks.]]\nWhat remains of the army advances onward, while the rest take their time to catch up. Before navigating through the shipwrecks, make sure you have full [[dragonfire]] protection, as there are several dragons, which will launch [[dragonfire]] at you throughout the area. You will want to bring a lot of [[food]], as you can fail some of the obstacles and take damage. There are several fancier ships, which act as \"milestones\". Several of the leaders will be fighting a lone dragon; you will need to kill it to proceed. The first \"fancy\" ship has a [[red dragon]], the second has an [[iron dragon]], and the last has a [[brutal green dragon]].\n\n====The Dragons====\nThe following table will run down each dragon that you will face.

They can deal up to 115 damage on direct hit and 57 if the player is within one tile; dragonfire protection has no effect. Keep Galvek on the screen at all times to look out for the fire ball spitting animation, or listen for the sound cue (a long rumbling noise), as you '''must''' move two tiles away quickly to avoid instant death. Note that turning off music (in Options) and zooming out to maximum distance (using the mouse wheel) may help here.\n\nThere are two waves of dragons to deal with in this part, each containing three dragons fought one at a time. There is a checkpoint after the first and second wave, so if you teleport out or die in wave 2 you will not have to complete wave 1 again.\n\nAt the start of Wave 2, the player's allies will appear and assist you in battling the dragons, and will do a fair amount of damage. It may be helpful to leave to change gear and restock after wave 1. You should teleport out, because the debris you can use to escape has a confirmation that may be difficult to click on during combat.\n\n====The Dragons====\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - fighting rune dragon.png|thumb|280px|The heroes aid you in a fight against a [[rune dragon]].]]\nThe following table will run down each dragon that you will face, one by one.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Wave\n!Dragon\n!Level\n!Attack styles\n!Special attacks\n!Tricks\n!Weak to\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |One\n|[[Black dragon]]\n|227\n|Melee only\n|Dragonfire\n|Stay out of melee range\n|Stab, Ranged, Water Spells\n|-\n|[[Steel dragon]]\n|246\n|Melee only\n|Dragonfire\n|Stay out of melee range\n|Earth Spells\n|-\n|[[Brutal red dragon]]\n|289\n|Melee, Magic\n|Dragonfire\n|Stay out of melee range, Use [[Protect from Magic]]\n|Stab, Ranged, Water Spells\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Two\n|[[Mithril dragon]]\n|304\n|Melee, Magic, Ranged\n|Dragonfire\n|Stay out of melee range\n|Earth Spells\n|-\n|[[Adamant dragon]]\n|338\n|Melee, Magic, Ranged\n|Dragonfire, Poison bomb\n|Use an [[antidote++]], stay lower hp (40-50)\n|Earth Spells, Stab\n|-\n|[[Rune dragon]]\n|380\n|Melee, Magic, Ranged\n|Dragonfire, Electric strike\n|Switch to [[insulated boots]], stay high hp\n|Earth Spells, Stab{{Efn|Using Ranged with enchanted diamond bolts is a viable alternative if you only have access to low-level gear or spells.}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\nMagic is effective for both waves, especially wave 2. Remember to pay attention to Galvek at all times to avoid his insta-kill fireballs.\n\nDamage can be avoided entirely during wave 1 except for when fighting the [[black dragon]] by staying out of melee range for the [[brutal red dragon]] and [[steel dragon]] while using [[Protect from Magic]]. However, the [[black dragon]] can hit up to 21 using their Melee attacks so [[Protect from Melee]] is advised.\n\nIn wave 2, the [[adamant dragon]]'s poison attack and [[rune dragon]]'s electricity attack can both be avoided by moving out of the way; however, it may be hard to do this alongside dodging Galvek's fireballs (which should take priority). For this reason, using antipoison and insulated boots is recommended as a backup.\n\nOne strategy to make wave 2 much easier is to stand underneath the adamant and rune dragons, as they will back into a corner and be unable to move or attack the player, allowing the allies to deal most of the damage. When Galvek prepares a fireball, run out from under the dragon and activate prayer ([[Protect from Missiles]] is best if using magic gear), then return back under the dragon once the fireball has landed. There will then be time to eat and use potions. Alternatively, since the dragons are so large it is possible to avoid the fireball by moving two tiles while staying under the dragon, preventing all damage.\n\n===Part V===\n{{Needed|recommended=[[Ruby dragon bolts (e)]] or [[Ruby bolts (e)]], [[Diamond bolts (e)]], [[Stamina potion]], [[Extended antifire|Extended antifire potion]], [[Anti-dragon shield]] or better, an emergency teleport, [[Ranging potion]], the remaining slots should be filled with [[Super restore]]s (or Menaphite Remedy) and [[Saradomin brew]]s in 1:3 ratio. '''Note''': The effects of [[super antifire potion]] do not work against Galvek's special attacks. Galvek is also immune to Ring of recoil's effect.}}\n\n[[Galvek]] will finally confront you for a fight. The dragon has 1,200 [[Hitpoints]] and four phases. Two brutal black dragons will then drop down, but the leaders will hold them off for you so you can deal with Galvek.\n\n====Dragonfire====\nIn addition to using all three forms of [[combat]], Galvek uses high-damage [[dragonfire]], and purple dragonfire that deactivates prayer. The following table calculates how much protection is necessary for these two attacks.\n{{:Dragonfire/Galvek}}\n\n\n====Galvek additionally has the following mechanics.====\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Galvek's fire traps.png|thumb|200x200px|Galvek's fire traps during phase 1.]]\n\n*'''Phase 1 (1200-900 HP)''': Galvek can place fire traps in set positions, which if touched, will deal up to your max health in damage in a 3x3 area. They automatically explode after a set amount of time or if Galvek is forced into the next phase. Players should remain on a line running north-to-south in front of Galvek, between the east and west fire traps. '''Pray Magic''' during this phase.\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Galvek's hurricane.png|thumb|200x200px|Galvek's hurricane attack during phase 2.|left]]\n\n*'''Phase 2 (900-600 HP)''': Galvek will harness the power of air on the west side, and begins to use Ranged attacks. He can launch a hurricane that will drain stats, especially [[run energy]]. '''Pray Ranged''' from this phase on. Drinking a dose of [[stamina potion]] during or after this wave is recommended to restore run.\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Galvek's tsunami.png|thumb|200x200px|Galvek's tsunami attack during phase 3.]]\n\n*'''Phase 3 (600-300 HP)''': Galvek will harness the power of water on the east side. He can launch a [[tsunami]], which will sweep across the ship from north to south or south to north, and must be avoided by standing in the one-tile gap as the wave passes. The tsunami can deal up to 109+ damage if you are hit. After launching the tsunami, he will follow up with the launched fireball attack, which must be avoided alongside dodging the wave. '''{{Colour|Red|Warning}}:''' Turn [[Auto Retaliate]] off, otherwise there's a chance you'll walk into a tsunami when he attacks you.\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - entombed in rock.png|left|thumb|200x200px|Galvek's rock tomb attack during phase 4.]]\n\n*'''Phase 4 (300-0 HP)''': Galvek will harness the power of earth, landing on the middle of the ship. He will launch earth projectiles that look like slow-moving rock balls at the player which entomb the player in stone if they are hit. These must be avoided by moving one tile away, otherwise the player may be unable to dodge the next fireball. If you are hit, it is possible to survive if a fireball is not fired. However, if it is fired while you are stuck it is best to immediately teleport out.\n\nFor this fight, it's highly recommended to use [[Ranged]], as while he is weakest against [[stabbing]] attacks, he is just as weak against Ranged. His high health pool means that [[Ruby bolts (e)]] can deal up to 100 damage, which significantly speeds up the battle. Once he is below 150 health, players should switch to [[Diamond bolts (e)]].\n\nIf the player is having trouble with Ranged, it is possible to defeat Galvek entirely with Melee, provided the player has high melee stats (90+ in Attack, Strength, and Defence). Players with 90+ Attack and high Stab bonuses will consistently hit Galvek, reducing his health rather quickly, and at a much more consistent rate than utilising [[Ruby bolts (e)]]. Another advantage to a Melee attempt is that Galvek's own Melee attack is far less accurate than any of his other standard attacks, provided the player has a high Defence level. Players should equip a [[Zamorakian hasta]] and [[Dragonfire shield]] and have Protect From Magic and Piety active for the entirety of the fight, and should equip tank armour.\n\nThis fight can take multiple tries at a low level because of the randomness of the Ruby bolts (e) that do the majority of the damage. It's highly likely that in the player's first few tries, they may need to teleport out in the event of food shortage. Using [[Super restore]]s alongside [[Saradomin brew]]s in a 1:3 ratio will prolong the fight and give players a better chance of defeating him.\n\nIf both the player and Galvek die at the same time, he doesn't need to be fought again. When you go to the fleet, the cutscene of Galvek dying will play.\n\n==End of the Battle==\nOnce Galvek reaches zero health, he spirals out, falling to the ground. With his last, dying (dragon)breath, which shoots backwards, Zorgoth is completely incinerated. With Galvek slain and the Dragonkin menace defeated, the battle has been won.\n\nYou will be brought back to [[Burthorpe]], where you, [[Unferth]], and [[Neite]] will mourn [[Bob (cat)|Bob's]] death. Make your way back to [[Alec]] and inform him of your achievements; he will be impressed and initiate you as a member of the [[Myths' Guild]].\n\n===The story kin-tinues===\nIf you have completed [[While Guthix Sleeps]] before completing Dragon Slayer II, an extra cutscene will play before the quest is completed.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the [[Lithkren Vault]], three [[Dragonkin]] — [[Strisath]], [[Sithaph]], and [[Sakirth]] — will break free from their stasis chambers, noting that [[Zorgoth]] is dead and someone has used the Stone, and agree to bring terror to the mortals who wish to claim its power.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nDragon Slayer II - Zorgoth death.gif|thumb|Zorgoth incinerated by his own creation.\nDragon Slayer II - Ending.png|Being congratulated after defeating Galvek.\nDragon Slayer II - Bob's funeral.png|The player, Neite, and Unferth at Bob's grave.\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - Dragonkin appear.png|The dragonkin awaken in the Lithkren Vault.\n</gallery>\n\n'''Congratulations, Quest Complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Dragon Slayer II\n|image = [[File:Dragon Slayer II reward scroll.png|center]]\n|qp = 5\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Smithing|80,000|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Mining|60,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Agility|50,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Thieving|50,000|link=yes}} experience\n*Ability to speak to cats without the [[Catspeak amulet]]\n*Access to the [[Myths' Guild]]\n**Access to the pettable [[Dog (Myths' Guild)|dog]]\n**Ability to make [[super antifire potion]]s by speaking to [[Primula]]\n**4x 25,000 experience in [[Magic]], [[Ranged]], [[Strength]], [[Attack]], [[Defence]] or [[Hitpoints]] by speaking to [[Ellen]]\n**Access to [[Fountain of Uhld]] where dragonstone jewellery (excluding the [[ring of wealth]]) can be recharged\n**Access to the [[Pool of Dreams]] where players can choose to fight [[Galvek]] again or rewatch [[cutscene]]s from the quest\n**Access to the [[Wrath Altar]]\n**Access to the shop to buy the [[mythical cape]]\n*Access to [[adamant dragon|adamant]] and [[rune dragon]]s in the [[Lithkren Vault]]\n*Access to a stronger version of [[Vorkath]] on [[Ungael]]\n*Ability to reforge the [[dragon platebody]] and [[dragon kiteshield|kiteshield]]\n*Ability to have a [[Rune dragon (Construction)|rune dragon]] as a [[Treasure Room]] guardian (requiring 99 [[Construction]] and 25,000,000 [[coins]])\n*Ability to create an [[Ava's assembler]] by bringing [[Vorkath's head]], 75 [[Mithril arrow]]s, and 4,999 coins (or [[Ava's accumulator]]) to [[Ava]] in [[Draynor Manor]]\n*Ability to craft [[Ferocious gloves]] from [[Hydra leather]] in the [[Lithkren Vault]] (requires a hammer)\n*Ability to construct [[Mythical cape (mounted)]] in your POH\n*Ability to go back through the [[ancient doors]] on [[Lithkren]] and use your [[Digsite pendant]] on the Strange Machine north of the dragons.

The winner of the competition, ''Runezilla'', was awarded an \"exclusive Old School goodiebag!\".\n*The first player to complete the quest on the day of release was ''Rambo The 3'' in a time of 2 hours and 55 minutes.{{CiteTwitter|author=Old School RuneScape|url=https://twitter.com/OldSchoolRS/status/948913837377490944|date=4 January 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/r7Xze|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=Congratulations to 'Rambo The 3' on being the first ever player to complete Dragon Slayer II with a total time of 2 hrs 55 mins!}}\n* When the player first meets Zorgoth, he addresses the player as if they've already met before (\"''Ah, I see you [Robert] brought your friend with you. I'm surprised to see you here after all this time. Curious...''\") While initially believed to have implied that he was addressing the player as someone [[Robert the Strong]] knew in his past life, it was later confirmed by [[Mod Ed]], who wrote the quest, that Zorgoth was referring to the player themselves, not someone else.{{CiteNews|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/qa-summary-07042022?oldschool=1|title=Q&A Summary 07/04/2022|newsdate=12 April 2022|quote=Zorgoth was referring to the player. He did not make any mistakes there; he recognised the player. As for what that means, the answer's in a future quest. But not a quest that is planned for anytime soon.}}\n*When telling [[Juna]] a story about the quest, the player says \"''... so I slew the dragon which killed the dragonkin as well. Not everyone survived the fight though.''\" to which she responds \"''The dragonkin once brought this world to the brink of ruin. It is good you stopped them from doing so again.''\"\n*The dialogue in Bob's memory of Robert the Strong confronting the Dragonkin: \"''Now it begins''\" \"''No, now it ends''\" is a reference to the Tower of Joy battle scene in the television show ''{{WP|Game of Thrones}}''.\n*The spawn that appears in the Crandor laboratory, along with Vorkath's zombified spawn, are a reference to {{WP|Facehuggers}} from the movie ''{{WP|Alien (film)|Alien}}''.\n*When [[Amelia]] tells the player that the Shayzien Crypts are overrun by the undead, the player says \"''I ain't afraid of no ghosts''\". This is a reference to the film ''{{WP|Ghostbusters}}''.\n*If players use a spade on Bob's grave after completing the quest, a message will appear in the chatbox stating \"''You would desecrate Bob's grave? You monster!''\"\n*While speaking to King Roald for help to defeat the dragonkin, if players have completed the quest [[Darkness of Hallowvale]], Aeonisig tries to recommend against military action. King Roald will interrupt him, stating that the situation is completely different from Morytania's and needs to be acted upon. Immediately afterwards, the player also objects to [[King Lathas]]' assistance referencing the events of [[Regicide]].\n*If the player has completed the [[Battle of Ardougne]] as part of the quest [[Song of the Elves]], King Roald will instead ask the player to visit [[King Thoros]] for assistance.\n*When telling Dallas Jones Robert the Strong was reincarnated to Bob, Dallas responds \"Just think once before you speak please!\" This could be in reference to a popular ''RuneScape'' meme.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Dragon Slayer II}}"

Changing [[spellbook]]s to the [[Lunar spells|lunar set]] may help, as will carrying [[runes]] to teleport back to the bank.\n\n*Travel north-east from the bank and go down the [[Lunar Isle mine|mine]]—then, crawl through the passageway to reach the [[Cyrisus|fallen man]] (located just south-east of where you entered the cave. The cave entrance will appear as a red line in the wall on your [[minimap]]). You can talk to him and inspect him. The inspect option opens a status screen. \n*:'''Note:''' If you didn't bring enough food, you have to run back to the bank; to make it faster and safer, you should use level 69 Lunar Spell, [[Moonclan Teleport]].\n\n[[File:Dream mentor cyrus stats.png|thumb|220px|Cyrisus isn't well.]] \n\n*He will need you to increase three stat bars, in this order: health, spirit, and armament.\n*To feed him, you should take three kinds of food—it doesn't matter what food; [[shark]]s aren't better than [[tomatoes]]. Take seven pieces of two kinds and six of the third. Cyrisus will reject any type food that he has eaten recently - either the last piece of food, or the one before that. Use the one piece of the two foods that you have seven of on Cyrisus to feed him, followed by the one that you have six of. Continue feeding him in this order until the chat box says he doesn't need any more food. If he refuses the food, you already fed it to him recently, so just give him a different kind of food. You will have to feed him four separate times, with dialogue in between.\n*:'''Note:''' You can use one type of food by logging out. Using sacks or baskets of [[Allotment|farm produce]] is a good idea.\n*:'''Note:''' Make sure to take the food out of the sack before using it on him, using an entire sack only counts as one item.\n*: '''Note:''' He won't accept beverages other than [[wine]] and Guthix Rest.\n*Increasing his spirit is done by talking to him, but just try to choose the most positive things. This part is long, but no dire consequences if you get it wrong. Make sure he's standing up and both his health and spirit are at least at 70 and 72% respectively before you leave the cave.\n\n[[File:dream mentor bank.png|thumb|220px|Cyrisus' bank.]]\n\n*For armour, go to the [[bank]] on [[Lunar Isle]] and talk to the most right banker [['Birds-Eye' Jack]]. Tell him you want to access Cyrisus' bank account—from there, select a helmet, top, legs, boots, and weapon. It is guess and check whether or not you got it right. The easiest way to check is using the level 67 Lunar spell, [[NPC Contact]], to ask Cyrisus whether you chose right. It may take several tries, but eventually, he will tell you your choice is just right—take that set to him in the cave.\n*: '''Note:''' The most common set (for players with combat level determined by [[melee]] skills) is a [[dragon med helm]], [[Ahrim's robetop]] and [[Ahrim's robe skirt|robe skirt]], [[ranger boots]] and an [[abyssal whip]]. Cyrisus ends up dressed like a melee fighter.\n*: For archers (players with [[ranged]] being the dominant combat skill), the combination is a [[splitbark helm]], [[Karil's leathertop]], [[Torag's platelegs]], [[adamant boots]] and a [[magic shortbow]]. Cyrisus will look like an archer.\n*:For mages (players with [[magic]] being the dominant combat skill), the combination is a [[robin hood hat]], [[dragon chainbody]], [[black d'hide chaps]], [[infinity boots]] and an [[ancient staff]]. Cyrisus will look like a mage.\n\nNow, you have to reach 100% in all of his remaining stats. Once Cyrisus has reached 100% in all stats, he'll tell you that he's afraid of [[Combat]]. Afterwards, you'll agree to accompany him to the [[Oneiromancer]]—exit the mine, and go southward.\n\n===Making the potion===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Goutweed]], a [[hammer]], a [[pestle and mortar]] and an [[astral rune]].''\n\n*Head south to the [[Oneiromancer]] on the south-east part of the island near the [[Astral Altar]]. Talk to her, and [[Cyrisus]] will appear. The Oneiromancer will suggest going into [[Dreamland]] together to solve Cyrisus' fear of combat.\n*'''Note: If you're using Magic for the upcoming fight and were on the Lunar Spellbook, don't forget to switch back to Standard Spellbook/Ancient Spellbook''' (your choice; Standard Spellbook is closer, done by praying to the [[Astral Altar]]).\n*The Oneiromancer will give you a [[dream vial]]. Fill this with water. The nearest water source is the house west of the bank.\n*You need to obtain some [[goutweed]], either by growing a [[gout tuber]], or by stealing it from the troll kitchens from [[Eadgar's Ruse]] quest. (If you go back to the troll kitchen, it is recommended to grab two goutweed in total if you plan on doing [[Dragon Slayer II]].)\n*Use the goutweed with the vial.\n*Use a [[hammer]] with an [[astral rune]], and then, use a [[pestle and mortar]] on the result—add this to the potion to get a [[dream potion]].\n\n===The battles===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Dream potion]], a [[tinderbox]], [[armour]], a [[weapon]], and good [[food]], [[seal of passage]].''\n{{Instance}}\n\nUsing [[Our lives|the lectern]] at the north of the arena is the '''only''' way to leave the following fight.

If you die you will always lose your [[seal of passage]] and will have to speak with Brundt to get a replacement.\n\nIn the upcoming fight, four bosses must be defeated in a row, '''without the use of prayers'''.\n\n'''It is highly recommended to use magic for the fight.''' All four bosses have very low magic defence, and magic will hit consistently even if you wear melee gear to reduce incoming damage. An excellent strategy is to use a [[trident of the seas]], but [[Iban Blast]], [[Warped sceptre]] or [[Blood Rush]] are also very good options. Strong melee armour, a shield with high ranged defence, and plenty of high-healing food are recommended. A [[halberd]] can also be brought to safespot the second and third bosses if desired. Lower-levelled players may want to drink a dose of [[divine battlemage potion]] prior to entering.\n\n'''Note:''' Remember to bring the [[seal of passage]].\n\nGo to the Dream Hall, the large building on the west side of Lunar Isle, where Cyrisus will be waiting for you. Light the brazier with a [[tinderbox]], and talk to Cyrisus to enter the dream world. During the fight, a bar showing Cyrisus's Courage will be shown, and he will occasionally attack or use [[Vengeance Other]] on you.\n\nYou will then have to fight, in order, four monsters representing Cyrisus's fear:\n\n*[[The Inadequacy]] ''(level 343).'' This is by far the hardest part of the fight, so don't worry if you use most of your food on it. The Inadequacy will use powerful and accurate melee and ranged attacks, but will only use ranged if the player is outside of melee range. It will also summon [[A Doubt|Doubts]], which should be ignored in favour of defeating the boss as quickly as possible. Magic will hit dependably even with a negative magic attack bonus. Use available special attacks, like from a [[dragon dagger]] to deal damage quickly. Make sure to keep your health above 30 and the boss will eventually go down.\n*[[The Everlasting]] ''(level 223).'' Hits high, but can be easily [[Safespot|safespotted]] by '''standing directly next to the lectern on the north side of the arena'''. Note that due to its size the player cannot walk through the Everlasting, so be careful not to get trapped between it and the side of the arena. After it is killed, the next boss may spawn in a position that allows it to attack a player in the safespot. To avoid this, run out during the Everlasting's death animation so the next boss spawns further away, or lure it away before killing it and return to the safespot on the other side of lectern. Finally, this boss can be kited (especially with a stamina potion).\n*[[The Untouchable]] ''(level 274)''. Similar to the Everlasting but with much lower health, and can also be safespotted with Magic or a halberd. This boss can also be kited.\n*[[The Illusive]] ''(level 108)''. Not much of a threat, though it will regularly burrow into the ground and reappear somewhere else, forcing the player to chase it around.\nAfter defeating the Illusive, Cyrisus will finally conquer his fear and stomp it to death.<gallery>\nFighting the Inadequacy.png\nFighting the Everlasting.png\nFighting the Untouchable.png\nFighting the Illusive.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Finishing up===\n'''Note:''' Do not bank your [[seal of passage]] after the fight. You will need it to finish up the quest.[[File:Cyrisus transfers knowledge.gif|thumb|220px|Cyrisus transfers some knowledge to the player.]]\nTravel back and talk to the [[Oneiromancer]] on the south-east of [[Lunar Isle]]. Cyrisus will thank you for helping him, and in gratitude uses Lunar Magic to grant you some of his knowledge.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Dream Mentor\n|image = [[File:Dream Mentor reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Hitpoints|15,000}} [[Hitpoints]] experience\n*{{SCP|Magic|10,000}} [[Magic]] experience\n*7 new spells added to your [[Lunar spells]] book ([[Monster Examine]], [[Humidify]], [[Hunter Kit (spell)|Hunter Kit]], [[Stat Spy]], [[Dream]], [[Plank Make]], [[Spellbook Swap]])\n*A [[dreamy lamp]], which awards 15,000 [[experience]] in a combat skill of a player's choosing, apart from [[Attack]] and [[Prayer]].\n*[['Birds-Eye' Jack]] will now allow you to use the bank without a [[seal of passage]] equipped or in your inventory.\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[The Untouchable]], [[The Everlasting]], [[The Inadequacy]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Dream Mentor is required for the following:\n*[[Dragon Slayer II]]\n*[[While Guthix Sleeps]]\n*[[Hard Desert Diary]]\n*[[Hard Kourend & Kebos Diary]]\n*[[Elite Varrock Diary]]\n\n== Trivia==\n*On the day of release, if you clicked to see the rewards of the quest, it said \"Spoilers? On the day of release? Tell him he's dreaming!\", an allusion to the Australian movie 'The Castle', instead of the usual message.\n*Cyrisus explains that he can make [[Rune platebody|rune platebodies]], grow [[spirit tree]]s, and make [[summer pie]]s — a reference to a high level player in ''RuneScape''. This also confirms that he has at least one mastered skill, as making rune platebodies requires 99 [[Smithing]].\n*Dream Mentor is the first quest with a combat level requirement. Earlier quests only have single skill level requirements.\n* Cyrisus' bank has an approximate value of {{NoCoins|{{GEP|Logs}}+{{GEP|Dragon chainbody}}+{{GEP|Ahrim's robetop}}+{{GEP|Karil's leathertop}}+{{GEP|Vial of water}}+{{GEP|Chisel}}+{{GEP|Antipoison(1)}}+{{GEP|Lobster}}+{{GEP|Hammer}}+{{GEP|Knife}}+{{GEP|Magic logs|1464}}+{{GEP|Empty plant pot}}+{{GEP|Strength potion(2)}}+{{GEP|Dragon med helm}}+{{GEP|Splitbark helm}}+{{GEP|Robin hood hat}}+230000+{{GEP|Abyssal whip}}+{{GEP|Ancient staff}}+{{GEP|Magic shortbow}}+{{GEP|Ranarr weed|594}}+{{GEP|Shark}}+{{GEP|Bucket}}+{{GEP|Rope}}+{{GEP|Torag's platelegs}}+{{GEP|Ahrim's robeskirt}}+{{GEP|Black d'hide chaps}}+{{GEP|Infinity boots}}+{{GEP|Ranger boots}}+{{GEP|Adamant boots}}+{{GEP|Air rune|52584}}+{{GEP|Blood rune|3524}}+{{GEP|Cosmic rune|9864}}|c}}.\n* After the quest, you can contact Cyrisus via the [[NPC Contact]] lunar spell. He cycles between four tasks:\n**Killing [[TzTok-Jad]].\n**Killing the [[Kalphite Queen]], joined by some of the [[Slayer Master]]s.\n** A top secret meeting between the rulers of Gielinor (a possible reference to [[Recipe for Disaster]]).\n**[[Player killing]] in the [[Wilderness]].\n*Both of the Lunar quests have had their official difficulty level increased shortly after release. [[Lunar Diplomacy]] was released as an intermediate quest, and was changed to an experienced quest. Dream Mentor was released as an experienced quest, and was changed to a master quest.\n*Attempting to feed purple sweets to the Fallen Man is not possible, yielding a message saying: {{mes|Sweets? You do know they rot your teeth?}}\n*Player chat dialogue was changed from \"What on Runescape is that?\" to \"What on Gielinor is that?\"\n\n{{Dream Mentor}}"

Continue south towards Lumbridge and kill a [[chicken]], then a [[cow]] in the [[Lumbridge pasture|pasture]].

If you do not have the 20 [[Agility]] required to cross the log, you will need to enter the fenced area from the south via the gate. He will explain his dilemma of the goblin forces approaching from the south. He will allow you to join the [[Dwarven Black Guard|Black Guard]], the elite of the dwarven military. After you accept he will give you 6 [[railing]]s and a [[hammer]] (if you do not already have one in your inventory) so that you can help with fixing the railings.\n\nThe damaged railings around the complex are clearly bent (if you zoom in and look at the fence directly from the back or front), repair these by \"inspecting\" the appropriate sections of railing. If you fail to repair a rail, you may take 1 or 2 damage or your [[Strength]] or [[Crafting]] will be temporarily reduced. This damage may kill you if your hitpoints are 2 or below. It may take several attempts at each damaged section, if it doesn't say you repaired it, and straighten the fence you must do it again.\n\nAfter repairing all 6 rails, talk to Captain Lawgof again and he will explain that communication has stopped with the watchtower. '''(important that you finish the conversation)'''\n\nGo outside the gate and a little to the south you will find the watchtower (indicated on the map by a ladder)\n\nClimb the ladder to the top floor and retrieve the dwarf remains and take them back to Captain Lawgof.\n\nDevastated, Captain Lawgof will tell you that the dwarf who had been killed when the watchtower was overrun was [[Gilob]] who had a son named [[Lollk]] that is still missing.\n\n===The missing son===\n{{Needed|recommended=[[Food]] (lower levels) and a [[skills necklace]].}}\n[[File:Dwarf Cannon - Lollk.png|thumb|right|Location of the [[Lollk|dwarf child]] in the [[Goblin Cave]].]]\nHead south-east to the [[Fishing Guild]] and enter the cave just east to the [[Fishing Guild]]'s entrance.\n\nThe cave forks into three passages. Take the centre passage and head north-west to find the goblin outpost. Go further north-west to a room filled with crates inside. Search the northern most [[Crate (Dwarf Cannon)|crate]] on the east wall (as seen in the picture) and Lollk will jump out.

You need to match up the three tools with the three parts on the screen that shows up in this order:\n\n#Use the pliers on the safety switch at the bottom. (2nd tool)\n#Use the hooked tool on the spring. (3rd tool)\n#Use the toothed tool on the gear located at the bottom of the hammer, on the gear. (1st tool)\n\nTalk to Captain Lawgof again, and he will tell you that he doesn't know how to get ammo for the cannon. He will tell you to go to the dwarf base south of [[Ice Mountain]] above the entrance to the [[Dwarven Mine]] to find out about the ammo.\n\n{{Map|name=Nulodion|x=3012|y=3452|r=4|mtype=square|align=right|caption=[[Nulodion]]'s location.}}\n[[File:Nulodion chathead.png|left]]\nThe fastest way to arrive there is using a [[combat bracelet]] to teleport to the monastery.

He will ask you to find out the secret of the herb [[goutweed]], in order to perform the next part of the purifying ritual on the [[Druid's circle]]. Only the [[troll]]s in the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]] know about goutweed, so Sanfew will suggest you speak to his friend, [[Eadgar]], who lives near there at the top of [[Trollheim]].\n\nIt is safe practice to check the quest journal after each step to ensure you have completed each task.

Go south at the fork in the path to [[Tenzing]]'s house. If you don't already have [[climbing boots]], buy some here from Tenzing for 12 [[coins]]. Wear the climbing boots, and climb over the stile in his back yard, following the path north. At the next junction, climb over the rocks, follow the path, and go west at the next fork climbing over rocks as required. Head north to the Secret Entrance that will place you on the lower level of the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]].\n\n====Rellekka route====\n''If using a [[Slayer ring]] or a [[Dramen staff]], you must have [[climbing boots]] already as you won't be able to reach [[Tenzing]] from this path.''\n\nFor the [[Slayer ring]] path, teleport to the [[Fremennik Slayer Dungeon]] or use the [[Fairy ring]] with (code {{Fairycode|ajr}}) to teleport outside the Dungeon entrance. Head north-east to a narrow passage and climb over some rocks ([[climbing boots]] required). Head north to the Secret Entrance that will place you on the lower level of the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]].\n\n====Inside the Stronghold====\n<blockquote>'''''Important note:''''' If you didn't rescue [[Eadgar]] during the [[Troll Stronghold]] quest, you will need to do so. He can be found in the prison in the Stronghold. Pickpocket [[Berry]] the sleeping guard to get the key to his cell. Once you've rescued him, he will be in the Trollheim cave on the hill. (Even if you have freed Eadgar, he will still be in the prison cell. If you can't pickpocket the [[Cell key 2]] from [[Berry]], you have previously freed Eadgar. Alternatively, you can check your quest log, and it will say \"I've rescued Godric and Mad Eadgar.\" if you have.)</blockquote>\nFrom the Secret Entrance, head north along the corridor, past the jail cells and sleeping guards to the stone staircase in the north-east corner. Head south and you'll see four [[Troll Cook]]s here – one of them will be called [[Burntmeat]]. Speak to him, and he will offer to tell you about [[goutweed]] in exchange for a human to cook in his stew.\n<blockquote>Consider doing the first section of the [[Troll Romance]] quest while in the area (the three trolls are just to the north-west of the kitchen).</blockquote>\n\n===Meeting Eadgar===\nTake the stairs next to Burntmeat and you will be on the upper level of the Stronghold. From here, follow the corridor north until you see the exit on the wall to the east, exit the Stronghold and run south-east to reach the base of [[Trollheim]] on the west side.\n\nClimb to the top of [[Trollheim]]. At the top, there is an unmarked cave entrance on the southern side of the summit. Enter the cave, and speak to [[Eadgar]] about [[goutweed]]. He will suggest that you speak to the [[Troll Cook]]. Fortunately, you already have; unfortunately, you need a human to feed to the trolls. Eadgar will then come up with a plan...\n\n===The parrot===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Climbing boots]], [[vodka]], [[pineapple chunks]], 10 [[grain]], 2 [[logs]], a [[tinderbox]], 5 [[raw chicken]]s, a [[pestle and mortar]], Herblore [[boost]] (if not level 31), and a [[ranarr potion (unf)]]. 10 grain may be picked while obtaining robes from [[Tegid]].''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' A [[Slayer ring]] or a [[Dramen staff]] for the fastest access to the troll prison, a [[games necklace]], or a [[combat bracelet]] if not.\nA Falador Teleport Tablet if you need to return to Taverley for the dirty clothes. ''\n\n[[Eadgar]] will tell you he needs a parrot in order to fool the [[troll]]s into thinking you've given them a human. Go to the [[zoo]] in [[Ardougne]], and talk to [[Parroty Pete]] at the northern part of the zoo near the [[wolf]] enclosure. Ask him both of the possible questions, and he will tell you that their favourite food is [[pineapple chunks]] and that they will get drunk if you feed them [[vodka]]. '''Do not''' accidentally drink the vodka or eat the pineapple chunks! Right click your pineapple chunks and use them on your vodka to make [[alco-chunks]], and then use them on the aviary hatch on the west side of the parrot cage. You'll obtain a [[drunk parrot]], and tell Parroty Pete that you will take it to the vet. (Do not drop the parrot or it will fly away. If this does happen, you can talk to Eadgar to retrieve it, However you cannot retrieve it if you have not visited him with the parrot yet.).\n\nWhile in Ardougne, it's also a good idea to pick up your logs, tinderbox, grain, raw chicken, pestle and mortar, and [[unfinished ranarr potion]] from the bank.\nTake the parrot to Eadgar. You need to make it look like a human, taste like a human, smell like a human, and talk like a human. (You must do these steps in order; however, you may hand in the items after hiding the parrot.)\n\n:Go back to Eadgar using your route of choice, to talk about the rest of his plan before proceeding to the next step.\n:If you pick a Thistle now, you can dry it on a fire on the way back to Eadgar. Scroll down to the [[#Truth serum|truth serum section]] to learn how to acquire a troll thistle.\n\n*'''Talk like a human''' - Go back to the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]], and head north through the corridor, then climb down the stone staircase, and unlock the prison door (no key required), finally climb down the second stone staircase to arrive at the prison cells. Go a bit further west and hide your parrot under the rack just north of the cells. Alternatively, use the [[fairy rings]] (code {{Fairycode|ajr}}) or a [[slayer ring]] to teleport to the [[Fremennik Slayer Dungeon]] and follow the north-east passage to the climbable rocks, then open the secret door to the north and you will be directly south of the jail cells. Then, head north until you get to the stone staircase, and then, head west and hide the parrot under the rack north of the cells.\n*:You will come back for the parrot later. Make sure that you check your Quest Log and talk to Eadgar before teleporting away.\n\n*'''Look/Taste like a human''' - Teleport out of Trollheim and get your 10 grain, 2 logs, tinderbox, 5 raw chicken, pestle and mortar, and unfinished ranarr potion.\n**Note for Ultimate Ironmen: You can make multiple trips with the items if you do not have the inventory space available to bring them in one trip.\n*'''Smell like a human''' - Go to [[Taverley]]. You will see [[Tegid]] washing robes in the lake. Talk to him, and ask for a [[dirty robe]]. Then, threaten him with talking to [[Sanfew]] or chopping down trees to get one. After this, if needed, pick 10 [[grain]] just south of Tegid to bring to [[Eadgar]]. Take all items to Eadgar and he will make the human substitute for you. \n**Consider doing the middle sections of the [[Troll Romance]] quest now to save time running back and forth.\n\n===Truth serum===\n'''''Recommended:''' Combat gear and supplies for fighting [[Arrg]] if returning to complete the last part of [[Troll Romance]] quest simultaneously.''\n\n'''Note:''' If you boosted your Herblore lvl to start the quest a Herblore of 31 is needed to make the troll truth potion.  \n[[File:Eadgar's Ruse - Troll thistle.png|thumb|220px|A thistle, hiding amongst the grass.]]\nAfter you've done all of this, [[Eadgar]] will tell you that you need to make a [[troll truth potion]] so that [[Burntmeat]] won't lie to you about [[Goutweed]]. Look near the grass patches around Eadgar's hill until you find a tiny [[Thistle (Trollheim)|thistle]] growing in one of them and pick it for a [[Troll thistle]]. It may take you a while, but keep searching. If unable to find it, one may find it helpful to world hop and check the grass directly north or directly west of the cave. The Thistle's name is yellow when displayed at the top-left of the game window.\n\nOnce you've found the troll thistle, make a fire with your third [[log]], and cook it to get a [[dried thistle]]. If you forgot a third log and/or tinderbox, there is a fire in the cave between the arena and Trollheim. Then, grind it with a [[pestle and mortar]] to make [[ground thistle]]. Finally, [[Greenman's ale|boost]] your Herblore level (if necessary) and add the ground thistle to your [[unfinished ranarr potion]] to make a [[troll potion]]. (If your character doesn't want to, check your quest journal!)\n\nTalk to Eadgar again. He will take the potion off of you and tell you that the parrot has had enough by now, so you can get it back from the troll jail. At this point it's recommended that you bank and grab some food for the next part of the quest. Go back to the prison cells in the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]], either through the back door to the jail via [[Fairy rings]], code '''{{Fairycode|ajr}}''' or with the [[Slayer ring]] teleport (bring climbing boots). If you chose not to bank, head back to the stronghold then north through the corridor, then climb down the stone staircase, and unlock the prison door, finally climb down the second stone staircase to arrive at the prison cells, search the rack to retrieve the parrot and then return to Eadgar.\n\n===Getting goutweed===\n[[File:Eadgar's Ruse - Goutweed map.png|thumb|left|200px|Guide to getting the Goutweed.]]\nAfter you give the parrot to [[Eadgar]], he will give you the [[Fake man]]. Go back to the cooks in the stronghold by going south of the entrance and then down the stairs, and give the dummy to [[Burntmeat]]. He'll give you a piece of [[burnt meat]] as a reward (which you can discard as it serves no purpose in the quest). He'll also tell you that the [[Goutweed]] is kept in the storeroom and that you can find the key by searching the Kitchen Drawers.\n* Consider doing the first section of the [[Troll Romance]] quest if not already previously started. \n\nSearch the drawers in the south-eastern corner of the room, which look like rocks, and once you have the [[storeroom key]], go down the stairs just to the north. This next part is the hardest as you will need to sneak past the guards. If one of them sees you, it will throw a rock at you, dealing 1-6 ranged damage, and you will be sent back to the entrance. [[Protect from Missiles]] blocks the damage, but it does not prevent getting kicked out.\n\nThe troll guards walk in cycles of 4, repeating. The easiest way to get a Goutweed is to click the crate with the Goutweed with run on as the two guards closest to the door are about to pass each other. Two of the 4 cycles should succeed using this method, and there is a 4 tile window where you can do this. If you get caught the cycle does not change like with [[Sorceress's Garden]] so  you can keep trying. If done correctly this should result in a Goutweed every 2 runs. If you prefer you can just click the crate and try to brute force it, players may expect to obtain somewhere in the vicinity of one Goutweed per 5-10 runs using this method. Since you will be running a lot and being thrown out a lot, it is recommended to keep Protect from Missiles on and to bring a few prayer-restoring and energy-restoring items.\n\nIf you wish to utilise the intended mechanics, the best way is to use the two most eastern guards as an indicator of when to move to the second safespot. To do this turn on your run and wait until one of the two guards rounds the northern corner of the boxes that they rotate around. As soon as this happens run to the second safespot. Note that the darker coloured troll patrolling the small section of boxes must also be avoided. Once in the second safespot simply run to the one of the safespots adjacent to the crate when the guard that comes north and closest to you turns west, and then click on the Goutweed crate.\n\nThe next way to do this is to use the safespots, which are dead ends surrounded by three crates. Time your movement and run to the first safespot, then wait for your chance to run to the second. You can use the position of the troll guards as an indication of when to move, as the placements of the guards will repeat after one or two cycles. Wait at the second safespot until you get the chance to run to the Goutweed crate and search it. Be careful not to simply click ''search Goutweed Crate'' as this will get you stuck on the sleeping troll instead of going up to the crate. Make sure you click on the spot adjacent to the crate, and ''then'' click search Goutweed crate. You'll be kicked out after you get one piece of Goutweed. Also, if you plan to do [[Dream Mentor]] or [[Dragon Slayer II]] at any point, it is recommended to get two extra Goutweed as it is a required item in those quests ('''Note:''' You can grab multiple Goutweed if you are quick enough to skip the dialogue and click on the crate).\n\nGive the Goutweed to [[Sanfew]] back in Taverley by clicking on the \"ask other question\" option NOT the \"talk about sanfew serum\". This will complete the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Eadgar's Ruse\n|image = [[File:Eadgar's Ruse reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Herblore|11,000}} [[Herblore]] [[experience]]\n*The ability to grow and steal [[Goutweed]], which can be traded with Sanfew for herbs.\n*1 Burnt Meat\n*The ability to use the [[Trollheim Teleport]] spell.\n*The ability to use a [[Scroll of redirection]] to redirect a [[Teleport to house (tablet)|Teleport to house tablet]] to Trollheim.\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Eadgar's Ruse is required for the following:\n*[[Dream Mentor]]\n*[[My Arm's Big Adventure]]\n*[[Fremennik Diary#Hard|Hard Fremennik Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n{{Eadgar's Ruse}}"

He is at the south-west part of the zoo, just south of the scorpion cage. He'll tell you about a delivery of a northern ferret who managed to escape his cage while unloading. He will ask you to contact a huntsman called [[Nickolaus]] who agreed to capture another ferret, but he hasn't heard from him for some time. He will ask you to look for him. Finally, ask ''\"Sure. Any idea where I should start looking?\"'', and upon Charlie's answer, the quest begins. Charlie will tell you to start around the mountains just west of the [[Gnome Stronghold]].\n\n===Eagles' Peak===\n{{Map|2319,3503|r=3|mtype=square|align=right|width=220|height=220|caption=The location of the tent.}}\nHead to [[Eagles' Peak (mountain)|Eagles' Peak]], which is west of the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]]. If you have access to the [[fairy ring]] network, code {{Fairycode|AKQ}} gets you there relatively fast. You can also use a [[necklace of passage]] and choose the second option \"The outpost\" and head north-west. At the base of the mountain on the north-west side, you should find a tent, but Nickolaus is no where to be found. Inspect the books on the ground, and you will receive a [[bird book]]. Try to read the book, and a [[metal feather]] will fall out of the book.\n\nFollow the path up to the peak, which starts on the south side of the mountain, or use the [[Agility shortcut]] right beside the tent. At the top is a door (disguised as a rocky outcrop) with an inscription of a feather on the north side.\n[[File:Eagles' Peak Dungeon map.png|thumb|left|The Eagles' Peak Dungeon map.]]\n[[File:Eagles' Peak Shout nikolaus.png|thumb|220px|Nickolaus is trapped by a giant eagle.]]\nUse the metal feather from the book to open the door. Then, go inside. A few steps into the cave, there is a [[feathered journal]] on the north side which contains some interesting info, but it is not critical to the quest. The passages split to three tunnels to other areas and another metal door (used later) and to a ledge over a large open area. '''Go the southern route''' where you see the giant feathers laying on the ground. Nickolaus is across the ledge, and you must click to shout to him. A [[cutscene]] will start when you shout to Nickolaus, who is trapped across a chasm by a giant eagle that will not let him out of the cave. Continue through the dialogue and ask if there is any way you can help.\n\n===Eagle disguise===\n{{Needed|10 [[eagle feather]]s, [[swamp tar]], a [[yellow dye]], and 50 [[coins]].}}\n\n[[Nickolaus]] tells you to make a disguise for him. Talk to him about eagles—mention that he is trapped and offer to help. Gather 10 [[eagle feather]]s (piles of giant feathers can be found near the area after you speak to Nickolaus and throughout the cave).\n\nTeleport to [[Varrock]] and go to the [[Fancy Dress Shop]] in the south-east corner (inside of the gated area). Ask specifically about a couple of bird costumes, and [[Asyff]] will make you two giant eagle costumes using the 10 [[giant feather]]s, [[swamp tar]], a [[yellow dye]], and 50 [[coins]]. Each costume consists of an [[eagle cape]] and a [[fake beak]].\n\nWith the two sets of disguises, return to the [[Eagles' Peak (mountain)|Eagles' Peak]] [[Eagles' Peak Dungeon|dungeon]] and shout to Nickolaus again. He wants you to bring the clothes to him.\n\n===Unlocking the eagle door===\n[[File:Eagles' Peak Eagle door.png|thumb|220px|The locked Eagle door.]]\nGo to the south-west extremity of the [[Eagles' Peak Dungeon|dungeon]], and then take the east path. You will find a large [[Stone door (Eagles' Peak)|stone door]] with an eagle marking, which leads to [[Nickolaus]]. You cannot open the door in this state. Three feathers ([[bronze feather|bronze]], [[Silver feather|silver]], and [[Golden feather|gold]]) are required to be able to open the door.\n\n====Bronze feather====\n[[File:Eagles' Peak Bronze feather.png|thumb|220px|The bronze feather on a pedestal.]]\nWest of the eagle door is a tunnel. The tunnel leads to a room with a stone pedestal on which sits a [[bronze feather]]. Attempt to take the feather, and the obvious net trap will lift it upwards. Now, operate all four winches in each of the corners, causing the net trap to break. The pedestal will fall down, and it is possible to take the bronze feather. Leave and follow the directions to the [[silver feather]] cave.\n\n:'''Note:''' You cannot operate the winches before the net trap has activated.\n\n====Silver feather====\n[[File:Eagles' Peak silver feather trail.png|thumb|220px|The trail leading from the pedestal.]]\nA bit further north, a second tunnel leads into another dungeon room, this time with an empty pedestal. You will need to have 27 [[Hunter]] to successfully inspect the empty pedestal. Inspect the pedestal, and a partial trail will appear. Follow the trail, and inspect the heap of rocks in the direction the trail points to. If you are correct, the trail from the pedestal is shown to the heap of rocks. Investigate rocks near where the trail ends—if correct, another trail will appear. Repeat until the trail leads to a tunnel in the wall. Click the tunnel in the wall, and a level-13 [[Kebbit (Eagles' Peak)|kebbit]] will attack. Kill it, or use the right-click \"threaten\" option, and it will drop the [[silver feather]]. If you lose or destroy the feather, you will not have to kill or threaten the kebbit again; simply search the tunnel to reclaim it.\n\n====Gold feather====\n[[File:Eagles' Peak Golden feather.png|thumb|220px|The golden feather on a pedestal.]]\n('''Note:''' If the puzzle gets messed up, there is a reset lever outside of the chamber.)\n\nThe third tunnel entrance is in the north-east corner of the main [[Eagles' Peak Dungeon|dungeon]]. You need to retrieve the gold feather from the pedestal at the end of a long corridor due west from the entrance, but the way is blocked by metal eagles and wing-shaped stone gates. The birds can be moved by putting bird seeds in the bird feeder close to the point where you need the eagle to go to. The eagle wings can be moved by pulling a [[lever]]. There are four levers and five metal eagles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Lever location\n!Operates on eagle wings\n|-\n|Centre of dungeon\n|East and north-west\n|-\n|East of dungeon\n|North-west\n|-\n|South-west dungeon\n|North-west and south\n|-\n|North-west of dungeon\n|Corridor to feather room\n|}\n\nTo start, take-from the [[birdseed holder]] to get [[odd bird seed]] near the entrance to place in bird feeders. You'll need six to finish the puzzle. Follow the visual guide below which lists the sequence or the steps outlined below the visual guide.\n\nYou need to clear access to the north-west lever, by operating the south-west and centre levers. The north-west lever unlocks the eastern part of the area and gives access to the east lever. Although operating this lever clears a critical eagle wing blocking the corridor to the [[Golden feather (Eagles' Peak)|golden feather]], there are still blocking objects from the actions to get to the east lever. Use the table above to remove any remaining objects blocking the corridor.\n\n[[File:Eagles' Peak - gold feather puzzle solution.png|thumb|300px|Visual guide to obtaining the Golden Feather.]]\nTo solve the puzzle, follow these steps. Step numbers correlate with the picture to the right:\n\n#First pull the lever, which is just north-west of the start.\n#Walk to the south-eastern part of the [[Eagles' Peak Dungeon|dungeon]]. Then, place some bird seed in most south-eastern bird feeder.\n#Place some bird seed in the bird feeder next to the one you just filled.\n#Pull the south-eastern lever.\n#Walk back to the handle you pulled the first time, just north-west of the start, and push it back to its original position again.\n#Walk to the southern part of the dungeon, and put bird seed in the feeder south of the lever you just pulled and east of the lever in the southern part (the bird coming from the north should get blocked by the stone gate).\n#Pull the lever in the southern part of the dungeon.\n#Go back to the lever you started at, which is just north-west of the start, and put bird feed in the feeder.\n#Pull the lever in the north-western part of the dungeon.\n#Go to the southern part of the dungeon, and put bird feed in the bird feeder closest to the lever there.\n#Place some feed in the bird feeder in the corner of the rails to the east of the bird feeder from Step 10.\n#Retrieve the [[Golden feather (Eagles' Peak)|golden feather]] from the pedestal.\n\n[[File:Eagles' Peak Pass eagle.png|thumb|220px|Walking past the eagle with a disguise.]]\nAfter collecting all three feathers (bronze, silver, and gold), use each feather on the eagle door to open it. Walk to [[Nickolaus]] and wear the full eagle disguise to \"walk past\" the eagle guarding Nickolaus. Not wearing a disguise will cause the eagle to hit you for a small amount of damage.\n\nAfter a short conversation, Nickolaus requests you to meet him back at the camp.\n\nA bit further east are three huge eagles ([[polar eagle|polar]], [[jungle eagle|jungle]], and [[desert eagle|desert]]). After the quest, they can be used as a transport system to the other [[Hunter area]]s from the South Woodland Hunter Area.\n\n===Finishing up===\n[[File:Catching the Ferret.png|thumb|220px|Catching the ferret for the zoo.]]\nGo back out of the [[Eagles' Peak (location)|Eagles' Peak]] [[Eagles' Peak Dungeon|dungeon]] and go down the rock climb. On the ground where the tent you were at before is, talk to [[Nickolaus]] and he'll teach you how to catch [[ferret]]s. You do not need a [[box trap]] for this part of the quest. If you click on the [[cutscene]] where you retrieve the box trap, you will not catch the ferret. If you accidentally release the ferret, you are able to catch a new one with the box trap Nickolaus has given you.\nGo back to [[Ardougne Zoo]] with the ferret you caught. Talk to [[Charlie]] who gives the [[quest reward]].\n\n'''Note for diary completions:''' After completing the quest, return to Eagles' Peak with a [[rope]]. Riding each eagle to their destinations and then back to Eagles' Peak will complete medium [[diary tasks]] in the [[Fremennik Diary|Fremennik]], [[Desert Diary|Desert]], and [[Western Provinces Diary|Western Provinces]].\n\nA fast way to get to Eagles' Peak is to teleport to Eagle's Eyrie with a [[necklace of passage]], then using a rope found nearby on the eagle to travel. '''45 [[Strength]]''' is required to unlock the entrance to the [[desert eagle]]s.\n\nLastly, if you want to unlock the [[jungle eagle]]'s nest, bring a [[teasing stick]], [[thatching spar]], or [[garden cane]] to grow the vine for the entrance. ('''DO THIS LAST''', as the vine takes approximately 40 minutes to grow and can't immediately be used to get back.)\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Eagles' Peak\n|image = [[File:Eagles' Peak reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards =\n*{{SCP|Hunter|2500|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*Ability to use [[box trap]]s\n*Access to the [[Eagle transport system]]\n*Captured ferrets can be used to flush [[rabbit]]s from their holes, allowing them to be caught in [[rabbit snare]]s\n*A box trap\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Eagles' Peak is required for the following:\n*[[At First Light]]\n*[[Medium Desert Diary]]\n*[[Medium Fremennik Diary]]\n*[[Medium Western Provinces Diary]]\n*[[Medium Kourend & Kebos Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The giant [[Kebbit (Eagles' Peak)|kebbit]] that jumps out of the cave with the [[silver feather]] is likely a reference to the killer rabbit in the ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' film. If choosing to threaten the kebbit, your character can taunt the kebbit with a line from the film, \"Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!\"\n** This same insult was also used during [[The Fremennik Isles]] quest.\n* {{UD|Game Integrity Changes: Part 1|An update}} on [[28 June]] [[2018]] made box traps require partial completion of Eagles' Peak to use, previously there were no quest requirements.\n* Eagles' Peak was the first quest with a [[Hunter]] skill requirement.

Search the [[bookcase (Elemental Workshop I)|bookcase]] on the east wall to receive a book called \"Battered Book\", read it to start the quest.\n\nThe book speaks about an ore that was discovered in the [[Fifth Age]], able to concentrate elemental energy into itself. Following this revelation, [[Elemental Workshop (location)|a workshop]] was created in Seers' Village, calling all craftsmen to invent new devices using this unique ore. Unfortunately, realising the destructive potential of the ore, the workshop had to be closed down, along with details of any processes involved destroyed.\nAfter reading the book, use a bladed weapon like a scimitar, dagger or knife on it to get a [[battered key]], turning the tome into a [[slashed book]]. There is a knife spawn in the house north of the church if you forgot to bring one. Do not drop the slashed book. Enter the north building with the [[anvil]] icon, and use the key on the odd-looking wall with the strange crack. Climb down the stairs you find there to enter a [[Elemental Workshop (location)|workshop]].[[File:Elemental Workshop (location) map.png|thumb|left|200px|A map of the [[Elemental Workshop (location)|dungeon]].]]\n[[File:Elemental Workshop I - Filling a stone bowl.png|thumb|195x195px|A player filling a stone bowl with lava.]]\n[[File:Elemental Workshop I Location of Leather.png|alt=Located in the north-west section of crates.|thumb|195x195px|The crate containing leather.]]\n[[File:Elemental Workshop I Location of Stone Bowl.png|alt=Located in the north eastern part of the central area.|thumb|195x195px|The crate containing a stone bowl.]]\n\n===Restarting===\nFirst, head into the northern chamber. There are two water controls to the east and west of the water wheel. \n\n* Turn the Eastern water control first to display green \n* Turn the Western water control so that it also displays green.\n* Then pull the lever near the water wheel. The water wheel now starts spinning.\n\n'''If you do not already have leather and a needle:''' The leather can be found in a [[Crate (Elemental Workshop I, leather)|crate]] in the north-western part of the central room, while the needle may be found in a [[Crate (Elemental Workshop I, needle)|stacked crate]] in the western room.  \n\nNext, head into the eastern chamber. Fix the bellows with a spool of thread and leather, then pull the lever next to it. The bellows should now start pumping air. \n\nHead into the western cavern and attempt to mine an elemental rock. The rock springs to life, yells, and attacks you. Kill the [[earth elemental]], and pick up the [[elemental ore]] that it drops. \n\n'''Note:''' Earth elementals only drop ores when awoken by an attempt to mine them.\n\n'''Tip: Kill two more if you want to save time for [[Elemental Workshop II]], or three more if you also want a [[Mind shield]] after completing that quest.''' \n\n'''Note:''' One of the [[Easy Kandarin Diary|Kandarin easy]] tasks is to kill one of each elemental (must kill a regular Earth elemental, not the ones that can be mined first) but it is entirely optional for this quest,\n\nFinally, head back to the central chamber. Search the [[Boxes (Elemental Workshop)|boxes]] north-east of the hatch to obtain [[a stone bowl]]. Fill it with lava from the lava trough in the southern chamber, then use it on the [[furnace]] to the east in the same chamber. The inside of the furnace should now glow orange. This furnace cannot be used as a regular furnace - it can only be used to smelt elemental bars.\n\n===A lost art===\nProceed to use the elemental ore, along with four [[coal]], on the furnace to obtain an [[elemental metal]]. If you receive the message \"''The furnace needs to be hotter in order to be of any use,\"'' \n\nreturn to the northern and eastern rooms to ensure that the water wheel is spinning and the bellow is moving.\n\nPlayers who receive the message \"The furnace is too hot and would ruin this metal\" should use the elemental ore on the furnace, not the coal.\n\nWith the [[slashed book]] in your inventory, go back to the centre and use the elemental metal on the workbench to make an [[elemental shield]]. If you are unable to craft the shield, destroy the slashed book and obtain a new one from the bookcase.\n\nNote: You may make as many shields as you want so long as you return with the battered key, slashed book and 4 coal to smelt with the elemental ore. The elemental shield CAN be sold on the grand exchange for {{Coins|{{GEP|Elemental shield}}}} gold.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Elemental Workshop I\n|image = [[File:Elemental Workshop I reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*{{SCP|Crafting|5,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*{{SCP|Smithing|5,000}} [[Smithing]] experience\n*Access to the [[Elemental Workshop (location)|Elemental Workshop]]\n*An [[elemental shield]], as well as the ability to make and wield them\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Elemental Workshop I is required for the following:\n*[[Elemental Workshop II]] <sup>[[Elemental Workshop II/Quick guide|(Quick guide)]]</sup>\n*An easy and medium task in the [[Kandarin Diary]]\n:'''Note:''' You may want to defeat one of each of the four Elementals for a Kandarin Diary requirement.

Search the '''North Facing''' bookcase on the east wall (South of the two chests. Not the one directly beside them however) of the south-eastern bookcases, and you'll find a [[beaten book]] with a scroll in it as a bookmark. Read the book and then the scroll, and then head to [[Seers' Village]]. '''Do not''' get rid of this book before the end of the quest; if you do, you will not be able to make the helmet out of the [[primed mind bar]].\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n===The key===\n[[File:Elemental Workshop II - Hatch key location.png|thumb|220px|The hatch key location.]]\nIf you don't already have the [[battered key]], head to the building south-west of [[Seers' Village]] [[Bank]], and search the north-east [[bookcase (Elemental Workshop I)|bookcase]] to get a [[slashed book]] and a battered key. Go to the workshop in the building with the [[anvil]], and let yourself in the same way as in the [[Elemental Workshop I]] [[Quests|quest]]. \n\nNext, go into the northern [[water elemental]] room and search the machinery to the south-west side of the room. You will receive the key used to unlock the hatch in the main room.\n\n:'''Note:''' If you do not read the scroll, you will not get the search option for the machinery.\n:'''Note:''' Before you go down, quickly \"mine\" two [[elemental ore]]s (three if you desire a [[mind shield]]) from the west room, and smelt them into [[elemental metal]]s in the south room (you will need 4 [[coal]] per elemental bar). Ironmen may find coal at the [[Coal Trucks|mine]] west of Seers' Village; 20 [[Agility]] is required to access it through a [[Log balance (Coal Trucks)|shortcut]].\n\n===Making repairs===\n[[File:Elemental Workshop II - Junction pipe placement.png|left|thumb|190px|Pipe connections]]\n[[File:Elemental Workshop II - Cog placement.png|thumb|190px|Cog placements]]\nGo to the middle of the room and use the key on the locked hatch. Once you're downstairs, you need to fix the machinery. First, go to the \"[[Schematic crate]]\" (directly beside [[an old lever]]) to the south and take both the  [[Crane schematic|crane]] and the [[lever schematic]]s. Then go back upstairs and use '''one''' of your bars on the workbench and make the [[crane claw]]. '''Do not make a helmet yet!''' \n\nMake sure you only make one, as the default will be make all!\n\nNow, go back down and pull the south-western lever right next to the [[old crane]], and then use the claw on the crane.\n\nNext, head up the small stairs to your west (not up the hatch, but onto the metal construct) to get to the upper level. Open the [[junction box]] in the west to work on the pipes for the press (click on the ends you want to connect). You'll want to arrange them as seen on the left. \n\n'''Explanation of the solution:''' The correct solution is worked out from the clue given by the lever schematic as well as by seeing how the 6 pipes are connected to the back of the junction box. These correspond to the pipe ends in the interface. The lever schematic shows that the middle pipe coming from the lever, top-right in the interface, allows water to flow towards the lever and must therefore be connected to the large water supply pipe, top-middle in the interface. Next, the 2 remaining pipes coming from the lever, bottom-right and bottom-middle in the interface, must be connected to the 2 pipes coming from the press, top-left and bottom-left in the interface. The only combination that works is bottom-right to top-left and bottom-middle to bottom-left.\n\nFor the next two parts, you'll need to search some crates in the bottom and upstairs area. The [[small cog]], [[medium cog]], [[large cog]] and [[Pipe (Elemental Workshop II)|piece of pipe]] are located randomly in crates for each player. However, only certain crates contain items: on the bottom floor try searching the double-stacked crates next to the large exit staircase, the single crate north-west by the stairwell down, the double-stacked crate east of the west water valve, the double-stacked crates south-east, and the crate next to the schematics crate. Upstairs try searching the double-stacked crate south-east above the [[old crane]] and the double-stacked crate directly north-west of the [[junction box]]. If searching a crate does not yield an \"It's empty.\" message or produce an item, it is not possible to find an item within. Once you have found all 3 cogs and the [[Pipe (Elemental Workshop II)|piece of pipe]], you can stop searching the crates. If you lose one of the items before using it you can retrieve it in the same crate it was found previously. \n\nUse the pipe on the broken pipe upstairs on the northernmost point of the scaffolding. Then for the cogs, take them back down the steps to the [[wind tunnel]] on the east side of the track. On the side of the wind tunnel are three [[Cog (Elemental Workshop)|pins]] (under 2 [[Tunnel wall#Arrow right|yellow directional arrows]]). By using the cogs on the machine pins, you want to stick the small one on the upper-left pin, the medium one on the lower left, and the large one on the right.\n\n===Operating the machine===\n[[File:Elemental Workhop II - Making a primed bar.png|thumb|One of the many steps to creating a primed bar.]]\n{{Checklist|\n*Place your [[elemental metal]] on the [[jig cart]], which should be on the south crane right now. (If it is not, you must have already pulled the lever with the [[Mine cart sign|yellow cart-sign]] - keep operating it, until the cart completes the circle around the room and arrives again.)\n*The crane\n**The west lever (near the crane) will raise and lower the crane, and the east one (also near the crane) will rotate the crane. Raise the crane, rotate it, lower it to dip it into the lava and raise it back out. The bar should now be glowing orange.\n**Rotate the crane back, lower it and raise it again to deposit the bar on the jig.\n**:'''Note:''' Make sure to lower the crane and then '''raise it again''' in order to correctly deposit the bar. Not doing so will cause the bar to remain on the crane.\n*Pull the lever right behind you, by the yellow sign (north of the crane) to move the cart to the next station. Remember this lever, you will need to use it to move the cart after each step.\n*Go to where the cart now is and pull the lever to the east, north-west of the yellow sign. The bar will be flattened by a [[steam press]].\n*Go back to the yellow-sign lever and move the cart forward again.\n*If you haven't already fixed the pipe, go upstairs (not up the hatch, but onto the metal construct), and use the [[pipe (Elemental Workshop II)|pipe piece]] you found on the pipes to the north (they have a hole) to fix them and go down the stairs again.\n*The [[water tank]]\n**You will see [[an old lever]], a [[corkscrew lever]], and two [[Water valve (Elemental Workshop)|water valves]].\n**Pull the old lever to open the door, then turn the corkscrew lever twice to pull the cart into the tank. Close the door again with the old lever.\n**Make sure the eastern valve is closed, then open up the western valve (between two stacks of crates). The bar should turn blue once it gets cooled by the water. If it does not, the eastern valve is open.\n**Close the western valve again, then open the eastern one to let the water out and close it down again.\n**:'''Note:''' If the eastern valve reports that it is sucking air, you skipped step 6 (Fixing the pipe).\n**Open the door with the old lever, turn the corkscrew twice to deposit the cart back on the track, close the door again using the old lever. The cart will not move forward again while the door is open.\n*Pull the yellow-sign lever again to move the cart to the next station.\n*Turn on the [[fan blade|fan]] by pulling the lever next to it, and then turn it back off. When it is dry, the bar turns white.\n*:'''Note:''' If the fan reports that it is sucking air <!-- Maybe not correct, that is what a fan does right? -->, the cogs are not correct.\nPull old lever to turn off fan or cart will not move forward in the next step.\n*Go back and pull the lever to advance the cart again.\n*Pick up the [[primed bar]]!\n}}\nDo this twice if you want the [[Mind shield|shield]].\n\n===Finishing up===\n[[File:Elemental Workshop II - Extractor hat.gif|thumb|x180px|A bit of mind draining.]]\nGo down one more level to where there are two doors, one with the mind symbol and the other with the body symbol. Go into the mind room (nearest), and place your bar on the [[extractor gun]] and operate the [[extractor hat]] next to it. A part of you will be drained into the bar turning it into a [[Mind bar|primed mind bar]]. This will temporarily lower your [[Magic]] level by 20. \n\nNOTE: You can power multiple bars while here (to make shield at same time upon returning 2 levels up) but each time will drain your Magic by 20 (ie. 2 bars in a row will be -40 Magic).\n\nNow, you simply need to pick up the bar from the extractor gun, and go back up to the workshop, and make a [[mind helmet]] out of the bar you just made, and the quest is complete. '''MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE BEATEN BOOK IN YOUR INVENTORY OR YOU WILL MAKE A MIND SHIELD.'''\n\nAt this point you will also be able to make a [[Mind shield]], but this will not complete the quest, only making a Mind helmet will do so.\n\n*'''NOTE:''' You need the [[slashed book]] in your inventory to make a mind shield. Using a bar on the anvil without it will make a second mind helmet.\n*'''Note:''' Both the mind shield and helmet can be sold on the grand exchange for {{Coins|{{GEP|Mind shield}}}} and {{Coins|{{GEP|Mind helmet}}}} respectively.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Elemental Workshop II\n|image=[[File:Elemental Workshop II reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp=1\n|rewards=*{{SCP|Smithing|7,500}} [[Smithing]] experience\n*{{SCP|Crafting|7,500}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*The ability to make and use elemental mind equipment\n**To make a [[mind shield]]: have the [[slashed book]] from the [[Elemental Workshop I]] quest in your inventory, then smith a [[Mind bar|primed mind bar]] into a mind shield\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Elemental Workshop II is required for the following:\n*[[Medium Kandarin Diary]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*When you are downstairs in the corridor that has the mind door, a body door can be seen further down. This is a hint towards the {{RSL|Elemental Workshop III}} quest, which was released in ''Runescape'' in 2010. The armour reward from it was the {{RSL|Body body}}.\n\n{{Elemental Workshop II}}"

The simplest way of getting there is to travel with the free ferry south-west of Al Kharid to the Ruins of Unkah, and to run north from there. Alternatively, if you have a Pharaoh's Sceptre you can teleport to Jaldraocht (the Ancient Pyramid) and run west. Have at least four free inventory spaces at the start of the quest. You need to buy a Shantay Pass (5 coins) from the guard to exit the Ruins of Ankah and may need more if you come back to buy water from him. \n\nLazim introduces himself as a down-on-his-luck sculptor who once made statues for royalty but has been unable to hold a chisel since an unspecified accident. He wants your help building a statue to decorate the desolate area. Agree to help him. He will ask you to gather 32 kilograms' worth of [[sandstone]] from the nearby [[Bandit Camp Quarry|quarry]].\n\nThere are four sizes of sandstone: 1&nbsp;kg, 2&nbsp;kg, 5&nbsp;kg, and 10&nbsp;kg. You can use your [[chisel]] on big blocks to make them smaller, if necessary. At a higher [[Mining]] level, you'll get bigger blocks. Speak to Lazim and tell him you have the sandstone once you have finished. You will have to give the pieces to him one by one, eliciting some caustic remarks.\n\n===Shaky foundations===\n[[File:Building the statue.png|thumb|The statue needs a head.]]\nAfter you've given Lazim exactly 32&nbsp;kg, he will attach them with magic to make a [[sandstone (32kg)|32kg sandstone block]]. Use your chisel on the block that he gives you to make a [[sandstone base]]. Talk to him again, and then use it on the flat ground next to him.\n\nYou now need 20 kilograms of sandstone for the body. After you've given him the required amount and he gives you the [[sandstone (20kg)|20kg sandstone block]], use your chisel on it to make a [[sandstone body]] and then attach it to the base. Lazim will grow increasingly angrier with your performance. He seems to be still missing something and tells you to chisel the statue a bit more. Talk to him again; he seems impatient, expecting something to have happened. He decides the statue is only missing a head, to be made out of granite from the same quarry. He lets you decide whose head the statue should bear. (If you want, you can tell him about the events of [[The Giant Dwarf]] if you have completed that quest; he will not allow you to use the head of your chosen company director because you no longer remember how it looks.)\n[[File:Completed statue.png|thumb|left|200px|The completed statue.]]\nYou now have to choose the [[Stone head|head]] of the statue. You may choose between either your own head (which he will not allow either), Lazim's head, a camel's head or a god's head, with the choice of [[Zamorak]] or [[Icthlarin]]. Mine a  5&nbsp;kg piece of [[granite]] (not sandstone!). Chisel it into a head (if you sculpt the wrong head, Lazim will insult you but allow you to change your choice at the cost of the granite) and keep the other in your inventory for later in the quest. In order to save time later, mine a second 5kg piece of granite and some clay as well. There is a general store at the [[Bandit Camp (Kharidian Desert)|Bandit Camp]] where you can buy a bucket of water to use on the clay to make it soft (The empty buckets can be given to [[Drew]]). Also mine a piece of coal if you don't have one already, as you will need it later.\n\n'''Note:''' Mining granite is a [[Hard Desert Tasks|Hard Desert Diary task]].\n\nUse the head on the statue. It will fall through the ground, creating a large hole. As you peer into it, Lazim pushes you inside. You hurt your duodenum and appear in an ancient temple below next to the sculptor and broken statue. Talk to Lazim, who says everything has gone according to plan. You deduce that he is not in fact a sculptor but promises you a share of whatever treasure you find in the temple if you help him. He explains you have fallen to the bottom floor and need to make your way to the top one. The doors in the temple do not require keys but stone limbs instead; he suggests you mine or chisel them off the statue.\n\n===The Camel, the Witch and the Prison===\n[[File:Removing statue parts.png|thumb|Removing the statue parts.]]\nUse your chisel or pickaxe on the statue to get a [[stone left arm]], [[stone right arm]], [[stone left leg]] and [[stone right leg]], which you'll use as keys to unlock the doors to the rooms. Lazim also returns the [[stone head]] to you, which had fallen off the statue. Should you need to exit the temple, the ladder next to the statue's remains leads to a pile of sand you can climb to the surface. This will unlock this entrance permanently.\n\nGo around the outside track to each of the rooms through the doors, as the door in the western corridor is locked. Each door requires one of the limbs. Opening a door will give you a headache and trigger a cutscene. You should travel anticlockwise for the cut scenes to be in the correct order and collect the sigils from the pedestals as you go. The first shows a mysterious woman called [[Enakhra]] cheering at the completion of the temple for her lord. The second, four [[Knight (Enakhra's Lament)|Knights of Avarrocka]] come to destroy the sorceress and her temple, only to be slain effortlessly by Enakhra's magic. One knight is left alive, frozen in ice. In the third cutscene, a camel-headed man named [[Akthanakos]] apparently convinces Enakhra to defect from Zamorak, for whom the temple is but who would rather have a weapon, to 'their side'. She pretends to agree, upon which the man leaves. In the next cutscene, she is shown animating bones to a [[Skeleton (Enakhra's Lament)|weak skeleton]] in an attempt to create a weapon for Zamorak and is not satisfied.\n\nAs you pass the bigger rooms along the way, take the [[Z sigil]], [[R sigil]] and [[K sigil]], which together with the [[M sigil]] in the room in which you started make up the consonants of 'Zamorak'. You may also want to climb the ladders and sandpiles to unlock all four secret entrances. After you've unlocked all of the outer doors with the four limbs, go towards the middle and use the sigil to unlock the door. You may also unlock the other three doors. (This will permanently remove the sigils.)\n\nGo up the ladder. A [[magic barrier]] is blocking your progress and there is a curious pedestal next to the ladder. Go back to Lazim and ask him about it. He asks whether there is a recess in it, which you confirm. He suggests placing the statue head into it. Try doing so; it will fit, but not perfectly. If you return to Lazim for advice, he says you should make a mould of the recess somehow and use that as a template to make another head from granite. If you did not bring soft clay, regular [[clay]] can be mined in the quarry. Take the ladder next to Lazim up and climb up the sand pile to resurface. There is a [[general store]] to the north where you can purchase a bucket, bowl or jug with water and use it on the clay to make soft clay. When you return, climb down the secret entrance a few tiles east of the hole you fell down to get back into the temple.\n\nUse soft clay on the pedestal to make a [[camel mould (p)|positive camel head mould]] and then use the chisel on a piece of medium-sized [[granite]] (5&nbsp;kg) to make a new [[stone head]]. Place this granite camel head into the pedestal to be greeted by another cutscene. It shows Akthanakos standing by the pedestal, confused. Enakhra reveals her betrayal and freezes him, expressing her loyalty to Zamorak. \n\n'''Optional:''' Use a second soft clay on the granite head on the pedestal to make a camel mask for yourself, but only after you've crafted and placed in the new stone head.\n\n====Cutscenes====\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nFile:Enakhra completes temple.png|Enakhra completes the temple.\nFile:Attempting to kill Enakhra.png|The Avarrockians attempt to kill Enakhra...\nFile:Knights killed.png|...but are vanquished.\nFile:Meeting Akthanakos.png|Akthanakos attempts to convert her to his side.\nFile:Creating weapons for Zamorak.png|Enakhra's love for Zamorak is endless and she attempts to create weapons for him.\nFile:Enakhra and Akthanakos.png|Enakhra tricks Akthanakos that she's changed...\nFile:Enakhra freezes Akthanakos.png|...and freezes him when he is distracted.\n</gallery>\n\n===The four elements of Enakhra===\nLazim will appear next to you after the cutscene, complimenting you on opening the doors. He explains the [[magic barrier]] will not let you through but it may open if you solve each of the four puzzles in the surrounding rooms. You will know you have succeeded because the corresponding globes on the pedestal will be lit. You may wish to start with the blood room, as it will unlock advice about the other ones.\n\n====Smoke====\nTake the north-east corridor and examine the [[furnace (Enakhra's Lament)|furnace]]. Its grate is blocked and requires a strong blast of air to clear. Use a [[wind spell]], bolt or stronger, on the furnace to clear out the room.\n\n====Shadow====\nTake the south-east corridor and investigate each [[brazier (Enakhra's Lament)|brazier]] to see what kind of fire used to burn there. The items are: [[logs]], [[oak logs]], [[willow logs]], [[maple logs]], a [[candle]], and [[coal]]. All items except for coal can be gathered in the vicinity of [[Catherby]] and the [[Seers' Village]], whilst coal is mined in the desert quarry. (If you have lit the candle previously, the room prevents you from extinguishing it. Exit to the main corridor to extinguish it.)\n\n'''{{Colour|red|Warning}}:''' Standing too long in this room without lighting any braziers will do damage due to [[darkness]]! \n\n====Blood====\nTake the north-west corridor and talk to the old knight [[Pentyn]], frozen by a magical spell. He believes you are a shapeshifting [[Mahjarrat]] there to torture him again. He explains he is a Knight of Avarrocka and has been frozen, wounded and hungry for many years. Give him your [[bread]], [[pie]], [[cake]], [[pizza]] or [[baked potato]] with topping. Make sure to right-click and use it on him, rather than left-click to eat. He will reminisce about his daughter, who had been learning to cook the given food, and thanks you for the memory. He'll still be stuck, but will no longer be in hunger.\n\nHe will also offer advice on the other rooms. The frozen fountain did not yield to fire nor swords and is likely magical in nature. The furnace produces choking fumes and requires a good breeze to clear. The fires in the dark room will have gone out since he last saw them and require relighting.\n\n====Ice====\nTake the south-west corridor to find a [[crust of ice|frozen fountain]] that will require more than a regular fire to thaw. Cast your [[Fire Bolt]], [[Fire Blast|Blast]] or [[Fire Wave|Wave]] on the frozen fountain to thaw it.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nClearing furnace grate.png|Clearing the furnace grate.\nLighting braziers.png|Lighting the braziers.\nMelting ice fountain.png|Melting the fountain.\n</gallery>\n\n===A meeting of rivals===\n[[File:Boneguard (1) chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:Crumbling the Boneguard.png|thumb|Releasing the Boneguard from its prison.]]\nAfter all four globes are lit, speak to Lazim again, who will warn you of traps beyond the barrier, such as giant skeletons that will rend your limbs from your body. Go north through the barrier and up the ladder. You will indeed encounter a [[Boneguard]] south of the ladder. Talk to it. It warns you that you will not pass it unless it 'crumbles to dust' and attack  if you don't run away in time. Cast [[Crumble Undead]] on it. Your spell '''must hit''' the guard. The boneguard collapses and a freed spirit thanks you. It asks you to please bury the five [[big bones]] it has left behind.\n\nPass the boneguard's remains and climb down the ladder. You'll see another boneguard. If you want, you may also climb down the ladder from the other side, where Enakhra herself is standing. She angrily tells you not to interrupt her concentration and fires two spells at the Boneguard opposite her to prevent him from escaping before Zamorak can collect it, his weapon. Speak to the [[Boneguard]]. It will attack you once, stating that someone so easy to hit is not worth its time.\n\nThis time, turn on [[Protect from Melee]] and talk to it. It will try to attack you a couple of times — then, it will be impressed and ask for your help. It will tell you that it was put under [[Enakhra]]'s control millennia ago and that she had tricked him into this state of slavery. When her concentration wavered, the Boneguard managed to construct part of a wall to obscure Enakhra's line of sight, but her spells have strengthened lately. Agree to help the Boneguard by finishing the wall so that it can be free. It promises you its amulet as a reward in return. It tells you to take stones from the nearby pile of rubble, stack them on the unfinished wall, trimming them with a chisel so they fit and that it will require but three loads.\n\nIf you want, you may quiz him for more backstory on himself and Enakhra. He says the latter is a 'coward and a despicable traitor' who supported Zamorak when he became a god. She built him this temple as a gift, but he did not care and she has been hidden inside ever since. He himself was once a proud mage but has long been trapped in Boneguard form, forced to defend Enakhra's temple from intruders when he believed her lies about wanting to become allies and end their rivarly.\n[[File:Wall chiselling.png|Building the wall.|thumb|220px]]\nTake three pieces of [[sandstone]] from the [[rubble (Enakhra's Lament)|pile of bricks]], use the sandstone on the wall and then use your [[chisel]] on the wall to trim it. Once you've built the wall, Enakhra will be furious with you. Optionally, cross to the other side to talk to her. She will say the Boneguard, [[Akthanakos]], is much harder to control now and that he supports [[Zaros|someone]] whose name should not be mentioned. She also scolds you for dishonouring Zamorak's name.\n\nTalk to the boneguard. It will thank you, crumble and reveal itself to be another [[Mahjarrat]], the camel-headed [[Akthanakos]]. He is free from slavery after thousands of years and gives you his amulet in thanks. It allows you to understand [[camel]]s and [[Ugthanki]] as well as containing teleports back to the temple. He then confronts his rival in a cutscene.\n\nEnakhra blows up the wall and faces her nemesis. Akthanakos laughs and says Lord [[Zaros]] will be happy to aid him should, as Enakhra announces, Zamorak come to punish him for destroying his weapon. They transform into their skeleton forms and announce they will fight in [[the North]] before teleporting away.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nDefending against boneguard.png|The boneguard attacks you.\nEnakhra attacks Akthanakos.png|Enakhra focussing her magic on her rival.\nAkthanakos laughing.png|Akthanakos reveals his allegiance.\nAkthanakos and Enakhra to the North.png|The Mahjarrat head to the North.\n</gallery>\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Enakhra's Lament\n|image = [[File:Enakhra's Lament reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Crafting|7,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*{{SCP|Mining|7,000}} [[Mining]] experience\n*{{SCP|Firemaking|7,000}} [[Firemaking]] experience\n*{{SCP|Magic|7,000}} [[Magic]] experience\n*[[Camulet]], which allows you to talk to [[camel]]s and teleport to the temple four times.

Note that secateurs, rakes and spades can also be obtained from a [[Tool Leprechaun]] if placed there before, but as you'll be waiting several hours, it's not practical to bring the tools to the island with you.\n\nThe recommended run is:\n\n* Inventory one: papyrus (3), candle, ball of wool, sack of potatoes, red and yellow dyes, silk (10), empty sack (8), bowl (Obtainable from the house just east of Auguste, up the ladder) \n** If '''planting the tree yourself,''' when given [[Auguste's sapling]], leave with the basket of apples and plant it. Harvest the [[willow branch]]es, and then return to [[Entrana]] with the following items.\n\n* Inventory two: willow branches (12), tinderbox, logs (10). Complete the balloon voyage and quest.\n\nTo start the quest, travel to [[Entrana]] and speak to [[Auguste]], who is on the west side of the island, just north of the [[Frincos's Fabulous Herb Store|Herblore shop]]. Remember that [[weapons]]/[[armour]] are not allowed on the island.\n\n===Test balloons===\n[[Auguste]] wants to make two test balloons and asks the player to get him the following items:\n*3 [[papyrus]] - can be bought from the [[Tai Bwo Wannai]] or [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] shops on [[Karamja]], bought from the [[general store]] in [[Ardougne]], bought from [[Ali Morrisane]], or taken from [[Spawning|respawns]] at the [[Legends' Guild]], [[Yanille]] and [[Hosidius]].\n*A [[candle]] - buy from the [[candle seller]] in Tai Bwo Wannai, Shilo Village, or [[Catherby]], or steal one from a table in Entrana's church, taking a maximum of 2 damage if unsuccessful.\n*A [[ball of wool]] - spin from [[wool]] sheared from a [[sheep]], or buy from Ardougne shop or the [[Lletya]] seamstress.\n*A [[Potatoes|sack of potatoes]] - potatoes can be [[Farming|grown]], bought in the shops on [[Miscellania]] and [[Etceteria]], or gathered from the house east of the quest start (with the flowerbed). Sacks are available from any [[Farming shops|Farming shop]]. Click the sack with 10 potatoes in your [[inventory]] to fill up the sack. There is also a potato patch just east of Auguste. (NOTE: Auguste will not allow you to create origami balloons without first having the sack of potatoes).\n\n[[File:Enlightened Journey balloon test.png|thumb|250px|An angry mob destroys the balloon.]]\nOnce you have the items, Auguste tells you to make a model of an origami balloon. Use papyrus with the ball of wool, creating a balloon structure, and then use an unlit candle on the balloon structure to get an origami balloon. '''Do not light the balloon or else you will have to get the items again!'''\n\nTalk to Auguste to see a short [[cutscene]] of the balloon launch. After that, talk to him again, and he will take the remaining two pieces of papyrus and the sack of potatoes from you. In a second cutscene, the player launches the next balloon, which is attacked by an angry mob of peasants.\n\n===Main balloon===\nNext, [[Auguste]] asks the player to get the materials for a real balloon:\n*[[Yellow dye]] - can be obtained by giving [[Aggie]] in [[Draynor Village]] two [[onion]]s and 5 [[coins]] or can be bought from [[Lletya]] seamstress shop.\n*[[Red dye]] - can be obtained by giving Aggie three [[redberries]] and 5 coins or can be bought from [[Lletya]] seamstress shop.\n*10 [[silk]] - can be bought from the [[silk merchant]] in [[Al Kharid]] at 2-3 coins each, or [[Thieving|stolen]] from the [[Silk stall|stalls]] in [[Ardougne]].\n*A [[bowl]] - can be bought at any [[general store]] or made in [[Barbarian Village]] from [[soft clay]]. There also exists a bowl upstairs in the building directly east of Auguste.\n*8 [[sandbag]]s - Use an [[empty sack]] with a [[sand pit]] (use the one just south of Auguste) to get a sandbag.\n*12 [[willow branch]]es\n\n'''''You can skip the following paragraph if you already have willow branches in your bank. '''''After you bring these items (12 in total) to Auguste, he will need you to attach willow branches to the platform. Auguste will give the player a basket of apples and an \"[[Auguste's sapling]]\", which is actually a [[willow sapling]]. Plant the sapling in any [[tree patch]] and ask the local farmer to look after the growing tree by paying with a [[Apples|basket of apples]]. Once it is fully grown, check its health, wait a half hour, then cut [[willow branch]]es from it by using [[secateurs]] on the tree. You can only get 6 branches at once, so you'll need to wait another half hour to get all 12. To save time, you can buy the willow branches from the [[Grand Exchange]].\n\nGive the dyes, pieces of silk, bowl, and the sandbags to Auguste in the same trip. Teleport to a bank and take out the 12 willow branches, 10 normal logs, and tinderbox. (Note: You can travel to Pest Control via the ships for a quick bank) Head back to Auguste and use the 12 willow branches on the frame of the balloon to weave a basket.\n\n===Fuel===\nTen [[Logs|normal logs]] (other log types '''will not work''') and a [[tinderbox]] are needed for completing the journey. Because [[axe]]s can be wielded as a weapon, they are not allowed on [[Entrana]]. Logs should be prepared ''before'' going to Entrana.\n\n'''Note:''' You can bring noted logs and store them nearby (up to 100). You CAN use logs from the [[log storage]] box for the quest and store them before finishing the quest.\n\n===Ballooning===\nAfter giving the materials to [[Auguste]], weaving the basket and having the [[logs]] and [[tinderbox]] in the [[inventory]], speak to Auguste to get ready to fly. He'll describe some of what the player should notice and some tips on how to fly the balloon.\n\nAn interface to control the balloon will appear. Manoeuvre through the obstacle course without hitting ''anything'' (including birds, trees, houses, and clouds) and safely ''land'' on the well-marked landing spot on the third screen.\n\n====Balloon control panel====\n[[File:Balloon Controls.png|frame|Balloon Controls panel]]\nClicking any control advances the balloon one \"space\" to the right.\n*The top button (drop sandbag) moves the balloon two spaces up ('''UP 2''').\n*The next button (use log) moves the balloon one space up ('''UP 1''').\n*\"Relax\" advances the balloon to the right without changing altitude ('''RIGHT''').\n*The normal rope lowers the balloon by one space ('''DOWN 1'''),\n*The red rope lowers the balloon by two spaces ('''DOWN 2''').\n*Clicking \"Bail\" will cancel the flight.\n\nThe numbers at the side of sack and log buttons correspond to how many times player can use the resources respectively; therefore, fuel is limited. If the player runs out of fuel, they can still \"relax\" or lower altitude (by pulling ropes).\n\nA tip is that ''how'' the balloon appears to travel is not as important as ''where'' it will end up. If the balloon meets a cloud right above it and a bird in front of it, it is possible to go right through both obstacles by dropping sacks or pulling the red rope (raising and dropping the balloon by 2 spaces respectively). The balloon will fly high or low enough to avoid the bird, and will advance one space forward to avoid the cloud. It might not ''seem'' like the balloon can fit through, but it ''can''.\n\n===Flying to Taverley===\nWhen ready to fly, three screens showing the path to [[Taverley]] will appear in the ballooning interface. Go [[Balloon transport system|here]] for more pictures.\n\n'''The balloon should end up one space above the landing pad, with no air space in between'''. Flying past the landing pad would get the balloon blown away, and getting the balloon in the space with the landing pad would cause it to smash to the ground—in both cases, the flight would be considered unsuccessful. The player needs to restart the flight by preparing the [[logs]] and [[tinderbox]] again before going to [[Entrana]], although they don't have to rebuild the balloon.\n\nThere are various ways to control the balloon, and the following is just one of the ''suggested'' paths:\n\n{{:Balloon transport system/Taverley}}\n\nAfter the balloon has landed, talk to [[Auguste]] for a little dialogue - then, the quest is finished.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Enlightened Journey\n|image = [[File:Enlightened Journey reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Crafting|2,000}} [[Crafting]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Farming|3,000}} [[Farming]] experience\n*{{SCP|Woodcutting|1,500}} [[Woodcutting]] experience\n*{{SCP|Firemaking|4,000}} [[Firemaking]] experience\n*The [[Bomber jacket]] and [[Bomber cap|cap]]\n**[[Gnome goggles]] from the [[Gnome Restaurant]] [[Minigames|minigame]] can be combined with the bomber cap by talking with [[Auguste]]\n*Access to the [[balloon transport system]]\n**4 new routes available to be flown, when successfully flown they provide an additional 2,000 Firemaking experience per route.\n*Ability to make [[origami balloon]]s\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Enlightened Journey is required for the following:\n*[[Monkey Madness II]]\n*[[Ardougne Diary|Ardougne Achievement Diary]] (Medium)\n*[[Varrock Diary|Varrock Achievement Diary]] (Medium)\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Three of the four members of the angry mob are named [[Larry (Enlightened Journey)|Larry]], [[Moe]], and [[Curly]], a reference to ''{{wp|The Three Stooges}}''.\n*The mob destroying the balloon in the cutscene may be a reference to an event where angry peasants and farmers destroyed the balloon of Jacques Alexandre César Charles in 1783 when it landed. [[wikipedia:Balloonomania|Balloonomania]] is a term used to describe the actions and interests of the public at the time that lighter than air flight was invented. \n*The player states \"Well, that went down like a lead balloon\". This is a popular saying in the UK which is used when an idea or action goes wrong or is not received well.\n*Auguste bears similarities to {{WP|Jean-Luc Picard}} from ''{{WP|Star Trek: The Next Generation}}''. Auguste asks if you would like to be his \"number one accomplice\", a reference to what Picard calls his first officer William Riker: \"Number One\". The player also asks him if he is going to \"boldly go where no man has gone before\", a line from the intro of the show.\n*Auguste almost mentions tribbles before correcting himself and saying \"trouble\". Tribbles are an alien race in the ''Star Trek'' universe and first appeared in the episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\".\n*The phrase, \"[Player], it has been a privilege flying with you\" is a reference to the 1995 film ''{{WP|Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13}}''.\n*Completion of this quest will cause a [[Crazy penguin|penguin balloonist]] to spawn during and after the quest [[Cold War]]. However, said NPC will not appear if this quest has not been completed prior to the dialogue trigger that checks if the quest was completed and will not appear even if the quest is completed at a later point. The same happens with the quest [[Between a Rock...]]\n\n{{Enlightened Journey}}"

She wants you to find her fiancé, [[Ernest]], who had gone to the manor an hour ago for directions and has not come back yet.\n\nEnter the manor and climb up the staircase in the centre room. Then climb up the spiral stairs immediately west to find [[Professor Oddenstein]]. He will explain that Ernest was turned into a chicken when he was helping on an experiment with his 'pouletmorph' machine. However, to change him back, the professor needs parts that were stolen and hidden by the poltergeists in the manor.\n\nYou need to help him find a [[pressure gauge]], a [[rubber tube]], and an [[oil can]] in any order.\n\n===Pressure gauge===\nTo get the pressure gauge, [[fish food]] and [[poison (item)|poison]] are required. Fish food is in a blue box, one is found on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} in the room directly south of the main staircase. Poison is in a green bottle, one is found on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} in the small north-western room south of the kitchen.\n\nUse the poison on the fish food to create [[poisoned fish food]]. Go to the south-eastern room, '''grab the spade''' next to the door leading outside, if you do not already have one to get the rubber tube. Leave the manor by exiting the door in the south-eastern room, go to the south-western corner of the manor grounds to the fountain. '''Use''' the poisoned fish food on the fountain to kill the piranhas then search the fountain to get the pressure gauge.\n\n===Rubber tube===\n[[File:Ernest the Chicken - Rubber tube.png|thumb|220px|The rubber tube and the skeleton.]]\nOn the west side of the grounds look for a [[compost heap]], north of the [[belladonna]] [[special patch]] near a patch of [[cabbage (Draynor Manor)|cabbage]]s. Search the compost heap, requiring a [[spade]] and you will get a [[Key (Ernest the Chicken)|key]]. Go back into the manor through the front door then go through the door to the room behind the stairs containing the [[aggressive]] [[skeleton]] and take the [[rubber tube]]. The skeleton will attack you, so if you are a low level it is recommended to get the tube and leave as quickly as possible.\n\n===Oil can===\nGo to the western room on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}, search the [[Bookcase (Draynor Manor)|bookcase]] on the western side on the wall to gain access to a secret room. Go down the ladder into the basement where there will be doors and levers around you.

Inspect the [[Empty display (Xerna's Diadem)|empty display]] to start the quest, then speak to [[Curator Herminius]]; fed up with how long the guards are taking, he will take the investigation into his own hands, and ask you to see if there's anything he missed.\n\nInvestigate the set of [[Tools (Ethically Acquired Antiquities)|tools]] on the ground behind the display to find out they are specialist tools, and inspect the display again to observe that the glass was tampered with. Next, talk to the nearby citizens, academics, and tourists around the floor and ask whether they had seen anything suspicious. The person who gives you the information is random for each player, but one will eventually mention a shifty individual skulking around who left through the front door and turned right towards the [[landing site]].\n\nSpeak to [[Regulus Cento]] at the Civitas landing site (not in [[Varrock]]) and ask whether he's seen anybody suspicious around. He'll mention a person carrying a case who wanted to have a go with his bird. However, Regulus refused, and the person went east to the [[Fortis Cothon]] instead. Make sure you have one free inventory space, and then head to the Cothon and talk to any [[Trader Crewmember]]. Ask them about the man with the case, and they will ask for a small favour in exchange for the information. Agree, and they'll give you some [[tattered sails]] which need to be fixed up at [[Artima's Crafting Supplies]].\n\nHead just south of the Cothon, to the shop marked on the map with a [[File:Crafting shop icon.png|frameless]], and speak with [[Artima]]. Tell her you were hoping for some help, and she will ask you for a favour as well; to thank the crew for bringing in her latest shipment. She will then give you the repaired [[Sails (Ethically Acquired Antiquities)|sails]]. Use the sails on any trader crewmember, and they'll tell you a \"grey-haired fella\" came by and asked if he could have a go with their boat. The crew then explained to him how to charter a ship properly, and sailed the man to [[Port Sarim]].\n\n===Theft Across the Sea===\n[[File:Betty chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nMake your way to Port Sarim by any method you wish, such as the charter ship, the [[Rat Pits]] [[grouping]] teleport, or a planted [[spirit tree]]. Once there, head all the way to the southernmost dock and speak any trader crewmember about the grey-haired man. They will tell you that he wandered up north in search of some [[runes]] to get a hold of.\n\nThe nearest rune store is [[Betty's Magic Emporium.|Betty's Magic Emporium]], found in the northwest corner of Port Sarim. With one free inventory space, make your way to the store and ask [[Betty]] about the man. Betty will mention that he wore a monocle, and that he didn't know what he was looking for when he arrived. She'll give you some some [[Betty's notes|notes]] she took while trying to understand him, hoping you'll make sense of them.\n\nBased on the notes, the runes being requested are those for casting [[Varrock Teleport]]. With all this in mind, the man who best fits the description you have been given so far is in fact [[Haig Halen]], the curator of the [[Varrock Museum]]. Make your way there, and tell him that you're looking for Xerna's Diadem; he will immediately act suspicious, claiming that he can't help you. You may now destroy the notes, leaving an open inventory space for the next section of the quest.\n\n===Misunderstanding===\n[[File:Curator Haig Halen chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nPickpocket the curator to receive a [[Storeroom key (Ethically Acquired Antiquities)|storeroom key]], and use it to enter the storeroom to the north-east of the museum (right under the stairs to the second floor). Search the single unstacked crate in the middle of the room to discover that Xerna's Diadem is hidden inside, along with various other artefacts that don't seem to belong there.\n\nReturn to Curator Haig Halen, and speak to him to begin an interrogation in which you press him for answers. A \"Shame-o-meter\" will appear on the screen; you must now select chat options that will shame him. The exact sequence varies for each player, but the most effective options are usually calling him a thief or disparaging his museum as being full of stolen goods. Once the shame meter reaches 100%, Haig will explain what happened.\n\nHaig will claim that, during his visit to the [[Grand Museum]], he saw a [[Thief (Ethically Acquired Antiquities)|thief]] break in and steal Xerna's Diadem. Haig will then claims that he used the combat skills he picked up during his time in the Varrock Guard to subdue the thief. However, stuck on what to do next, Haig explains that he decided to take the artefact back to Varrock Museum for \"safekeeping.\"\n\nThe player offers to omit the details of the theft to the Grand Museum, as long as Haig arranges the safe return of the diadem. After Haig agrees to return it, head back to Civitas illa Fortis and speak with [[Curator Herminius]] at the Grand Museum to complete the quest.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nFile:Museum storeroom.png|The surreptitious storeroom in which Haig hides his haul.\nFile:Ethically Acquired Antiquities - shaming the curator.png|The player presses the curator for answers on the theft of Xerna's Diadem.\nFile:Ethically Acquired Antiquities - curator visits Grand Museum.png|Curator Haig Halen visits the Grand Museum in Fortis.\nFile:Ethically Acquired Antiquities - curator beats up thief.png|The curator beats the thief into submission.\n</gallery>'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Ethically Acquired Antiquities\n|image = [[File:Ethically Acquired Antiquities reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n* {{SCP|Thieving|6,000|link=yes}} experience\n* 5,000 [[coins]]\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The dialogue option \"This is stealing! Thieving! Taking what's not yours!\" when shaming [[Curator Haig Halen]] is a reference to the 1992 infomercial [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up863eQKGUI&t=362s \"Don't Copy That Floppy\"].\n* The dialogue option <nowiki>''</nowiki>You're supposed to protect history, not steal it!<nowiki>''</nowiki> is a reference to <nowiki>''</nowiki>Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith<nowiki>''</nowiki>. \n* The storeroom also contains items from other places, such as a [[Transvergence theory|book]] belonging to the [[Arceuus library]], a [[Broodoo shield]] belonging to [[Tai Bwo Wannai]] and a discarded label belonging to the [[Outpost]].\n** Upon finding the discarded label, it reads, 'Property of the Outpost. Contact Jorral if lost.' However, players who talk to Jorral after the quest will not have the option to talk about the label.\n*The premise of this quest is a reference to the [[wikipedia:British_Museum#Controversies_and_criticism|British Museum contested artefacts]] controversy. The museum is infamous for housing allegedly stolen artefacts from around the world, many of which sit in storage indefinitely.\n\n{{Ethically Acquired Antiquities}}"

The King, unable to trust Glouphrie, banishes him from the [[Gnome Stronghold|Stronghold]], which Glouphrie isn't happy about. Hazelmere will then give you a [[violet pentagon]] for the machine.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nFile:The Eyes of Glouphrie - Hazelmere enters player's mind.png|Hazelmere gets inside your mind.\nFile:The Eyes of Glouphrie - gnome battalion.png|Gnomes and Goblins battle.\nFile:The Eyes of Glouphrie - gnome army council.png|King Healthorg (top), Oaknock (left), Glouphrie (front), and Hazelmere (right) are seen on the battlefield.\nFile:The Eyes of Glouphrie - Glouphrie's grand illusion.png|Glouphrie summons holograph tortoises to fool Goblins.\nFile:The Eyes of Glouphrie - Argento dies.png|Argento is dead!\nFile:The Eyes of Glouphrie - Argento convention.png|Oaknock summons the King and his advisors.\n</gallery>\n\n===Sabotage===\n[[File:The Eyes of Glouphrie - sabotage.png|thumb|left|Someone sneaks in during the conversation with Brimstail...]]\nGo back and speak to [[Brimstail]] where you will see a shorter [[cutscene]] in which an [[Intruder|invisible gnome]] will sabotage the machine you examined earlier.\n\n[[File:The Eyes of Glouphrie - Oaknock's damaged machine.png|thumb|right|You'll need to repair this]]\nCrush your [[mud rune]] with the [[pestle and mortar]], and then use it on the [[bucket of sap]] to create [[magic glue]]. Repair the machine using your [[maple logs]], [[oak logs]] and the glue. You will need to have a [[hammer]] and a [[saw]] in your inventory.\n\nIf you did not bring a [[bucket of sap]] ahead of time, there is a tree just north of Brimstail's cave, between two Oak trees, that you can extract sap from. Use a knife on it with a bucket in your inventory to extract the sap.\n\nNow, you will have to unlock and restart the machine. For this, you will need more crystal discs—talk to Brimstail to get some from him. You can talk to him multiple times to get more shapes. If you can no longer get discs from Brimstail, drop the discs and talk to him again to get more discs. '''Alternatively, you can exchange the discs at the exchanger next to the machine.'''\n\nTo work this machine, you have to fit crystal discs to the numbers shown. The numbers will be different for everybody; therefore, you have to solve this mostly yourself. This is how it works:\n\nTo the west side is a [[Machine panel|chart]] showing the values of each colour.\n\n{{Colour-shape value|align=right}}\nThe crystal is equal to:\n*Red: 1\n*Orange: 2\n*Yellow: 3\n*Green: 4\n*Blue: 5\n*Indigo: 6\n*Violet: 7\n\nThis value is multiplied by the number of sides each crystal has:\n*Circle has 1 side.\n*Triangle has 3 sides.\n*Square has 4 sides.\n*Pentagon has 5 sides.\n\n*Example 1: a 4 can be a red square or a green circle (1 * 4)\n*Example 2: a 7 can only be a violet circle (7 * 1)\n*Example 3: a 12 can be a green triangle or a yellow square (4 * 3)\n\nSome of the colours can be easily mixed up, since they are very similar (e.g. blue, indigo and violet). Hover them with your mouse to be sure.\n\nThe yellow circle can '''never''' be obtained. If the puzzle requires a value of three, you must use the red triangle instead. Brimstail cannot directly give you any circles, or red coloured shapes. If you need the lower value shapes the exchanger must be used.\n\nThere is a token exchanger on the right-hand side, which allows you to insert various tokens and change them for others of the same value. <u>You cannot exchange more than 35 points worth at a time</u>, but you may exchange a single token for many other lower valued tokens if its value is high enough. You will always receive the same value back, in different tokens. For example, if you need an indigo pentagon (30), and have a violet pentagon (35). Put the violet pentagon into the exchanger, and keep declining the transaction until the machine offers you an indigo pentagon (30) and a red pentagon (5).\n\n[[File:The Eyes of Glouphrie - token exchanger interface.png|thumb|right|Token exchanger]]\n\nTo ''unlock'' the machine, you have to create a single disc worth the number of points shown on [[Oaknock the Engineer|Oaknock's]] machine. The numbers are different for everyone. As a general strategy, try and get the smaller numbers and it's easier. Any violet pentagons or similar if not needed may be exchanged for ones of a lower value using the Oaknock's exchanger.\n\nOnce unlocked, you need to ''restart'' the machine. For this, you will need to fit '''six''' separate tokens to three different numbers (1 for the first number, 2 for the second and 3 for the third). Be patient—it can take a while to get all the tokens that you need. '''You may speak to Brimstail to get more tokens which may make getting the ones you want easier; it is possible to solve the puzzle by continuously asking for and dropping coins until you get the ones you need.'''\n\n[[File:The Eyes of Glouphrie - solved puzzle.png|140px|left|Successfully restarting the machine]]\nAn example of a completed machine. '''Note: You must fill all slots to unlock the machine!''' In this example, using two violet triangles turned the light green, but still did not work. If this happens, you can just use the exchanger to turn it into two pieces, since the total points stay the same.\n\n===Assassination===\nOnce you have unlocked the machine, speak to [[Brimstail]] again. The once [[cute creature]]s are revealed to be [[evil creature]]s. After the cut-scene, talk to Brimstail and he will tell you to speak to [[King Narnode]].\n[[File:The Eyes of Glouphrie - Izzie's true appearance.png|thumb|Brimstail, shocked by Izzie's true appearance!]]\n\nThere are six creatures in total, and they have 1 [[Hitpoint]] each.\n{{checklist|\n* 1 - One by Brimstail (he may kill it for you).\n* 2 - One by [[King Narnode]]. (You may need to [[Ranged|range]] or [[mage]] this one, as it can get stuck behind the trapdoor.)\n* 3 - One at the top of the [[Grand Tree]], by the prison. (Do not climb down the ladders immediately after killing the creature—it will not count as a kill.)\n* 4 - One by the giant [[tortoise]]s in the pen north-west of the [[Grand Tree]] (north of the toad swamp).\n* 5 - One by the Gnome Stronghold [[Spirit Tree]].\n* 6 - One by the entrance to the [[Gnome Stronghold]]. Go south from the Grand Tree, down the ramp and keep walking to the main entrance of the Stronghold.\n}}\n'''Note:''' If Brimstail kills the evil creature, or if you mess up a creature kill count at any time, the last [[Evil creature|Evil Creature]] will spawn at the entrance to [[Tree Gnome Stronghold|Gnome Stronghold]].\n\nTalk to King Narnode, and he will reward you.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Eyes of Glouphrie\n|image = [[File:The Eyes of Glouphrie reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Magic|12,000}} [[Magic]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Woodcutting|2,500}} [[Woodcutting]] experience\n*{{SCP|Runecraft|6,000}} [[Runecraft]] experience\n*{{SCP|Construction|250}} [[Construction]] experience\n*A [[crystal saw seed]] — Either take it to [[Ilfeen]] in [[Tirannwn]] or use it on the singing bowl by [[Brimstail]] to get an enchanted [[crystal saw]].

They all suspect a different reason (lack of rain, swarms of insects, adventurers digging up the patches, the seasons being off their usual times) for it, though. However, the last gardener you ask will have more interesting explanation, suggesting the fairies might have something to do with it. Speak to [[Martin the Master Gardener|Martin]] again, to whom you suggest the last gardener might have the most accurate reasoning.\n\nTravel to the fairy city of [[Zanaris]]. You'll have to enter the city via the shack in the middle of the [[Lumbridge Swamp]], while having a [[Dramen staff]] equipped, similar to how you entered the city during the [[Lost City]] quest.\n\n===Trouble in Zanaris===\n{{Needed|[[Dramen staff]].|recommended=}}\n[[File:Fairytale I - Growing Pains - Fairy Nuff's grotto.png|thumb|Fairy Nuff's room just north of the bank.]]\n[[File:Fairy Godfather chathead.png|left]]\nHead to the [[Fairy Queen]]'s throne room, just south of where you enter the city.

You can fast travel to him with a [[skills necklace]] (to the Crafting Guild).\n\nHe'll tell you he could probably help, but wants something from you first. He wants a [[Draynor skull|skull]] from a grave in the [[Draynor Manor]] backyard. Head to the back of the manor and dig up the grave there.

From the entrance to the city, travel south-west, past the [[agility shortcuts]], to the mysterious ruins of the [[Cosmic Altar]]. There is a gap on the west side of the room that you can climb through. The [[Gatekeeper]] there will let you pass. Inside the tunnel are a few [[baby tanglefoot|baby tanglefeet]] (level 45). Proceed to the end of the tunnel to stumble upon the level 111 [[Tanglefoot]].\n\nThis creature is unique in that it can only be damaged with the magic secateurs. Furthermore, the maximum damage you can do on the Tanglefoot depends on both your [[Strength]] and [[Farming]] levels. [[Protect from Melee]] is highly recommended for the fight. The Tanglefoot can be [[Flinching|flinched]]. It may be wise to ensure you have extra dramen staves in your bank in case you die and need to get back to your gravestone.\n\nOnce you have defeated the Tanglefoot, make sure to grab the [[Queen's secateurs]] when it drops, before leaving the tunnel.

He states that it never rains on the allotments and that's why people have to keep watering them.\n*Upon hearing the fifth theory, which pertains to fairies, the player character becomes incredulous to the idea that fairies are not only causing the problem, but also that they even exist, despite the fact that completing [[Lost City]] is a prerequisite to even begin this quest.\n**It is possible to ask a Tool Leprechaun about finding a fairy. However, they will direct you to Draynor Village to find Shamus instead. This can be done even before talking to the fifth gardener.\n*The third master gardener that is spoken to during the investigation will theorise that the reason for the bad crops is due to all the adventurers repeatedly digging up and replanting the crops, thereby ruining the soil.\n**When they ask the player about having a \"secret guild\" they use to annoy the gardeners, the player brings up the [[Heroes' Guild]]. The gardener takes this as a confession and tells the player to be ashamed of themselves.\n*Attempting to talk to other gardeners after the fifth theory will have them reply with \"I don't think the crops ARE failing, now leave me alone, I have work to do.\"\n\n{{Fairytale I - Growing Pains}}"

He will tell you to come back once his crops are grown, so wait until your quest menu says his crops have had plenty of time to grow; this takes approximately five and a half minutes of logged in time.\n\nTalk to him again. He informs you rather crossly that there is still something wrong with the crops, not believing your story about fairies and accusing you of creating this problem. Agree to investigate for him.\n\n===Surprise!===\n[[File:Fairy Nuff's grotto ransacked.png|thumb|left|200px|Fairy Nuff's grotto, ransacked]]\n{{Map|mapID=28|group=1|y:4472,x:2387|mtype=square|r=4|height=250|width=250|align=right|caption=Fairy Nuff's grotto location.}}\n[[File:Nuff's certificate strange symbols.png|thumb|220px|Strange fairy symbols found on the back of Fairy Nuff's certificate.The certificate reads: \"The Godfather attacked us.

Equip a Dramen or Lunar staff and go into [[Zanaris]], and head toward [[Fairy Nuff]]'s grotto, just north of the bank. Walk in, and you'll see a short cutscene. On the ground and next to one of the potion shelves is Fairy [[Nuff's certificate]]; pick it up. Right click and choose \"Study\". Studying the certificate reveals its back, which is covered with [[Lunar alphabet|strange fairy symbols]].\n[[File:Cosmic Rune Altar Sign.png|thumb|220px|The sign reads: \"Cosmic Rune Altar\" and is on the south wall.]]\nTalk to the [[Fairy chef]], south of the bank. She will tell you that she's seen similar inscriptions on a [[Rune temple sign|sign]] near the mysterious ruins — the [[Cosmic Altar]] ruins in southern Zanaris, next to the [[tanglefoot]] area. The inscriptions are south of the altar on the wall between two trees.\n\n'''You must look at the sign and study the certificate.'''\n\nThe symbols say \"Cosmic Rune Altar.\" If you were to translate it, the back of the certificate reads:\n\n{{cquote2|''The Godfather attacked us.

Ask him what happened to the Queen, to which he visibly starts panicking and rushes to say that he will create a search party for her. Ask him both questions, and then agree to return to him once you've found the queen. The Godfather gives you permission to use the [[fairy rings]] to locate the queen. He asks you to speak to the [[Co-ordinator]] outside the room to learn more about the rings.\n\nAfter talking to the Co-ordinator and being informed of the vast history of the fairy rings and the queen, head south-west to the [[File:Water source icon.png]] fountains. Talk to [[Fairy Fixit]] near the fairy ring, south of the fountains. After that, use the fairy rings while wielding a [[Dramen staff]] (or a [[Lunar staff]] if you have partially or fully completed [[Lunar Diplomacy]]).\n:'''''{{Colour|#C04040|You may now use the [[fairy rings]] throughout Gielinor without finishing the quest, if you'd prefer.}}'''''\n:''See the '''[[fairy rings]]''' guide for all the possible combinations.''\n\n===Regrouping===\nWith [[Nuff's certificate]] in your inventory, use the [[fairy ring]] four times in sequence. '''You will need to repeat this sequence each time you wish to visit the Fairy Queen's hideout.''' Once you have correctly done it once, the sequence of four appears as an option at the bottom of the teleports list. After the quest you will no longer need Nuff's certificate, but you will still need to do all four teleports. Nuff's certificate in your inventory '''must''' be obtained '''after''' you meet the required skill levels to complete the quest.\n#{{fairycode|AIR}} (Islands: South of [[Witchaven]])\n#{{fairycode|DLR}} (Islands: [[Poison Waste]] south of [[Isafdar]])\n#{{fairycode|DJQ}} (un-attached code, will not teleport you anywhere)\n#{{fairycode|AJS}} (Islands: [[Penguin]]s near [[Miscellania]], or [[Fairy Queen|Queen]]'s location)\n\n'''If you end up on an island with some penguins''', you do not have Nuff's certificate in your inventory. You may also have skipped deciphering the certificate's message or simply missed one code in the sequence. (If you get the message \"Maybe you need to investigate further first..\", this indicates you correctly input the fairy ring sequence but may have skipped the sign at the Cosmic Altar.)\n\n[[File:Fairytale II - The dying Fairy Queen.png|thumb|220px|The Fairy Queen, on her bed, dying.]]\nYou should be in the [[Fairy Queen]]'s [[Fairy Resistance Hideout|new location]]. Just go up the path, and head to the north-eastern room. Talk to [[Fairy Nuff]] and to [[Fairy Very Wise]], who will inform you that the queen is not well because the [[Godfather]] has hurt her by not returning her [[magic secateurs]]. As her essence is drained, she cannot retaliate without obtaining the secateurs, which you accept to bring back.\n\nHead back to Zanaris, and pickpocket the [[Fairy Godfather]]. This requires level 40 [[Thieving]] to be completed successfully. If you fail, you will be teleported outside Zanaris. A quick way to get back to Zanaris is the [[Salve graveyard teleport]] which will place you a few strides away from the [[Canifis]] fairy ring.\n\nTry pickpocketing from behind or the side, and make sure neither of his henchmen are looking directly at you. You should get a golden [[Queen's secateurs]]. Also, at this point, you will see [[ork]]s patrolling Zanaris.\n\nReturn to the Fairy Queen's Hideout by using the same four-ring sequence listed above. \n\n:{{Colour|red|Warning:}} If you prepared the ingredients in advance, make sure you give the secateurs to Fairy Nuff before mixing the [[magic essence]]/crushing the gorak claw, or you'll have to get the ingredients all over again!\n\n===Magic essence===\nBack at the fairy hideout, talk to [[Fairy Nuff]], and give her the [[Queen's secateurs|secateurs]]. She will use them to rejuvenate the queen, but they do not work completely. Nuff tells you that she needs a certain [[magic essence]] potion to replenish the queen's missing life energy. To make the potion, you need to collect some [[Star flower]]s and [[gorak claw powder]].\n\n====Star flower====\n[[File:Starflowers growing.png|thumb|220px|Starflowers]]\n{{Needed|[[Dramen staff]] or [[Lunar staff]]}}\n\nReturn to the [[fairy ring]] and use the code {{fairycode|CKP}}, which transports you to a [[Cosmic entity's plane|cosmic plane]]. Move around for about two minutes whilst the [[Star flower]]s grow. You can pass the time by talking to the [[Cosmic Being]] who lives there, contemplating the mysteries of the universe.\n\nPick a star flower when ready (49 [[Farming]] needed), and add your harvest to the [[vial of water]] (57 [[Herblore]] needed—however, if you are [[boost]]ing, wait until you have the [[gorak claw powder]] because you need 57 Herblore to finish the potion).\n\n====Gorak claws====\n{{Needed|Dramen or Lunar staff, Nuff's certificate|recommended=Armour, weapons, food and restore potions to kill [[Gorak]]s}}\n\nReturn to [[Zanaris]], and withdraw any [[armour]] and [[weapons]], along with around 10 pieces of good [[food]]. Goraks are '''very''' accurate, so take the best [[Armour/Melee armour|melee armour]] you have. They are aggressive, but luckily, they are not located in a [[multicombat area]], therefore you can only fight one at time. However, by remaining in the fairy ring, they will not be aggressive until they are attacked.[[File:Gorak safespot (1).png|thumb|212x212px|A player safespotting the goraks]]\n'''Tips:'''\n:* [[Gorak]]s use typeless melee attacks, meaning [[Protection prayers]] do not have any effect. However, you may use boosting prayers such as [[Piety]].\n:* The accuracy of the goraks' attacks is calculated by your '''crush''' defence, so it is recommended to wear crush-resistant armour such as chainmail.\n:* It is possible to safespot the goraks (see picture). However, their aggression and high max hit may render this difficult, so be extra careful if you are low levelled.\n\nAt the Zanaris [[fairy ring]], use the sequence {{fairycode|DIR}} to get to another plane full of goraks. They are level 145 or 149 and occasionally drain stat points. Kill them, eating food when necessary and drink [[restore potion]]s if needed until you get a [[Gorak claws|gorak claw]]. To leave, equip your staff of choice and teleport to Zanaris using the right-click option on the fairy ring.\n\n===The final scene===\n{{Needed|Dramen or Lunar staff, Nuff's certificate, star flower, gorak claw, pestle and mortar, vial of water}}\n\nNote: Ensure you have retrieved the Queen's secateurs at this point, otherwise a dose of the magic essence potion will be lost and the queen will not regain consciousness.\n\nCrush the claw with a [[pestle and mortar]] to get [[gorak claw powder]]. Mix the [[star flower]] and [[gorak claw powder]] into a [[vial of water]] to make a [[magic essence]] potion (57 [[Herblore]] needed). Return to the [[Fairy Resistance Hideout|Resistance Hideout]], use a dose of the magic essence potion on the [[Fairy Queen|queen]], who finally regains her senses.\n[[File:Curing Fairy Queen.gif|frame|The player uses the magic essence on the Queen, saving her life!]]\nAs the queen angrily prepares to return to [[Zanaris]] and take back her throne, [[Fairy Very Wise]] and [[Fairy Nuff]] remind her that the [[Fairy Godfather]] has thugs and [[ork]]s at his disposal. His \"army\" has her easily outclassed, compared to her Majesty's small band of loyalists (many of whom are injured). The queen realises the flaw in the plan, and accepts the advice and allows the Fairy Godfather to remain Zanaris' ruler for the time being.\n\n'''Congratulations!

When you talk to her after finishing the box, the original quest dialogue starts back up.\n*Despite being unattackable, cosmic beings technically have an internal drop table. This drop table is mainly composed of secondary ingredients for potions made using [[Herblore]] and a non-standard herb drop table that included [[grimy torstol]], [[grimy snapdragon|snapdragon]], [[grimy toadflax|toadflax]] and [[grimy rogue's purse|rogue's purse]].\n\n{{Fairytale II - Cure a Queen}}"

He'll tell you about how without his family's crest, he can't prove his heritage and take back his estate. His sons took the crest when they left, and he doesn't know where they all are, though last he heard, [[Caleb]] was working as a chef in [[Catherby]].\n\n===Caleb===\n{{Needed|[[Shrimps]], [[bass]], [[salmon]], [[tuna]] and a [[swordfish]] (all cooked).}}\n\nHead to [[Catherby]]. Near the middle of town (south of the [[Farming shop]]), usually inside the building with the sink, though he wanders outside sometimes, is [[Caleb]]. Talk to him, and he'll say his brothers and he accidentally broke the crest into three [[Crest part|parts]] and each of them ended up with a piece. Luckily, he still has his piece, though he's not going to just hand it over to any passing stranger. He has an important event coming up, and he needs some fish for a special salad. Get them for him, and he'll give you the piece of the crest. What you need is [[shrimp]], [[salmon]], [[tuna]], [[bass]], and [[swordfish]] all cooked. All but the salmon can be fished right there in Catherby. The salmon can be caught in a lake just a little north of the bank in the nearby town of [[Seers' Village]]. Once you have all of that, give it to him and he'll give you the piece as promised, along with a little bit of info. He'll say that [[Avan]] is somewhere in the desert (i.e. in [[Al Kharid]]).\n:'''Important:''' Make sure he tells you about the other missing pieces. If he doesn't, the gem trader will not have the right dialogue options, and you will have to talk to Caleb once again. It is necessary to talk to Caleb again immediately after receiving the piece of the crest to ask him where the other pieces are. Check the quest guide to make sure he's told you about Avan's location before proceeding.\n:'''Note:''' Low level [[Ironman]] accounts without access to the [[Warriors' Guild]] could get 46 [[Fishing]] in order to catch a [[raw bass]] and 43 [[Cooking]] to cook it, or obtain it as a monster drop. They could also acquire cooked [[bass]] and cooked [[tuna]] by catching [[Gourmet impling]]s with 28 [[Hunter]]. Alternatively, all of the fish except for the salmon can be purchased from [[Frankie's Fishing Emporium]] in [[Port Piscarilius]].\n\n===Avan===\n{{Needed|[[necklace mould]], [[ring mould]], any [[pickaxe]], 2 [[Ruby|cut rubies]], [[food]] (optional), [[armour]] (optional), a method to get to [[Falador]] and [[Ardougne]] (optional but will save running) and a Mining boost (if boosting).}}\n\nWhen you talk to the [[gem trader]] in [[Al Kharid]], he will remember the person you're looking for, direct you north towards the [[gold rocks]] in a pit in the desert. Head there and talk to the man wandering around just at the entrance to the pit with a yellow [[cape]] on. This is, indeed, [[Avan]], as he'll tell you when you ask him. He's not giving up his piece of the crest though unless you can help him win the affection of a certain lady by getting him a [['perfect' ring|ring]] and [['perfect' necklace|necklace]] made out of perfect gold. Unfortunately, the stuff there in the desert isn't nearly good enough. He'll tell you a [[dwarf]] named [[Boot]] might know something about where to find the gold.\n\n'''Note:''' It is possible to mine and smith perfect jewellery without speaking to Boot; however, the player must speak to Boot to be able to give the jewellery to Avan.\n{{Map|mapID=6|2984,9810|width=250|height=250|align=right|r=6|mtype=square|caption=[[Boot]] is located towards the far west end of [[Dwarven Mine]].}}\nMake your way to [[Falador]] (alternatively, use a [[combat bracelet]] to teleport to the [[Edgeville Monastery]], or a [[skills necklace]] to the [[Mining Guild]]) and go into [[Dwarven Mines]]. Once inside, go south-west (from the northern entrance) — see the map to the right. Boot should be wandering around down there, in the second alcove. Talk to him and ask him about perfect gold. He'll come up with a likely location. It's a small [[Witchaven Shrine|dungeon]] just between [[Ardougne]] and [[Witchaven]]. You've already been there if you've done the [[Slug Menace]] quest.\n\nTeleport or run to Ardougne. Run east of Ardougne, just outside of the wall next to Witchaven. Make sure to get your [[pickaxe]], food and some gear, as there are a bunch of level 28 [[hobgoblin]]s, level 53 [[ogre]]s, and level 122 [[hellhound]]s that you'll have to either fight or avoid. It is possible to mine the [['perfect' gold ore]]s without combat; however, you will probably be attacked. [[Protect from Melee]] will negate all damage, as the monsters only use melee.\n\nInside the cave, to the east will be a small caged area with several hellhounds inside, along with the gold rocks you need to mine. To the north and south are two rooms with [[lever (Family Crest)|lever]]s in and outside of them. You'll have to do a little bit of a lever puzzle here to open the gate to the hellhounds. (If you have to return later on, you will not need to go through these steps to unlock the door again.)\n[[File:Family Crest - Witchaven Dungeon levers.png|thumb|The sequence of operating the levers to get perfect gold.]]\n\n#Go to the northern wall and pull the lever up.\n#Head into the southern room and pull the lever up.\n#Go back to the northern wall and pull the lever down.\n#Go inside the northern room and pull the lever up.\n#Leave the room and pull the lever on the northern wall up.\n#Go back to the southern room and pull the lever down.\n#The hellhound room should now be unlocked.\n#Mine at least two [['perfect' gold ore]] and get out. Level 122 Hellhound near first rock on the right can be safespotted by hugging wall on your way in then attacking from behind stalagmite, then just mine that rock twice (If boosting and using this method, bring multiple boosts as the ore can take a while to respawn).\n\nNow, get your [[rubies]], your [[ring mould]], and your [[necklace mould]] and go to any [[furnace]] that's handy (perhaps using an amulet of glory to get to the one in [[Al Kharid]]). Smelt the ore into [['perfect' gold bar]]s and then, '''ensuring you have selected \"Make 1\"''' (as you may end up making all of your gold bars into a ring or necklace, which would require you to return to mine more ore), use the resulting 'perfect' bars on the furnace again, selecting the usual ruby ring and ruby necklace options to make the [['perfect' ring]] and [['perfect' necklace]] (if you just make gold jewellery, they will not be 'perfect'). Once you have the items, head back to Al Kharid and give them to Avan. As a reward, he'll give you the second piece of the crest and will tell you how to find his brother.\n\n===Johnathon===\n{{Needed|An [[antipoison]] potion, [[runes]] and [[Wizard's mind bomb]]/[[magic potion]] (if boosting). Combat equipment for the battle with [[Chronozon]].|recommended=An [[amulet of glory]] for quick access to the [[Edgeville Dungeon]] from [[Jolly Boar Inn]].}}\n[[File:Edgeville Dungeon map.png|thumb|upright|Edgeville Dungeon]]\nThe last brother is holed up on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the Jolly Boar Inn north-east of [[Varrock]] near the edge of the [[Wilderness]]. Bring your [[Antipoison|antipoison potion]], and head up to the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} where he is huddled in a room. Talk to him; he'll tell you he got bitten by a [[Poison spider|poisonous spider]]. Give him the antipoison (he'll take the entire potion, not one dose) and he'll be very grateful and be able to relay to you what happened. Apparently, he got cocky and decided he wanted to try to kill a powerful demon named [[Chronozon]]. The demon sent him away and in the process stole the last piece of the crest. If you want it back, you'll have to finish what [[Johnathon]] started.\n:'''{{Colour|red|Warning}}:''' You will be heading into the [[Wilderness]]. The [[chaos druids]] are a popular [[player killing]] spot.\n[[File:Chronozon safespot.png|thumb|Chronozon safespot.]]\n[[Chronozon]] can be found near the poison spiders, near the [[Earth obelisk]] in the [[Edgeville Dungeon]].\n\nYou'll need to bring food, armour, an antipoison potion for the poison spiders, and enough [[runes]] to cast each [[Blast spells|elemental blast spell]] at least once. It will probably take more than one casting, especially if you're lower level, because if the spell just \"splashes\" on Chronozon, it doesn't count. You have to actually ''hit'' Chronozon with a [[Wind Blast]], [[Water Blast]], [[Earth Blast]], and [[Fire Blast]]. When you hit him with all of those spells, it will weaken him and make him a little easier. Afterwards, he may be killed with any [[combat class]].\n\n:'''Note:''' When a cast of [[Wind Blast]], [[Water Blast]], [[Earth Blast]], and [[Fire Blast]] is successful in weakening [[Chronozon]], text will appear in the chatbox stating \"''Chronozon weakens....''\".\n\nIf you don't get all of the spells to successfully hit, though, he '''won't''' die. Also if you take too long to kill him his weakness will wear off and you'll have to weaken him again. Also, if you you are using a combination defence/autocast, he will regenerate, even if all four spells hit. Use the spellbook and cast them just one at a time. When you finally do kill him, grab the crest piece and head out of there. It is also wise to take a one-click teleport, such as the [[Varrock teleport|Varrock teletab]], to teleport out of the dungeon immediately following Chronozon's defeat.\n\n===The crest reassembled===\nNow that you have all three crest pieces, put them together to make the [[family crest (item)|Family Crest]] and then make your way back to [[Varrock]]. Give the crest to [[Dimintheis]] who will be very, very pleased to have it back.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\nAfter completing the quest, it is recommended to talk to Dimintheis to start the [[Family Pest]] miniquest. When you go to one of the brothers to imbue the gauntlets, you'll have the chat option that completes 1/4th of the miniquest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Family Crest\n|image = [[File:Family Crest reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = *[[Steel gauntlets]]\n**The steel gauntlets offer useful perks. Each brother will imbue them with a special ability. They will initially do this for free. Be careful choosing, though, since you can only have one effect, and it will cost you 25,000 [[coins]] to change them. [[Dimintheis]] will provide you with a \"magically\" found pair should you lose them.\n::'''Note: '''Although they are called \"steel\", players with 1 [[Defence]] can wear them.\n}} \n*[[Cooking gauntlets]] ('''[[Caleb]]'''): Reduces the chance of burning certain fish significantly: ([[Raw lobster|lobsters]], [[Raw swordfish|swordfish]], [[Raw monkfish|monkfish]], [[Raw shark|sharks]] and [[Raw anglerfish|anglerfish]].)\n*[[Goldsmith gauntlets]] ('''[[Avan]]'''): Increases the [[Smithing]] [[experience]] from smelting gold by 150%, for a total of 250% - from 22.5 to 56.2.\n*[[Chaos gauntlets]] ('''[[Johnathon]]'''): Increases the damage done by bolt ([[chaos rune]]) spells by 3. Stacks multiplicatively with the [[Tome of Fire]] and [[Slayer helmet (i)]], the former having a moderate upkeep cost, for a maximum hit of 25, which is by far the highest damage per second for a beginner.\n**After the [[Family Pest]] miniquest, you can own unlimited copies of all three gauntlets for a one-off payment of 500,000 coins.\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Chronozon]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Family Crest is required for the following:\n* [[Family Pest]]\n* [[Defender of Varrock]]\n* [[Legends' Quest]]\n* [[Elite Kandarin Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n{{Family Crest}}"

You will enthusiastically ask if he has any more quests for you. After saying that he \"couldn't possibly trouble you further\", and that he is content with life, select the option ''Oh come on, however menial, I want to help!'' He will tell you although he doesn't have anything for you to do, his sons may.\n\nYou may visit his sons in any order.\n\n===Avan===\n[[File:Avan chathead.png|left]]\n[[Avan]] is located in the [[Al Kharid mine]], north of [[Al Kharid]]. He can be reached quickly by teleporting to the [[Emir's Arena]] via [[ring of dueling]], then running north-west.\n\nSpeak to Avan. You will ask if he needs help with anything, as you've had \"a bit of spare time lately\". He will say that everything is fantastic and thanks you for the perfect jewellery you obtained for him during [[Family Crest]]. You will then say that you have a LOT of spare time, and will help out with anything he can think of, but he refuses again.\n\n===Caleb===\n[[File:Caleb chathead.png|left]]\n[[Caleb]] is located in [[Catherby]], in the building north-east of the bank. He can be quickly reached with a [[Catherby Teleport]] if players have access to the [[lunar spellbook]]. Otherwise, players can use [[Camelot teleport]] and run south-east, or south-west from the white wolf mountain gnome glider.\n\nSpeak to Caleb. You will say that you are ready to help with whatever he needs (again). You will daydream about what the family will reward you with, only catching the last bit of what he says, which is investigating a broken lamping stick. You will then ask for him to repeat his problem, as your mind was elsewhere, but this frustrates him and he asks you not to worry about it.\n\n===Johnathon===\n[[File:Johnathon chathead.png|left]]\n[[Johnathon]] is located upstairs in the [[Jolly Boar Inn]], north-east of [[Varrock]]. He can be quickly reached by using a [[Lumberyard teleport]] or [[Digsite pendant|Digsite Pendant]], and running north-west.\n\nHe will excitedly ask for more help, in which he mentions a woman he loves is trapped in a tall tower, surrounded by a flying dragon. Ready to jump into action, you ask the location of the tower. It turns out, unfortunately, that he was joking.\n\n===Finishing up===\nAs the sweet smell of great rewards fades almost completely, head back to [[Dimintheis]], who is happy to hear that his sons are doing well.\n\nAs you are about to leave, disappointed in the lack of help the family needs, Dimintheis suddenly remembers that he does indeed have something you can help him with: 500,000 coins. As they are supposedly a rich family, you ask him why he would need an exorbitant amount of money.\n\nHe will tell you that his family only pretends to be rich, and that they gave themselves a fancy surname. In addition, the gauntlets are not a family heirloom and that he asked the player to recover the family crest to appear wealthy.\n\nGive him 500,000 coins. Miniquest complete!\n\n==Reward==\n*Ability to own all three [[steel gauntlets]] ([[Chaos gauntlets|chaos]], [[Cooking gauntlets|cooking]], and [[Goldsmith gauntlets|goldsmith]]) simultaneously. Speak to any of the brothers to receive one free of charge. You can obtain multiple of each gauntlet. Speak to Dimintheis to receive the base steel gauntlets free of charge, you can obtain multiple copies of these as well.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|miniquest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Speaking to Dimintheis after completing the miniquest reveals that he has many steel gauntlets in his basement, despite no noticeable sign that a basement exists under his house.\n*Johnathon's joke about a lady trapped at the top of a large tower defended by a dragon is a reference of the trope of {{WP|Princess and dragon}}, similar to ''{{WP|Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty}}''.\n*Despite not being a differentiation from any known quest in ''RuneScape'', there are two key differences between Dimintheis, his sons and their nobility status that is noted from this miniquest:\n**In ''Old School RuneScape'', Dimintheis tells you that his family are only pretending to be nobles, that the gauntlets aren't actually a family heirloom, and requesting the crest to be returned was just an act to appear wealthy. In ''RuneScape'', Dimintheis' nobility is genuine and plays a role in the {{RSL|Defender of Varrock}} quest. Due to him being a descendant of one of the {{RSL|Elders of Avarrocka}}, he is capable of using the powers stored within the {{RSL|Restored shield|Shield of Arrav}}, allowing him to save Varrock from the zombie invasion at the end of the quest. This was made part of ''Old School RuneScape''{{'}}s lore when [[Defender of Varrock]] was added to the game in 2024, revealing Dimintheis' heritage is genuine.\n**His sons in ''RuneScape'' can each give you the enchanted versions of the gauntlets for 1,000,000 coins after completing only Family Crest without having to do a mini-quest.\n\n{{Miniquests}}"

Optionally, if you do not have the recommended [[waterskin]]s and [[desert clothing]], you can buy them here.\n\nGo to the little village of Pollnivneach, which is south-east of [[Shantay Pass]]. 200 [[coins]] will get you there on the [[magic carpet]].\n:'''Note:''' If you see the huge wall, you must go '''east''' to enter the village.\n\n===Starting in Pollnivneach===\n[[File:The Asp & Snake Bar..png|thumb|right|The Asp & Snake Bar]]\nHead to the south-eastern corner of the village, head into the [[The Asp & Snake Bar.|bar]], buy 3 [[beer]]s from [[Ali the Barman]] if it wasn't done before, and then talk to [[Drunken Ali]].

Ask to buy two camels. Offer Ali 500 or 1000 [[coins]] (you will actually pay 1000 coins if you offer that and there is no benefit for paying extra, so offering 500 is suggested).

Go and talk to [[Ali the Operator]]. He is located by the purple tent south-west of Pollnivneach and looks like a Menaphite Thug but wielding a [[scimitar]] instead. Ask him if you can join his gang.

You must approach the villager from behind, but if it doesn't work you don't lose your payment, and can just talk to urchin again.\n*'''3rd villager''' – Go back and get the [[blackjack]] from Ali the Operator by asking him for help. Equip the blackjack. Then lure a villager (into a secluded area in an empty building), knock them out with the blackjack, and finally pick their pocket (all options are right click).\n\n===The second job===\nNow, [[Ali the Operator]] wants you to steal the mayor's wife's [[jewels]] from the safe in their villa. Ali the Operator will give you [[keys]] to the front door. Use the [[fake beard]] with the [[Kharidian headpiece]] you got from [[Ali Morrisane]], or buy the two pieces from the [[general store]] in [[Pollnivneach]], to make a [[desert disguise]]. Put on your [[gloves]] and your disguise. Click '''Hide behind''' on the huge [[Cactus (The Feud)|cactus]] just outside the mayor's villa (north-east of the bar). When the dialogue appears and tells you that it is safe to go in since nobody is home, use your key on the door and go in.\n\nSearch the study desk for a note.  If that does not work, try searching the bed upstairs. There is a riddle written on it which grants you the combination to the safe. For a clue to solve the riddle, go upstairs and search the bed for a note which gives the first 5 numbers of the [[wikipedia:Fibonacci_sequence|Fibonacci sequence]] - \"1, 1, 2, 3, 5...\".\n\n[[File:The Feud - cracking the safe.png|thumb|220px|Cracking the safe.]]\nThen, search the landscape picture hanging beside the bed (on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}}, immediately north of the bed) and you discover the safe. The numbers progress from 1-9 (clockwise), and you must click '''1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8''', on the dial. Once the combination is entered, the safe will open and you can take the jewels.\n\n:'''Note:''' If you do not have at least one [[inventory]] space open, you will have to enter this sequence again.\n\n===The third job===\n[[File:The Feud - Ali the Hag.png|thumb|220px|Talking to the [[Ali the Hag|Hag]].]]\nGive the [[jewels]] to [[Ali the Operator]], and he requests you find the traitor. Talk to a [[Menaphite Thug]] gang member about it, and he says, ''\"It must be Traitorous Ali.\"'' Go back to the Ali the Operator, and you're asked to kill him. Now, go talk to [[Ali the Barman]] to find out that the beer on the table belongs to the traitor. Go talk to [[Ali the Hag]] up the hill to the west of the town, and she will make a poison for you if you get her a [[snake]].\n\n[[File:The Feud - snake charming.png|thumb|left|220px|Charming the [[snake]].]]\nNow, go around the back of the pub, and put some [[coins]] in the snake charmer's money pot. He will give you a [[snake charm]] and a [[snake basket]]. Use ('''not''' Play) the snake charm on a desert snake, which can be found north of Ali the Operator's tent.\n\nNote: Even if you have received a snake charm from Ali the Snake Charmer from the quest [[Ratcatchers]], he will give you another (provided they are not in your bank, and you have two free inventory spaces).\n\nOnce you've brought the snake back to [[Ali the Hag]], she will tell you the second item she needs is fresh [[Ugthanki dung|camel dung]]. Go to [[Ali the Kebab seller]], located just north-west of the well in the centre of town, and ask for his [[red hot sauce]]. Take this to the camel shop, and use it on the food trough. Some '''dung''' appears – use a [[bucket]] on it. You might get '''green dung''', this is not the type you want, and it is totally random which '''dung''' you get, so keep trying. You want the '''nice brown dung''' or the '''Ugthanki dung.'''\n:'''Note:''' The camel automatically eats from the trough after hot sauce is poured into it, dung appears a few seconds after.\n:'''Note:''' You may want to gather three or four more Ugthanki dung, since it is used in [[My Arm's Big Adventure]] and possibly needed for [[Forgettable Tale of a Drunken Dwarf]].\n:'''Note:''' If you repeatedly add hot sauce to the trough it will disappear for a short time.\nTake the dung to Ali the Hag and she'll give you some poison to kill [[Traitorous Ali]].\n\nGo to the pub, use the poison on the table with the beer, and then go back to Ali the Operator.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nThe Feud - pouring hot sauce.png|Pouring the [[red hot sauce]] on the trough.\nThe Feud - poisonining drink.png|Pouring the hag's poison onto Traitorous Ali's drink.\n</gallery>\n\n===Finishing up===\n[[File:The Feud - Tough Guy safespot.png|thumb|The [[safespot]] for the [[Tough Guy]].]]\nPrepare yourself for the fight. [[Ali the Operator]] now tells you to talk to the [[Menaphite Leader]] (he magically appears outside the tent). You decide to kill the leader as he's just a little crazy with world domination schemes! A level 75 [[Tough Guy]] appears to fight you. Swiftly kill him! If you are a low level and it takes too long for you to kill him he will disappear. You can lure him behind the table inside the Menaphite Tent and kill him. (Note for magic users: unlike most quest bosses, the Tough Guy has a high magic defence. If your magic level is low, be prepared for a long fight. It is recommended that you bring the runes for at least 100 spells.)\n\n[[File:The Feud - Bandit champion safespot.png|thumb|The ideal safespot for the [[bandit champion]].]]\nTalk to a [[villager]]; they are angry with you for upsetting the balance of power and will tell you that you need to deal with the [[Bandit Leader]] too. He's just north-west of the village (just near the bandit side of village) near the [[Rug Merchant]]. Talk to the bandit leader, and you will tell him to leave town or else. The bandit leader tries to pay you, but you're firm about him leaving. He will not leave without a fight. Now, kill the level 70 [[bandit champion]] that the bandit leader summons. The player may [[safespot]] him behind the crate near the rug merchant (alternatively lure him into the tent to the east of the bandit leader and range/mage over the chairs). The bandit champion will drop an [[adamant scimitar]] upon defeat.\n\nTalk to the villagers to find out that they are still ungrateful! '''Note:''' You must speak to a villager, otherwise the mayor will not appear.\n\nNext, talk to [[Ali the Mayor]]. He is a little more grateful about the results of your deeds. You can find him at the well, in the centre of the village. He will tell you of [[Ali Morrisane]]'s nephew. Now, go back to Ali Morrisane to claim the reward.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Feud\n|image = [[File:The Feud reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Thieving|15,000}} [[Thieving]] [[experience]]\n*500 [[coins]]\n*An [[oak blackjack]]\n*A [[desert disguise]] (created during the quest)\n*A [[willow blackjack]] (as a drop from the [[tough guy]])\n*An [[adamant scimitar]] (as a drop from the [[bandit champion]])\n*Access to the [[Rogue Trader]] [[miniquest]] – Completing this will allow [[Ali Morrisane]] to sell [[blackjack]]s, various [[runes]], and different clothing from around the [[Kharidian Desert]]\n*The ability to pickpocket [[villager]]s, [[Bandit (Pollnivneach)|bandits]], and [[Menaphite thug]]s in Pollnivneach\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of The Feud is required for the following:\n*[[My Arm's Big Adventure]]\n*[[Rogue Trader]]\n*[[Hard Desert Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The combination to the mayor's safe is the first 6 terms of the {{Wp|Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence}}.\n*Even though the [[bandit champion]] wields a [[steel scimitar]], he will drop an [[adamant scimitar]].\n*If you decide to go back to the urchin and pay him, you can ask him about various aspects of [[Pollnivneach]], including the gangs, and the town itself.\n*If you don't pay the urchin and then talk to him again he'll make a reference to Team Rocket from Pokémon.\n*When asking [[Ali the Barman]] about [[Traitorous Ali]], the player learns about the rare existence of [[toilet]]s in [[Gielinor]], as Traitorous Ali is said to be travelling to [[Fossil Island]] to visit its outhouse.\n*If you try to use the red hot sauce on the beer instead of the poison, you will say \"You know what? This is childish. I'm not doing it.\".\n*While completing the quest, your character will realise that the main reason [[Ali Morrisane]] sent you to Pollnivneach was so that you would buy a [[desert disguise]] from him as well as the camels and hot sauce, thus proving that Ali Morrisane is, in fact, the greatest merchant in all of RuneScape.\n*Upon completion of the quest Ali Morrisane refers to his nephew as \"Baba\", making a reference to ''{{Wp|Ali Baba|Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves}}''.\n*When speaking to [[Ali the Hag]], she will tell you that you can't call her \"Al\". This is a reference to the song \"{{Wp|You Can Call Me Al}}\" by {{Wp|Paul Simon}}.\n*After talking to the Ali the mayor about the last events, if you go and talk to Ali the bar man, you can tell that the beer was poisoned and he will thank you for not ruining his reputation and give you a beer.\n*After this quest, many NPCs whose names were \"Ali\" will have their names changed back to their real names.\n\n{{The Feud}}\n{{Pollnivneach}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Feud, The}}"

('''Note''': You can use the [[Fishing Trawler]] [[grouping teleport]] to get there quickly if you have 15 [[Fishing]].) Alternatively, you could use the Ardougne cloak's teleport to the Kandarin Monastery and run south west.\n\nAsk her what's wrong, and she will explain that her family has been kidnapped by [[General Khazard]]. Offer to help her.\n\n{{Map|2613,3190|mtype=pin|align=right|height=220|width=220|caption=The location of the suit of armour containing the [[Khazard armour|armour]].}}\n[[File:Fight Arena - Khazard armour chest.png|thumb|220px|The chest containing the [[Khazard armour|armour]].]]\nWalk east to a group of buildings located south of the local [[Ardougne Monastery|Monastery]]. The most north-eastern house contains one suit of armour (north wall 2nd from the east) which you are able to borrow and doing so contains the [[Khazard armour]], crucial to complete the quest. After equipping both pieces of armour, head to the prison, which forms the south and east boundaries of the [[Fight Arena (location)|Fight Arena]].\n\n:'''Note:''' You are able to take multiple sets of armour using the drop and click method (dropping the armour then searching the chest again).\n\nTo save Lady Servil's family, you have to infiltrate the jail (south of the building with the chest). On trying to enter the prison, the door is locked, though the guards mistake the player as a [[Khazard Guard]] and let them in, as long as the player is wearing the Khazard armour retrieved earlier. Once inside, do not remove the Khazard armour as the guards will not speak to you without it equipped. You can wear anything else on you, as the guards are too daft to notice them.\n\n===Inside the arena===\n{{Needed|5 coins}}\n[[File:Khazard Guard chathead.png|left]]\n[[Sammy Servil]] (the boy in the purple shirt) is located in the northernmost cell of the east wing of the prison. Ask him where the [[Khazard cell keys|cell keys]] are, and he will explain the guard has them.\n\nIn the south-eastern corner of the jail, you will find the Head Guard by the staircase. Talk to the Head Guard, and you will find out that he wants a decent drink, [[Khali brew]], to be exact. He will also tell you that if he had too much, he would fall asleep. (The Head Guard is not attackable, so there's no risk of accidentally drawing his aggression.)\n\n'''You must talk to the guard before purchasing the brew, or the bartender will not offer it.'''\n\nThe only bar that sells the brew is the one west of the western entrance to the jail. Khali brew is sold for five [[coins]]. Once you have purchased the brew from the [[Khazard barman]], head back to the jail and offer it to the Head Guard, who will get drunk and give you the keys.\n\nGet out your [[combat]] [[equipment]] and prepare for three enemies you must fight in a row, although most players will find them relatively easy due to there being [[safespot]]s.\n\nUse the keys on Sammy's prison door to free him after which you and Sammy will enter the main arena in search of his father [[Justin Servil|Justin]], who is being attacked by a [[Khazard ogre]].\n\n===The battles===\n[[File:General Khazard chathead.png|left]]\n\n{{Instance}}\n\n:'''Note: The [[dwarven multicannon]] cannot be set up in the arena.'''\n\nTo save [[Sammy Servil|Sammy]]'s father, [[Justin Servil|Justin]], slay the attacking level 63 [[Khazard Ogre]]. You can lure the Ogre behind a skeleton and use [[Magic]], [[Ranged]] or a [[halberd]] for an easy fight. Alternately, you can turn on [[Protect from Melee]] and [[melee]] it. If a fight sequence does not initiate, speak to Justin in order to continue. '''Note:''' If the fight sequence has already started, and you talk to Justin, a second Ogre will appear that you will have to kill.\n\n[[General Khazard]] will then appear to tell you that in order for the Servils to be spared, you must become a fight slave. You will be locked in a prison cell. To continue in the quest, you must talk to Hengrad, your cellmate, to continue with the fights.\n\nThe second fight is with a level 44 [[Khazard scorpion]]. It's not poisonous, so another easy fight. It will be easily defeated by using the same tactics used to defeat the Ogre.\n\n[[File:Fight Arena - Fighting General Khazard.png|thumb|right|Fighting [[General Khazard]] with [[Magic]] using the [[safespot]].]]\nAfter defeating the scorpion, Khazard will release [[Bouncer]] (level 137). Bouncer is stronger than regular [[hellhound]]s, so do not underestimate him. You can once again use the safespot or alternatively you can melee him, Protect from Melee being rather helpful. If you do not have that prayer, bring high healing [[food]].\n\n'''Note:''' If you do forget to bring any ranged gear or [[food]] to help with combat, you are able to teleport out to gather items and return to continue the quest. When returning, speak to the [[Khazard Guard]] outside the by the door of the prison and he will take you back into the arena.\n\nOnce Bouncer is defeated, [[General Khazard]] (level 142) will become enraged at his only friend dying and will attack, trying to kill you himself. The Servils will escape whether or not he is killed; you do not have to fight General Khazard to claim the reward of the quest. You can simply walk out of the door (use its Quick-escape option to avoid having to confirm you wish to leave), and once you have walked away, General Khazard will not pursue you. If you do decide to kill him, you can once again simply trap him behind a skeleton.\n\nAfter you exit the arena, return to [[Lady Servil]] to finish the quest and to get your reward.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Fight Arena\n|image = [[File:Fight Arena reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Attack|12,175}} [[Attack]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Thieving|2,175}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*1,000 [[coins]]\n*The [[Khazard armour set]]\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Bouncer]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Fight Arena is required for the following:\n*[[The General's Shadow]]\n*[[While Guthix Sleeps]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n*[[Attack 4]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*General Khazard will refer to the player as \"him,\" regardless of gender.\n*Players can avoid fighting the next creature between battles by moving around instead of continuing to the next battle, allowing players to rest before entering the next.

The problem is, the only lead he's got is an extremely drunken and kebab obsessed dwarf.\n\nUse your farming and brewing abilities to your advantage, then prepare to be perplexed by puzzles as you follow the trail to the [[Red Axe]]...\n|length = Long\n|requirements = *{{SCP|Cooking|22|link=yes}} {{Boostable|yes}} {{Questreqstart|}}\n*{{SCP|Farming|17|link=yes}} {{Boostable|yes}} {{Questreqstart|}}\n*Completion of the following quests:\n**[[The Giant Dwarf]]\n**[[Fishing Contest]]\n|items = *~400 [[coins]]\n*2 [[barley malt]] (no range in Keldagrim, plain barley has to be cooked elsewhere)\n*2 [[buckets of water]]\n*[[Seed dibber]] (no Tool leprechaun in Keldagrim) or partial completion of the [[Farming]] portion of the [[Barbarian Training]] [[miniquest]]\n*[[Rake]] (obtainable during the quest)\n*[[Ale yeast]] (or a [[Pot]] (obtainable during the quest) + 25 coins)\n*[[Kebab]] (purchasable during quest for 1 coin)\n*2 [[beer]]s (purchasable during quest for 1-2 coins each)\n*[[Beer glass]] (obtainable during the quest)\n*A random item from the list below (see list for details)\n|recommended = '''Recommended'''\n*A [[Games necklace]]/[[Camelot teleport]] (to get to [[White Wolf Mountain]] quickly) ''or'' [[Ring of dueling]] and access to the [[Gnome glider]] network west of the [[Emir's Arena]]\n*An [[Enchanted lyre]]/[[Slayer ring]]/[[Keldagrim minecart system]] (to teleport near [[Keldagrim]] entrance faster)\n|leagueRegion = <poem>\n{{RE|Asgarnia}} — location requirement\n{{RE|Fremennik}} — location requirement\n{{RE|Kandarin}} — location requirement\nA random unobtainable item may be requested by the [[Rowdy Dwarf]].

If you don't want to do this quest intermittently, you can bring something to fill this time with, such as runes and items for [[High Level Alchemy]]. For the first waiting period there is a bank nearby.\n\n===Starting out===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Beer]] (or 2 [[coins]] to buy one)''\n[[File:Commander Veldaban chathead.png|left]]\nHead to [[Keldagrim]]. A great way to get there is by using the [[Grouping]] teleport to [[Blast Furnace]]. Another great way is to use the cart trapdoor in the north-western part of [[Grand Exchange]]. The [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|dks}} will bring you right next to the entrance to Keldagrim. There are also cart rides from the [[Dwarven Mine]], the underground [[White Wolf Mountain]] passageway, and [[Dorgesh-Kaan]] (if you completed the quest [[Another Slice of H.A.M.]]).\n\nTo start this quest, talk to [[Veldaban]], Commander of the [[Dwarven Black Guard|Black Guard]] in the Black Guard H.Q., west of the Keldagrim bank. He is rather shocked to tell you that, after the incident at the end of [[The Giant Dwarf]], the [[Red Axe]] company has completely left Keldagrim, causing disorder within the [[Consortium]].\n\nHowever, he finds this to be rather suspicious, and wants you to investigate the mining group. The only lead the Black Guard currently has is that there is a [[Drunken Dwarf (Keldagrim)|dwarf]] living in east Keldagrim who acts strangely whenever the company is mentioned.\n\nAgree to help Veldaban, and you will automatically be transported to the dwarf's house in east Keldagrim after a short cutscene. Speak to the dwarf, who is rather drunk and will ask you for a drink. Talk to him to give him the beer. Beer can be bought in the [[Laughing Miner Pub]] or the [[King's Axe Inn]] for two coins. He, however, wants \"some of the REALLY good stuff\", which is an incredibly alcoholic drink called [[Kelda stout]].\n\n===Getting the seeds===\n'''''Items required:''' Random item (see below), and a [[beer glass]] or [[beer]] (purchasable for 1 coin). Recommended: 200 coins to take the [[Keldagrim minecart system|minecart]] train to [[White Wolf Mountain]].''\n\nTo make the drink, you need to grow some [[kelda hops]] from 4 [[kelda seed]]s, possessed by some of his drunken friends - namely [[Khorvak]], [[Gauss]] and the [[rowdy dwarf]].\n[[File:Forgettable Tale toast.png|200px|thumb|Cheers!]]\n*The [[Drunken Dwarf (Keldagrim)|drunken dwarf]] gives the first seed to set you off.\n*For the next seed, go to the [[Laughing Miner]] pub (directly south of the drunken dwarf's house) and you should see the [[Rowdy dwarf]], circling around the pub. He asks you for a random item in exchange for another seed. See the list of items and how to obtain them below. Before teleporting outside of Keldagrim to obtain whatever item you're asked for (if needed), proceed to obtaining the next seed.\n*For the third seed, go to the [[White Wolf Mountain]] by using the [[minecart]]s. In the pub, talk to [[Khorvak, a dwarven engineer]]. Convince him that you will bring the seed back when you are done, and he will let you \"borrow\" it. Alternatively, you may give him a dwarven stout from a nearby table in exchange for the seed.\n*For the last seed, go to the west side of [[Keldagrim]] and talk to [[Gauss]]. He is in the [[King's Axe Inn]], south of the bank in west Keldagrim. He will ask you to do a toast with him. If you don't have an empty beer glass, buy a beer and toast with him to get the seed. You may toast with an empty beer glass or with a full beer; toasting with a full beer will not consume the beer, and it may be used later in the quest.\n\n{| class=\"mw-collapsible\" style=\"text-align:left;\" mw-collapsed \"\n!The Rowdy Dwarf may ask you for one of the following (if you cannot obtain the item, wait a few minutes and talk to him again for a different request):\n|-\n|\n*'''{{plink|Potion (Apothecary)|txt=Acne potion}}''' - [[Varrock]] [[apothecary]].

If you have [[Explorer's ring 2]], you can teleport to the cabbage patch south of Falador. He '''<u>''will not accept''</u>''' the special [[Cabbage (Draynor Manor)|Draynor Manor variety]].\n*'''{{plink|Right eye patch|txt=Eye patch}}''' - Any [[trader crewmember]] next to the [[charter ship]]s.\n*'''{{plink|Fake beard}}''' - Bought from [[Ali Morrisane]], north of the Palace in [[Al Kharid]].\n*'''{{plink|Flyer}}''' - Not tradeable.

Ask [[Rind the gardener]] for advice on planting the seeds, and he will explain that sunlight is harmful for kelda seeds and hence you can only grow it underground. He then gives you permission to use the [[Kelda hops]] patch. Pick up the rake to the south if needed.\n\nWeed the garden using a rake, plant the hops, and wait 15-20 minutes. You don't have to be online, but logging in and out will reset the timer. You'll get a notification when the hops are ready saying: ''Perhaps I should take a look and see if my Kelda hops have grown...'' The hops don't require attention or water and cannot get diseased, as they are known for having a remarkably fast growing speed.\n\nIf you need something to pass the time, you can talk to [[Rind the gardener]] and deliver a [[Letter (Forgettable Tale...)|letter]] for him; you must take it to [[Elstan]], the gardener at the allotment south of [[Falador]] (you can quickly reach him using the cabbage port from the [[Explorer's ring]] 2, 3, or 4), then go back to Keldagrim to Rind to get two [[marrentill seed]]s. Note: You can only do this delivery during this stage of this quest; this little side quest is no longer available after picking the hops. If you tell Rind that you do not want to deliver the letter after receiving it, you will also not be able to complete the side quest anymore.\n\nWhen your seeds have grown, pick the Kelda hops.\n\nYou now need to head to the bar in East Keldagrim and up the stairs to the [[fermenting vat]]. '''The vat at Port Phasmatys cannot be used'''; the vat will give the message, \"These special hops need to be brewed in the Keldagrim brewery. Oh well...\" If you already have contents in the fermenting vat bring 8 beer glasses or 2 calquat kegs to empty them. If the contents are still fermenting you can drain the vat by using the valve (whatever contents were fermenting in this vat will be lost).\n\nIf ready to brew the ale, use two [[bucket of water|buckets of water]] on the vat, then add two [[barley malt]], then the [[kelda hops]]. If you didn't bring [[ale yeast]], take the [[pot]] from the nearby table and ask [[Blandebir]] to fill it up with ale yeast for 25gp. Use the ale yeast on the vat and the fermenting process will begin. This will take another 15–20 minutes and you will get a notification when it's ready.\n\nWhen it's done fermenting, turn the valve (behind the barrel) and use a [[beer glass]] on the barrel. Head to the [[Drunken Dwarf (Keldagrim)|Drunken Dwarf]]'s house just north and talk about the [[Red Axe]]. He will ask for the [[Kelda stout]] and then tell you about the boarded up tunnel along with a small cutscene.\n\n===Exploring the closed tunnel===\n'''''Items required:''' None, Two empty inventory spaces, Empty weapon and shield slot (You need both hands free)''\n\n[[File:Cart Conductor.png|thumb|left|200px|Cart Conductor and the blocked passage]]\nTalk to the [[cart conductor]] to the south at the train cart tracks (only one of the conductors will give you the option to ask about the closed off tunnel, which would be the one furthest south, nearest to the closed off tunnel). Now, talk to the director of the mining company that you joined during [[The Giant Dwarf]] quest, which is located upstairs in either the west or the east marketplace. Ask them for help with the boarded up tunnel, and they will have the boards removed at once. Go back to the conductor and ride the cart that goes into the new tunnel (the most southern cart, no ticket required). Make sure to remove any held items in your hands before riding the cart.\n\nYou will find yourself before a gigantic abyss at the end of the cart ride. A short cutscene shows the vastness of the area, along with tracks floating out in all directions.\n\n''If you log out at anytime while in the cave, you will be transported out in the city, and your progress will be saved.''\n\n====Room 1====\nTo proceed, you will need to head through one of the many exits on the other side of the chasm. First, you need to solve a puzzle to set the tracks to the exit. Collect the [[square stone]]s from the [[box (Forgettable Tale...)|box]] next to the controls, and set them in the dwarven machinery. A green stone will make the cart take the top path at a junction, and a yellow stone will make it take the bottom path.\n\nYour goal is to set up a connection between the red square all the way to the left and the boxes that are to the right. To place/rotate a stone in a junction, click '''''once''''' for green, '''''twice''''' for yellow, and '''''three times''''' to remove the stone. The green line shows the path the cart will take. The chest at the top of Room 1 cannot be reached.\n\n\n# To get past this room, operate the controls and place the '''yellow''' stone on the farthest spot to the left and the '''green''' stone one spot below that, as shown below. Hop onto the cart, and search the box on the platform that you reach to obtain another green [[square stone]]. Take the cart back to the control box.\n# There are two ways to go forward with the next one: either '''green, yellow, green''' or '''green, green, yellow'''. Ride the cart again, search the box for a second yellow stone, and return to the control box.\n# Finally, connect the stones to the red cross, with the '''two yellow''' blocks on the left hand side and '''two green''' blocks on the right hand side. Ride the cart to reach the second room.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nForgettable Tale - cart 1-1.png|Part 1\nForgettable Tale - cart 1-2.png|Part 2\nForgettable Tale - cart 1-3.png|Part 3\n</gallery>\n\n====Room 2====\n[[File:Forgettable Tale - eavesdropping.png|thumb|200px|Overhearing an important conversation...]]\nIn this room, you eavesdrop on a conversation between [[Hreidmar]] (the Red Axe Director), an [[Grunsh|Ogre Shaman]], and a [[Colonel Grimsson|Red Axe Henchman]] discussing their plans. You learn that [[The Red Axe]] bribed the boatman into deliberately crashing into the statue so that they could blame it on a human in [[The Giant Dwarf]] quest. Crawl through the hole at the opposite end of the room from where you entered.\n\n====Room 3====\nYou'll now be in another minecart abyss. Search the box to receive two yellow and one green stone. The chest at the top of Room 3 is empty when searched.\n\n# Put the '''green''' stone on the far left, a '''yellow''' one above it, and another '''yellow''' one to the right. Ride the cart, search the box, and ride back.\n# Put a '''yellow''' stone at the far left, another '''yellow''' one spot below that, a '''green''' one below that, and another '''green''' to the right. Ride the cart, search the box, and ride back.\n# Put a '''green''' stone on the far left, another '''green''' one spot above that, a '''yellow''' one spot above that, a '''green''' to the right and below, and a '''yellow''' to the right. Ride the cart into the fourth room.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nForgettable Tale - cart 2-1.png|Part 1\nForgettable Tale - cart 2-2.png|Part 2\nForgettable Tale - cart 2-3.png|Part 3\n</gallery>\n\n====Room 4====\nYou appear in a small archive room, with a number of bookcases and crates, the ones with visible contents being searchable. Search the three crates. One contains papers concerning statistical data, salary structures, and shopping lists. The other two, however, are much more interesting. '''YOU MUST ALSO SEARCH A BOOKCASE BEFORE MOVING ON.'''\n\n*There is a copy of a letter addressed to the dwarven boatman, signed by [[Colonel Grimsson]]. It speaks of the bribe, which was part of the plans you overheard earlier, so that the boatman takes along some gullible human on his boat to blame and destroy the statue of King Alvis:\n\n{{Cquote2|\n<center> I am writing to advise you that our secret preparations to the statue have been completed. All you need to do now is hit it with your boat. Take some gullible human along when you do, the mines are crawling with them these days. The human will surely get the major blame.</center>\n\n<center> After this, the statue is going to be rebuilt in the image of our great director. You need not concern yourself with the how and why, but rest assured you will be compensated greatly.</center>|Regards, Colonel Grimsson of the Red Axe}}\n*The other letter is a report on an exploring dwarf who entered the mines - your new buddy, the [[Drunken Dwarf (Keldagrim)|drunken dwarf]] - whose memory was wiped to avoid any risk:\n\n{{Cquote2|Report on Intruder\n\n\nWe found a dwarf wandering in our mines. We weren't sure if he was a spy or simply an explorer, but we couldn't take any risks. We decided to send him back with his memory wiped, rather than put him to use as one of our test subjects. We can't afford having to explain another mysterious disappearance at this point. Additionally, we added something to the spell that would make him hungry for kebabs and thirsty for beer, so that whatever he can remember will be dismissed as the ravings of a drunken fool. Grunsh did a good job, he seems to be fitting in well. Nevertheless, the spell seems to have been a little bit too strong, the subject is unlikely to recover from his condition. His obsession with kebabs is a bit too extreme. Will tell Grunsh to adjust his spell next time.}}\n\n*One of the books in the bookcases contains information on [[Red Axe]] employees, in particular Colonel Grimsson and [[Grunsh]], the Red Axe Henchman and ogre shaman encountered earlier:\n\n{{Cquote2|Red Axe Employee Records\n\n\nHreidmar, director of the Red Axe (employee #1)\n\nInformation classified.\n\nGrimsson, the butcher of Barendir (employee #4297)\n\nGrimsson was once a soldier in the dwarven army and quickly made his way up the ranks, up to colonel. He served with the Black Guard at Ice Mountain and in Kandarin. He was present at the battle of Barendir when he fought against an army of trolls. It was here that he got his nickname, the Butcher of Barendir, as he mercilessly killed the trolls even as they retreated in defeat. Here, also, he got his distinctive scar running across his forehead in a hand-to-hand battle with a particularly ferocious troll. After this battle Grimsson became more and more aggressive, even to his fellow dwarves. Following a particularly vicious attack on a comrade, he was dismissed from the Black Guard. Soon after, he was recruited by the Red Axe. Here he's learned to control his rage and become even stronger. By now, he has become the right hand dwarf of the director. While he holds no official rank, he is still often affectionately referred to as 'The Colonel'.\n\nGrunsh, Ogre Shaman (employee #38262)\n\nFound lost and near death in the ice cold mountains above Keldagrim, Grunsh was nearly mistaken for a troll at first. Taken in by the Red Axe and nursed back to health, it turned out that he was in fact a powerful ogre shaman. Intelligent by ogre standards, and steadfastly loyal to his rescuers, he has taken up a prominent position in the ranks of the Red Axe. This is primarily due to the fact that since dwarves cannot use magic, they must rely on other races as spellcasters. Grunsh fits the bill perfectly.}}\n\n====Room 5====\nMoving forward from the reports room, you arrive at the final chasm. Search the box for two yellow and two green stones.\n\n# Put a '''green''' stone on the far left, a '''green''' stone one above that, a '''yellow''' stone one above that, and a '''yellow''' one to the right. Ride, search, and ride back.\n# Put a '''yellow''' stone on the far left, another '''yellow''' one below that, another '''yellow''' one below that, a '''green''' to the right, a '''green''' above that, and another '''green''' above that. Ride, search, and ride back.\n# Put a '''green''' stone on the far left, another '''green''' one above that, a '''yellow''' one above that, a '''green''' to the right of that, a '''yellow''' above, a '''green''' below, a '''yellow''' above, then a '''yellow''' below. Ride to the sixth and final room.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nForgettable Tale - cart 3-1.png|Part 1\nForgettable Tale - cart 3-2.png|Part 2\nForgettable Tale - cart 3-3.png|Part 3\n</gallery>\n\n====Room 6====\n[[File:Forgettable Tale chaos dwarf army.png|right|thumb|Hreidmar assembles his army.]]\n[[File:Forgettable Tale memory wipe.png|right|thumb|The shaman casts a memory-erasing spell.]]\nA cutscene starts, where the [[Red Axe Director]] will show off his army of [[Chaos Dwarves]]. But, before you can report to [[Commander Veldaban]] of what you've seen so far, [[Grunsh]] the Ogre shaman catches you prying into their plans and casts a spell that eliminates all your memories of the caves.\n\n===Finishing===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Kebab]] (purchase from kebab shop for 1 coin), [[beer]] (buy from barmaid for 2 coins)''\n\nGo back and talk to [[Commander Veldaban]], where you began the quest. ('''Note:''' Drinking the beer/eating the kebab before talking to Commander Veldaban will not initiate the cut scene.) You won't remember any of what had happened, but your instincts will tell you to go to the [[Laughing Miner Pub|Laughing Miner]] pub in east [[Keldagrim]] and have a beer and kebab. Buy a kebab from the store on the east side (directly south-west of the [[Drunken Dwarf (Keldagrim)|drunken dwarf]]'s house) and a beer from the pub. Now, drink the beer/eat the kebab in the east pub to begin the final cutscene. You will get drunk and tell a nonsensical story to a bunch of drunken dwarves.\n\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nForgettable Tale of a Drunken Dwarf drinking.png|Telling kebab stories to other drunken dwarves.\nForgettable Tale - blacked out.png|The player blacks out from excessive drinking.\nForgettable Tale - Grimsson.png|Grimsson exiting the pub.\n</gallery>\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Forgettable Tale...\n|image = [[File:Forgettable Tale of a Drunken Dwarf reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Cooking|5,000}} [[Cooking]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Farming|5,000}} [[Farming]] experience\n*2 [[Dwarven stout (m)]]\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The player character commenting on how half the world seems to be farmers is referring to the [[Farming]] skill being released in the same month as this quest.\n*The quest journal will have revisions once an [[Grunsh|ogre shaman]] alters your memory:\n**''Hi hi hi ha ha ha ha.''\n**''Lalalalalalalalala.''\n**''Rock hot nice butterfly bad wolf sing song down the river.''\n**''I saw...

Then go back to [[Undor]] and tell him: '''I've been sent to help you.'''\n\nHe will explain that the Doors have been purposely damaged by someone or something, creating a small hole in the doors. Although not much, it is enough for the [[Wintertodt]] imprisoned within to draw a small amount of power into the prison.\n\nUndor can easily fix the damage done, but he needs [[Dinh's hammer]] in order to repair the doors, which he believes is located in the [[The Forsaken Tower (location)|Forsaken Tower]], located on the peninsula due west of Lovakengj and due east{{Direction}} of [[Mount Karuulm]].\n\nFairy ring {{Fairycode|cir}} takes you to the base of Mount Karuulm. Alternatively, players can use their [[Battlefront teleport]] to get to the graveyard directly south of the Forsaken Tower.\n\n'''Tip:''' Players with 70 [[Smithing]] planning to complete a [[Kourend & Kebos Diary#Hard|hard task]] for the [[Kourend & Kebos Diary]] should also bring an [[adamantite ore]] and six [[coal]]. '''{{Colour|red|Warning}}:''' Be sure to follow the steps below before igniting the furnace; otherwise, you may take up to 34 damage.\n\n===The Quest for the Hammer===\n[[File:The Forsaken Tower - Undor needs a hammer.png|thumb|right|Undor requests help from the player.]]\n{{Map|name=The Forsaken Tower|x:1383,y:3813|plane=0|mapID=0|align=right|height=250|width=250|caption=The location of the Forsaken Tower.}}\nOnce you're inside the tower, inspect the [[Display Case (The Forsaken Tower)|display case]]. The interface shown displays each of the four puzzles required to unlock the case.\n\nOptionally, search the crate by the south-west corner to obtain an [[ancient letter]], which gives you a little more insight into the Tower's history.\n\n====The Forsaken Furnace====\n{{Needed|[[Tinderbox]]}}\nEnter one of the doors to the back room. Search the cupboards for a [[tinderbox]], and a [[5-gallon jug|5]] and [[8-gallon jug]].<br />\n'''{{Colour|red|Warning}}:''' Do not light [[Furnace (The Forsaken Tower)|the furnace]] before completing the next step or you will take over 20 hitpoints of damage.<br />\nIn the north-west corner of the room there is a [[coolant dispenser]]. The objective is to get 4 gallons in the 5 gallon jug, which can be done by following these steps:\n[[File:The Forsaken Tower - Adding coolant.png|thumb|right|Adding coolant to the coolant mechanism.]]\n{{Checklist|\n*Fill the 5-gallon jug with coolant making 5-0\n*Use the 5-gallon jug on the empty 8 gallon jug making 0-5\n*Fill the 5-gallon jug with coolant making 5-5\n*Use the 5-gallon jug on the 8 gallon jug making 2-8\n*Empty the 8 gallon jug (select \"check\" then \"empty\") making 2-0\n*Use the 5-gallon jug on the empty 8 gallon jug again making 0-2\n*Fill the 5-gallon jug with coolant making 5-2\n*Use the 5-gallon jug on the 8 gallon jug again making 0-7\n*Fill the 5-gallon jug with coolant making 5-7\n*Use the 5-gallon jug on the 8 gallon jug again making 4-8\n}}\n\nThe riddle is a math problem known as a {{WP|Water pouring puzzle}}, in which you must determine a multiple of 8s and 5s between which the difference is 4. Therefore, the solution is either to fill up the 5-gallon jug 4 times (+20) and emptying the 8-gallon twice (-16), or filling up the 8-gallon jug 3 times (+24) and emptying the 5-gallon jug 4 times (-20).\n\nYou should now have 4 gallons in the 5 gallon jug. Use the 5-gallon jug (with 4 gallons in it) on the [[furnace coolant]] mechanism on the left side of the furnace. Once it's full, light the furnace using your tinderbox.\n\n'''Note:''' Once the furnace has been lit, players can smelt an [[adamantite bar]] for a [[Kourend & Kebos Diary]] [[Kourend & Kebos Diary#Hard|hard task]].\n\n====The Powerless Grid====\n<gallery perrow=\"2\" align=\"center\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:The Forsaken Tower - Display case interface.png|The display case interface.\nFile:The Forsaken Tower - Powergrid solution.png|The powergrid solution.\n</gallery>\n\nGo into the basement using the ladder north to the [[Display Case (The Forsaken Tower)|display case]]  and search the crates in the room immediately east of the ladder until you find a [[generator crank]]. Start the [[steam generator]] using the crank. Once the generator is started, align the [[power grid]] in the centre of the room (solution above).\n\n====The Pernicious Potions====\n{{Needed|recommended=[[Antipoison]] and [[Food]].}}\nGo upstairs to the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}}. You will see a [[Table (The Forsaken Tower)|table of potions]] and a [[refinery]]. The refinery needs to be activated, but before it can be, it needs to be cleansed, by use of cleansing fluid. One of the [[unknown fluid|potions]] on the table is cleansing fluid, but the correct number is random for each player. Using the wrong fluid on the refinery will result in up to 40 damage and poisoning. With an antipoison and plenty of food, the puzzle can be brute-forced by trial and error.\n\n[[File:The Forsaken Tower - old notes explanation.png|thumb|300px|A visual explanation of the solution.]]\nTo solve which potion is the correct one, you can search the cupboard in the south-east{{Direction}} corner of the room to find [[old notes (The Forsaken Tower)|old notes]] with a riddle, which includes some potions' locations on the table relative to each other. The potion you need to get is the '''cleansing fluid'''. The riddle layout is the same for everyone, but the fluids differ.\n*Fluid A is directly left of Fluid B.\n*Fluid B is next to Fluid C.\n*Fluid D is directly right of Fluid E.\n*Fluid A is opposite Fluid D.\n\nFor the solution:\n*A has to be 1 (far left).\n*B has to be 2 (middle left).\n*C has to be 3 (middle).\n*D has to be 5 (far right).\n*E has to be 4 (middle right).\n\nOnce you've chosen the correct fluid, click on the refinery, cleanse it, and then activate it.\n\n====The Pylons====\n[[File:The Forsaken Tower - The altar.png|thumb|right|The altar at the top of the tower.]]\nGo up the ladder to the {{FloorNumber|uk=2}}. You will be in a room with three [[energy pylon]]s and a [[Runic Altar (The Forsaken Tower)|runic altar]]. The western pylon has four weighted [[energy disk]]s on it of varying size. The objective of this puzzle is to stack all of the rings in order on the middle pylon.\n\nRemove the disc from a pylon and place it on another pylon in the following order:\n{{Checklist|\n*From West '''(W)''' to East '''(E)'''\n*From '''W''' to Centre '''(C)'''\n*From '''E''' to '''C'''\n*From '''W''' to '''E'''\n*From '''C''' to '''W'''\n*From '''C''' to '''E'''\n*From '''W''' to '''E'''\n*From '''W''' to '''C'''\n*From '''E''' to '''C'''\n*From '''E''' to '''W'''\n*From '''C''' to '''W'''\n*From '''E''' to '''C'''\n*From '''W''' to '''E'''\n*From '''W''' to '''C'''\n*From '''E''' to '''C'''\n}}\nWith this done, all of the locks on the display case should be green. Go downstairs to the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} and retrieve [[Dinh's hammer]].\n\n===Finishing up===\nReturn to [[Undor]] at the [[Wintertodt Camp]], and give him [[Dinh's hammer]]. Now, he can fix the [[Doors of Dinh]], but even so, the [[pyromancer]]s will have to continue subduing the [[Wintertodt]], as it has already gained much power in the time the Doors were damaged. He will tell you to return to [[Lady Vulcana Lovakengj]], fairy ring code {{Fairycode|djr}} will teleport you just south of her. Speak to her to complete the quest and obtain your reward.\n\n'''Congratulations, Quest Complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Forsaken Tower\n|image = [[File:The Forsaken Tower reward scroll.png|center]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*{{SCP|Mining|500}} [[Mining]] experience\n*{{SCP|Smithing|500}} [[Smithing]] experience\n*6,000 [[coins]]\n*Free use of the [[Lovakengj Minecart Network]]\n*A page for [[Kharedst's memoirs]], '[[Jewellery of jubilation]].'

Brundt will request the player to investigate a minor disturbance that occurred the previous night near the sand pit. \n\nWhile here, also buy 2 [[kegs of beer]] from [[Thora the Barkeep]]. This saves time and effort later, unless you already have some in a bank.\n\nGo north to the house next to the [[sand pit]] and speak to [[Freygerd]]. Freygerd will retell the terrifying events of the previous night and how she was spooked by a pair of red eyes staring at her from outside the window. Go outside and investigate the surrounding area for clues.\n[[File:The Fremennik Exiles - killing the Basilisk Youngling.png|thumb|250px|A wild basilisk appeared!]]Investigate the following three clues to progress:\n{{Checklist|*Search the rockslide, directly west of Freygerd's house, to obtain a [[Fang (The Fremennik Exiles)|venomous fang]].\n*Search the boxes outside the house to obtain the [[venom gland]].\n*Finally, search the sand pit to uncover an aggressive level 57 [[Basilisk Youngling]] which will immediately attack you.}}\nThe Basilisk Youngling will consistently do 6 damage rapidly and drain the players' stats unless a mirror shield is equipped. An [[unsealed letter]] will be dropped upon killing the basilisk. Read the letter which contains information about an approaching basilisk invasion and the re-emergence of the [[Jormungand]]. Return to Freygerd and either tell her the truth or a comforting lie (it's random for each player), after which you should head back to Brundt the Chieftain to report.\n\nNote: Chieftain Brundt mentions talking to Reeso near the sandpit in his dialogue. If you cannot progress the quest using the directions above, try talking to Reeso as well.\n\nChieftain Brundt is horrified of the news of the basilisk invasion. Brundt reveals the history of Jormungand enslavement of the Fremennik people. The Jormungand, also known as the Serpent King, was the leader of the Basilisk army. His army, along with the three generals, [[Typhor]], [[Vritra]], and [[Bakuna]] brought terror to the lands. Freedom was restored after the hero, [[V]], confronted and magically sealed the Jormungand on the [[Island of Stone]]. Chieftain Brundt begins to panic at the powerlessness of the Fremennik army against the upcoming attack. You start reassuring Brundt and begin to plan a strategic countermeasure.\n[[File:The Fremennik Exiles - The Fremennik exiled.png|thumb|250px|The player is exiled from the Fremennik Province.]]\n\nA cutscene will play where the Council member [[Agnar]] arrives and inquires about the basilisk found in the town. Brundt informs Agnar that the situation will soon be resolved by you and Brundt. The enraged Agnar begins to blame you, the outerlander, for the disasters that have fallen upon the city ever since [[The Fremennik Trials]]. Agnar refuses to acknowledge you as a Fremennik and declares that seven of the twelve members have voted to exile you from the province. Brundt disagrees with the decision but is honour bound to follow the instructions of the council. Brundt, reluctantly, exiles you from the province while gesturing to the south-east.\n\nThe citizens of [[Rellekka]] will no longer view you as one of their own; attempting to interact will result in hostile warnings like prior to completion of [[The Fremennik Trials]]. However, all boat travel from the Rellekka port remains available.\n\n===Redeeming the exile===\nExit [[Rellekka]] from the southern entrance and head south-east along the dirt path. You will find [[Brundt the Chieftain]] nearby. Brundt apologises for the situation and explains why you were exiled. He requests that you forgive the Council members as they are being irrational due to the End of Things prophecy. The End of Things was foretold to begin after the Jormungand is freed. Brundt suggests you restore [[V's shield]] to regain the Council members trust and worth.\n\nBrundt will explain how to obtain the four components required to recreate V's shield. The shield was constructed with the assistance of the [[Moon Clan]] to create a shield that could reflect the Serpent King's gaze.\n\n[[File:Waterbirth Dungeon Map.png|thumb|Map of the Waterbirth Island Dungeon]]\n====Fremennik shield====\n{{Needed|[[Rune thrownaxe]] (bring 5-10), [[Pet rock]] for reaching [[Bardur]] if you don't have 85 agility or unless you already have a Fremennik shield or wish to kill market guards to obtain one|recommended=[[Stamina potions]], [[Combat equipment]], [[Food]], [[ring of charos (a)]] unless you already have a Fremennik shield or wish to kill market guards to obtain one}}\n\nThe [[Fremennik shield]] (not the tradeable [[Neitiznot shield]]) can be obtained as a drop from [[Dagannoth (Waterbirth Island)|dagannoths]] within the [[Waterbirth Island Dungeon]] and more rarely from [[market guard]]s, which will require the player to kill numerous of either of these to obtain it as a drop.\n\nAlternatively, the player can go find [[Bardur]], located deep within the Waterbirth Island Dungeon, to obtain a shield, either by paying {{Coins|150000}} or for free by charming Bardur while wearing the [[ring of charos (a)]] (this is a one-off exchange). It is possible to take [[Jarvald]]'s boat to [[Waterbirth Island]] despite being in exile.\n\nShould the player choose to find [[Bardur]], the dungeon contains enemies with all three attack styles, so bringing combat equipment, food, and using protection prayers is advised. (If you have 85 agility for the [[Waterbirth island rock climb|Waterbirth Island rock-climb]] shortcut you can bypass the [[pet rock]] and [[Rune thrownaxe|rune throwing axe]] steps and take the ladder down to sublevel 2). To reach [[Bardur]], the player should make their way through the first level of the dungeon by unlocking any of the three gates. This is done by dropping the [[pet rock]] on one floor button, standing on the other button, then interacting with the gate. At the end of the floor, the player must then use the special attack of the [[rune thrownaxe]] on the door supports to access the ladder leading down to the lower levels (if you're standing at the north or south door, target the west door, not the door directly across from you). From there, follow the ladders, down until the room with 2 ladders. Take the southern one there, and follow the ladders to end to find [[Bardur]]. The dungeon map shows a clear route to reach [[Bardur]]. A more comprehensive walk-through of the dungeon can be found on its [[Waterbirth Island Dungeon|wiki page]].\n\n====Lunar glass and V's sigil====\n{{Needed|[[Seal of passage]] (Unless elite [[Fremennik Diary]] is completed), [[molten glass]], 100 [[Astral rune]]s, 3 [[Lunar bar|Lunar bars]] (or [[Lunar ore|ores]]/any [[pickaxe]]), [[hammer]]\n|recommended=Teleports to [[Lunar Isle]], Teleports to [[Rellekka]] ([[Enchanted lyre]] or [[Fremennik sea boots 4|Fremennik Sea boots]])}}\n\nTalk to [[Baba Yaga]] on [[Lunar Isle]] about making Lunar glass. She will require a piece of [[molten glass]] and turn it into [[molten glass (i)]], which must then be brought to the [[Astral Altar]] along with 100 [[astral runes]] to infuse it to make [[lunar glass]].\n\nBefore heading to the Astral Altar to create the [[lunar glass]], if you need [[lunar ore]], enter the [[Lunar Isle mine]] north-east of the city. Mine three [[Lunar ore|lunar ores]] from the stalagmites, as three [[Lunar bar|lunar bars]] will be required to make the [[V sigil]].\n\nNow, head to the [[Astral Altar]] and use the [[molten glass (i)]], along with the 100 [[astral runes]] to create the [[lunar glass]].\n\nReturn back to [[Rellekka]] and head to the furnace and anvil in the south-west part of the city. Smelt the three [[lunar ore]]s into [[lunar bar]]s using the furnace. Then, use the three [[lunar bar]]s and a hammer on the anvil to create the [[V sigil]]. After doing so, the sigil must be brought to [[Fossegrimen]], who can be summoned from the strange altar on the small peninsula south-west of [[Rellekka]] (the same place you make offerings to enchant your lyre). [[Fossegrimen]] will need to be summoned by interacting with the strange altar. She will happily oblige to enchant the sigil in gratitude to [[V]].\n\n====Polishing rock====\n{{Needed|[[Pet rock]], [[Fishing rod]], [[Ice gloves]], [[Glassblowing pipe]]|recommended=2 teleports to the [[Mountain Camp]] ([[Slayer ring]] or [[fairy ring]] ({{Fairycode|AJR}}) access, Teleports back to [[Rellekka]] ([[Enchanted lyre]] or [[Fremennik sea boots 4|Fremennik Sea boots]])}}\n\nTo obtain a polishing rock, [[Brundt]] suggests submerging a rock in the hot springs in the mountains east of Rellekka. (Interaction with Brunt about the polishing rock is optional.) Go to the [[Mountain Camp]] with your [[pet rock]] (which can be obtained from [[Askeladden]]) and attempt to put it into the large geyser, which is on the south side of the lake, near the climbable tree. The player can not bring themselves to submerge their pet rock, due to their fond memories with their pet rock, and thus believes the only solution is to ask [[Peer the Seer]] to wipe their memory of the pet rock.\n[[File:The Fremennik Exiles - forgetting memories.png|thumb|250x250px|Peer the Seer erases your memories of you and your pet rock]]\nReturn to [[Rellekka]] and ask Peer the Seer to make you forget about your pet rock, which he will oblige to. Head back to the large geyser in the Mountain Camp with your emotionally unattached pet rock, a [[fishing rod]], and a pair of [[ice gloves]]. Wear the ice gloves, put the pet rock into the geyser and retrieve it again with the fishing rod to obtain the [[polishing rock]]. (If you forget to put your ice gloves on and you drop the rock into the geyser, simply pop them on and use the rod on the geyser to fish the rock out)\n\n====Return to Brundt====\n{{Needed|[[polishing rock]],  [[V sigil (e)]], [[lunar glass]], [[Fremennik Shield]], [[Glassblowing pipe]], 2 [[Keg of beer|Kegs of beer]]}}\n\nWith all four components and a [[glassblowing pipe]], [[V's shield]] is recreated by using the V sigil on the Fremennik Shield and your pet rock is returned. Return to [[Brundt the Chieftain]] south-east of Rellekka, who will be astonished by your craftmanship, and asks you to wield the shield in the upcoming battle against the basilisks. However, Brundt will have to return to Rellekka, end your exile and declare you as part of the Fremennik force against the basilisk invasion.\n\nBefore returning, he will ask you bring him two [[kegs of beer]] (if you forgot to buy them before starting the quest, buy them from [[Rasolo]] or on the [[Grand Exchange]]. The [[beer tankard]] from the table in the [[Longhall]] '''does not''' work), which you find out after giving him them that he needs them to get drunk enough to have the courage to declare ending your exile and rejoining the Fremennik. Before drinking the second keg, he will ask that you return to the Longhall. Market Guards and Warriors also drop kegs so if you choose this method to get the shield rather than going to the dungeon you will also get the kegs you need. \n\n===Basilisks in the Market===\n{{Needed|[[V's shield]], [[Combat equipment]], [[Food]]\n|recommended=Teleports to [[Lunar Isle]], Teleports back to [[Rellekka]] ([[Enchanted lyre]] or [[Fremennik sea boots 4|Fremennik Sea boots]])}}\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:The Fremennik Exiles - Battle of Rellekka.png|thumb|250x250px|Fighting the basilisks in the market alongside Brundt and Koschei]]\n\nReturn to the [[Longhall]] and talk to [[Brundt]] again, who has sobered up. He will tell you that the Council has decided to end your exile after your success of recreating [[V's shield]], and will declare you a Fremennik once more. He will ask that while the [[basilisks]] invade the town, you and he will travel to the [[Island of Stone]] to ensure [[The Jormungand]]'s prison remains sealed. However, as you ask when you'll be leaving, the basilisks invade the marketplace.\n\nWield [[V's shield]] and fight the basilisks until you reach 100%. You have to hit a basilisk at least once to make its death count towards completion.\n\n*[[Monstrous Basilisk (The Fremennik Exiles)|Monstrous Basilisks]] (level 135) counts for 10% completion.\n*[[Basilisks]] (level 61) counts for 3.33% completion.\n\nOnce you have defeated enough basilisks, Brundt will direct you to the north-westernmost Fremennik Boat. Board it to travel to the [[Island of Stone]].\n\nOnce you've travelled to the Island of Stone, you can freely travel back and forth by speaking to [[Haskell]]. You can leave to recuperate for the next battles.\n\n===Island of Stone===\n{{Needed|[[V's shield]], [[Combat equipment]] to fight [[Typhor]] (level 218) and [[The Jormungand]] (level 363), High-healing [[food]], 1-2 [[Super restore(4)]]}}\n{{Instance|irs=Brundt the Chieftain|cost=50000}}\n\nUpon arriving on the [[Island of Stone]], [[Brundt]] discovers that [[The Jormungand]]'s prison has already been breached, and that the [[basilisks]] have resealed the door. The door puzzle is similar to the real-life game of [[Wikipedia:Mastermind (board game)|Mastermind]], but uses six different rune symbols instead of coloured balls (air, water, earth, fire, astral and cosmic):\n\n*Each green check means one of the runes is perfect.\n*Each red check means a rune is correct but in the wrong position.\n*A rune can appear more than once in the solution.\n\n[[File:The Fremennik Exiles - fighting Typhor.png|thumb|250x250px|The player and Brundt fight the Jormungand's basilisk generals.]]\nIf you fail to solve the combination 9 times (8 guesses displayed on the board followed by one last attempt), the puzzle will reset and the solution will change. If you're struggling, try guessing a random combination of runes and close the puzzle if it's not mostly correct on the '''first''' guess; the puzzle will be different when you try to open the door again. Repeat until you get a helpful first guess. The puzzle can also be solved using [https://nebupookins.github.io/JS-Mastermind-Solver/ this tool]; enter the string \"Air, Water, Earth, Fire, Astral, Cosmic\" for the colors, and check \"Allow duplicate colors.\"\n\nOnce you solve the puzzle, the door will open. The door is a checkpoint; once opened you will not have to solve the puzzle again. You will see [[Bakuna]], [[Typhor]] and [[Vritra]] attempt to awaken [[The Jormungand]]. Brundt will fight Vritra, while you will fight Typhor. As Typhor may attack with either magic or melee, players with high melee defence and/or low magic defence (i.e. most melee armour) will find it more helpful to pray protect from magic for the entire fight as it blocks all damage from his magic attack. This fight is a checkpoint, meaning that if you slay Typhor but die to the Jormungand, when you return to battle you will not have to fight Typhor again.\n\n[[File:The Fremennik Exiles - The Jormungand is freed.png|thumb|250x250px|Bakuna frees the Jormungand from his imprisonment.]]\n\n====== The Fight ======\nDespite your efforts, Bakuna successfully awakens The Jormungand, who consumes Bakuna in order to restore his strength. You and Brundt now must battle the Jormungand. It is level 363, and primarily attacks with magic, making [[Protect from Magic]] very useful (it won't block all damage from his magic attack, but it will significantly reduce it, to a maximum hit of around 5, sometimes 7). If you die or teleport away from the Jormungand before killing it, you must restart the fight, but you will not have to kill Typhor again. On death, items can be retrieved from Brundt on the island, for a cost of 50,000 coins (can be from your bank).\n\nThe fight is quite simple once you know the mechanics (listed below), but can take up to ten minutes depending on your levels and gear. Because of this, at least one prayer potion or super restore potion is advised (more if using [[Piety]], which is highly recommended). The Jormungand is slightly weak to crush attacks; however, it still has very high defence, so a high strength weapon such as a [[Zombie axe]], [[leaf-bladed battleaxe]], or [[dragon mace]] is recommended. The Jormungand is immune to poison, so poisoned weapons are not recommended.\n\n'''Players must wield V's shield for the fight otherwise Typhor and The Jormungand will drain the players stats and hit 18s repeatedly.'''\n\nThe Jormungand has two special attacks that players should note:\n[[File:The Fremennik Exiles - The Jormungand eyes attack.png|left|thumb|250x250px|The Jormungand uses one of his special attacks, which can be negated by walking away from him.]]\n\n*The Jormungand will prepare a powerful attack indicated by the player's screen turning red. Face away from the Jormungand to avoid it, otherwise players will take up to 50 damage and have their stats drained by 20.\n*The Jormungand will launch a projectile that encases the player in stone. Repeatedly attempt to attack the Jormungand to quickly break free. If players take too long to try freeing themselves, the stone will violently break, dealing over 40 damage. The mechanic is virtually identical to the vines used by the [[Hespori]].\n\nOnce the Jormungand is defeated, the player will wonder whether the End of Things had already begun; Brundt will refute this by saying that if it had begun, they would have already noticed. Content, you and Brundt will return to the longhall to drink and celebrate.\n\nFrom now on, the Fremennik will refer to you by your [[Fremennik name]] followed by the honorific Dräpare. \n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n{{clear|left}}\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=The Fremennik Exiles|image=[[File:The Fremennik Exiles reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=2|rewards=*[[V's shield]]\n*Access to the [[Island of Stone]]\n* Ability to kill a [[Basilisk Knight]] as a [[Slayer]] Task\n*A Fremennik honorific, Dräpare, added to the player's [[Fremennik name]]\n*Ability to create and equip the [[Neitiznot faceguard]]\n*{{SCP|Slayer|50,000}} [[Slayer]] experience\n*{{SCP|Crafting|50,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*{{SCP|Runecraft|30,000}} [[Runecraft]] experience}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Unlock details\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Music track\n|-\n|[[Jaws of the Basilisk]]\n|Unlocked during the basilisk invasion\n|[[File:Jaws of the Basilisk.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Lair of the Basilisk]]\n|Unlocked upon entering the Jormungand's prison\n|[[File:Lair of the Basilisk.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Fight of the Basilisk]]\n|Unlocked during the fight with Typhor\n|[[File:Fight of the Basilisk.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Reign of the Basilisk]]\n|Unlocked during the fight with the Jormungand\n|[[File:Reign of the Basilisk.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Ballad of the Basilisk (music track)|Ballad of the Basilisk]]\n|Unlocked during the final cutscene\n|[[File:Ballad of the Basilisk.ogg]]\n|}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 30 November 2022\n|update = The Garden of Death & More\n|poll = Future Quests & Combat Achievement Rewards\n|change = The following skill experience rewards have increased:\n*[[Slayer]] from 15,000 to 50,000\n*[[Crafting]] from 15,000 to 50,000.\n*[[Runecraft]] from 5,000 to 30,000.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*If the player interacts with their pet rock after having been exiled, the rock will ignore them, causing the player to say \"not you too! aw...\"\n*First pitched in early 2017, development on the quest was done in Mods Ed and Wolf's personal project time, with a large chunk of the quest being completed before personal projects were cancelled in mid-2018, halting development of the quest until August 2019.\n*This quest is loosely based off of {{wp|Norse mythology}}, where a giant sea serpent known as ''{{wp|Jörmungandr}}'' will commence {{wp|Ragnarök}}, the end of the world.\n*The name \"Dräpare\" that the player is given after the quest is Swedish for \"slayer\".\n*If players have two kegs of beer in their inventory before Brundt the Chieftain requests them, he will state that the player character is more of an alcoholic than he is.\n*The quest has multiple popular culture references:\n**During the conversation with Fossegrimen at the altar, she will say, \"''V?

You will likely only use one prayer potion killing the 10 trolls before the fight. It is recommended you bring and have a [[Neitiznot shield]] equipped before you begin and at all times to lower the max hit of Ranged trolls from 6 to 2, as repairing one of the bridges can be dangerous, and running to the eastern side of the northern-most island can be fatal without this. The quest is also relatively short if you gather all the items beforehand, and you'll likely only need 5-6 good [[food]] prior to the boss.\n\n===Area overview===\nThe Fremennik Isles are a collection of islands interconnected by bridges. The map below shows the islands and their interconnections. There are two major villages on the islands: [[Neitiznot]] and [[Jatizso]].\n\nThe teleport locations show the landing docks that can be reached from the most northern dock in [[Rellekka]] using the appropriate ferry operator.\n\nThe numbers on the map represent the following locations relevant during the quest:\n[[File:The Fremennik Isles quest map.png|frame|centre|Quest map]]\n#The court of [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]].\n#The court of [[Mawnis Burowgar|King Mawnis Burowgar]].\n#A bridge that needs repairs.\n#Another bridge that needs repairs.\n#Entrance to the [[Ice Troll Caves]] for the final battle.\nDo not go to the northern islands without [[food]], or you may die.\n\nBoth villages have a bank that can be used.\n\nAt any time during the quest, it is possible to travel around all islands.\n:'''Note:''' If you are simply starting this quest for access to Neitiznot bring a [[raw tuna]] and 8 [[tin ore]]s if [[Mining]] level 1, 7 pieces of [[coal]] if mining level 2-54, 6 [[mithril ore]]s if 55+ and speak to King Gjuki Sorvott IV.\n\n===King Gjuki Sorvott IV===\n{{Needed|[[raw tuna]], ores as above, [[catspeak amulet]] if you wish to hear what the cat is saying.}}\n[[File:The Fremennik Isles - Jatizso court.png|thumb|220px|King Sorvott's court]]\nTo start the quest, talk to [[Mord Gunnars]] at the most northern dock in [[Rellekka]] to be taken to [[Jatizso]].\n\nTalk to [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]] in the checkered floor room. His [[HRH Hrafn|cat]] will intervene. The king asks you to get the cat a [[raw tuna]].\n:'''Note:''' You can either fish the raw tuna on the south pier or buy it from [[Flosi Dalksson]] in the north-eastern house.\n\nGive the tuna to the king's cat, and talk to the king.\n\nGive the king the [[ores]] you are assigned (8 [[Tin ore|tin]] if 1, 7 pieces of [[coal]] if 2-54, 6 [[Mithril ore|mithril]] if 55+). If needed, these ores can be mined at [[Jatizso mine|the cave]] below the village. It is accessible by exiting the west gate and going north-east. Enter the dungeon, and mine the ores. Coal can also be bought from [[Hring Hring]]. The king's reward for the ores consists of some [[coins]].\n\n'''Take all 4 pieces of [[Silly jester costume|Jester]] clothes from the chest behind the king's throne.'''\n\nTravel back to Rellekka by talking to Mord Gunners on the dock to the south, and then travel to [[Neitiznot]] by talking to Mord's wife, [[Maria]], who stands next to where you land.\n\n===Burgher Mawnis Burowgar===\n{{Needed|[[Silly jester costume]]}}\n[[File:FI jester controls.png|thumb|300px|The player entertaining the Burgher.]]\n\nPut on all four pieces of the jester costume, unequip anything in your weapon and shield slots and talk to [[Slug Hemligssen]], behind the bank, and say, ''\"Free stuff please.\"''\n\n*If you have a follower out while attempting to do the Jester's Performance, you will be prompted to put your cat away regardless of the pet you have out \n\nTalk to [[Mawnis Burowgar]] in the building just south of the bank while wearing the jester costume and entertain him—do everything he says using the jester control panel shown in the picture. Keep an eye on the guards exchange:\n\n<blockquote style=\"margin: 0 2em; font-style: italic\">\nWhen do we assault the caves?<br/>\nIn '''two days'''.<br/>\nGood. How many recruits are ready?<br/>\n'''Seventeen''' so far.<br/>\nMore shields are completed by noon.<br/>\nAnd the armour?<br/>\nI will finish their armour by tomorrow.<br/>\nAnd the '''two bridges''' we need repaired.<br/>\nI will fix them as soon as I can.\n</blockquote>\n\nBack to Slug, and answer his questions. The answers are:\n#'''2 days'''\n#'''17 militia'''\n#'''2 bridges'''\nHead back to Mawnis Burowgar, without the jester costume this time.\n\n===Bridge repairs===\n{{Needed|8 [[rope]]s (can be obtained during this part), an [[axe]], 8 [[arctic pine logs]] or 8 [[split log]]s (can be obtained during this part), a [[knife]].\n|recommended=[[armour]] and [[food]].}}\n\nBring [[Mawnis Burowgar]] eight [[rope]]s. If you are missing ropes, go kill some [[yak]]s and take the [[hair]] drop to the [[spinning wheel]] in the village. You will keep the ropes and receive 1,000 [[coins]].\n\nHe will then ask you to get eight [[split log]]s. If you have 56 Woodcutting, go and cut eight [[arctic pine logs]] and split them on the [[woodcutting stump]] in the middle of the village. (If you do not have the Woodcutting level, you may buy the split logs from other players and still continue with the quest.) Bring them to Mawnis and receive another 1,500 coins.\n\nSpeak to the guard [[Thakkrad Sigmundson]], and you will be able to repair the bridges.\n:Be warned; you may be attacked by high-level, hard-hitting trolls in the next step. Bring [[food]]/[[armour]] if necessary.\n[[File:The Fremennik Isles reparing bridge.png|thumb|220px|Repairing the bridge.]]\nGet a [[knife]], eight [[split log]]s, and eight ropes from the bank (or buy the knife from the general supply [[NPC]] in the [[bank]]). Travel over the first set of bridges to get to the broken ones further north to repair the bridges (right-click). You will have to travel past trolls to get there, some of which can use [[Ranged]]. Each bridge only needs one repair, and level 20 Construction.\n\n'''Note''': If you wish to be safe, turn on [[Protect from Missiles]] ''before'' repairing the eastern bridge. [[Prayer]]s cannot be activated during the repair. All damage dealt to you will be applied at once after repairing the bridge, and can easily kill you at lower levels.\n\nGo back to talk to the king ([[Mawnis Burowgar]]) again; he'll pay another 1,500 coins for repairing the bridges. Now, the request is to investigate the [[Ice Troll Caves|troll caves]], but first, you need to make sure that the other [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV|king]] does not take the raid on the trolls in the wrong way.\n\n===Tax collector===\n{{Needed|5,000 [[coins]] (recommended)}}\n\nUse the boat to go back to [[Rellekka]], and use [[Mord]]'s ferry service to return to [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]] on [[Jatizso]].\n\nKing Gjuki Sorvott IV requires a tax collector for his new window tax, which needs to pay for the expenses of the army.\n\nCollect taxes from the following people:\n#[[Hring Hring]] or [[Raum Urda-Stein]] at the armourer's hut (8,000 [[coins]])\n#[[Skuli Myrka]] at the weaponsmith hut (6,000 [[coins]])\n#[[Flosi Dalksson]] or [[Keepa Kettilon]] at the fish shop/[[general store]] (5,000 [[coins]])\n#[[Vanligga Gastfrihet]] at the eating hall (5,000 [[coins]]) ''(Offer to pay her taxes for her; this provides the capability to trade in black market yak goods after the quest.)''\n'''Note:'''  You can speak to Magnus Gram (banker) about taxes, in which he'll politely make you change your mind about taxing him. \n\nGo back to King Sorvott, who now requires a tax collector for the newly invented \"facial hair tax.\"\n\nNow, collect from:\n#[[Raum Urda-Stein]] (armour trader)\n#Hring Hring (ore trader, in the same building as [[Raum Urda-Stein|Raum]])\n#Skuli Myrka (weapon trader at the anvil north of [[Raum Urda-Stein|Raum]])\n#Flosi Dalksson (raw fish seller in the general store)\n#[[Keepa Kettilon]] (cooked fish seller in the general store)\n'''Note:''' You can speak to [[Eric (Jatizso)|Eric]], who has no money and will throw a [[cabbage]] at you.\n\nThe tax bag now contains 29,000 coins. The same taxpayer options apply as in the previous tax collection round. Return to the king.\n\nThe taxes are finally enough. Now, the king requires more spying assistance. So, it's time to return to [[Slug Hemligssen|Slug]] the spymaster in [[Neitiznot]].\n\n'''Note:''' If you do not have a [[Neitiznot shield]] already and don't have a [[bronze nail]] in your bank, buy one [[Copper ore|copper]] and one [[tin ore]] from Hring Hring to make a [[bronze bar]] at the clay forge in Neitiznot (or use [[Superheat Item]]). When returning to Jatizso later in quest, use the anvil to make some bronze nails.\n\n===The jester part 2===\n{{Needed|[[Silly jester costume]]}}\n\nReturn to [[Slug Hemligssen|Slug]] once more, only to get an assignment as jester again.\n\nA rough capture of the guards exchange:\n<blockquote style=\"margin: 0 2em; font-style: italic\">\nWhat do you think of the new Burgher's Champion?<br/>\n[He/She]{{Clarify|Is this based on pronouns? If so, is there a line for they/them pronouns?}} seems honourable and courageous to me.<br/>\nWhat about their collaboration with King Sorvott?<br/>\nWell, I trust Mord Gunnars and he works for the King.<br/>\nAnd the '''Champion was helping''' you to repair the bridges.<br/>\nWell yes. So are your militia ready?<br/>\nI have them anchored near '''Etceteria'''.<br/>\nThen I shall sail our '''potions''' to them tonight.<br/>\nSo are we ready to sail at dawn?<br/>\nAbsolutely, long live Burgher Burowgar.<br/>\nAnd may the Troll general be short lived.<br/>\n</blockquote>\n\nNow, return to Slug and bring out a report. The answers are:\n#'''Etceteria'''\n#'''Some potions'''\n#'''I have been helping'''\nSlug is pleased with the answers and pays another 2,500 coins. Then, he suggests to visit [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]] and give an update on the spying progress.\n\n===Traditional Fremennik rites===\n{{Needed|A set of [[yak-hide armour]] '''OR''' 3 [[yak-hide]]s (can be obtained on [[Neitiznot]]), 15 [[coins]], a [[needle]] and two [[thread]]. You will also need a [[Neitiznot shield]] '''OR''' 2 [[arctic pine logs]], one [[bronze nail]], a [[hammer]], and a [[rope]].}}\n{{Listen\n|title = [[The Fremennik Kings]]\n|desc = The music which plays when the player berates King Gjuki Sorvott IV.\n|filename = The Fremennik Kings.ogg\n}}\n[[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]] gets an update that he is not prepared for, but he won't listen to sound advice.\n\n'''Note:''' You will need 1 free slot to receive the decree, in order to continue the quest, in this next dialogue with the king.\n\nHe will give you a Royal decree that you need to deliver to [[Mawnis Burowgar]].\n:'''Note:''' You will need to remove the Jester outfit to get the correct quest dialogue from Mawnis Burowgar.\n\nHop islands again to talk to Mawnis, who is obviously disappointed in learning the decree from King Sorvott. As leader of his troops, go through the ancient [[Neitiznot]] warrior rites.\n:'''Note:''' You can skip the making of the shield and armour by having all three items in your inventory and continuing to speak to the king.\n\nFirst, [[Thakkrad Sigmundson]] will tell you to make [[yak-hide armour]]. Get three [[yak-hide]]s, and have them cured by Thakkrad for a fee of 5 coins per hide. Take a [[needle]] and [[thread]] from bank or the nearby shop, and craft the [[cured yak-hide]]s into a [[yak-hide body]] (2 hides) and into [[yak-hide chaps]] (1 hide). Thakkrad states that the armour is ideal for protection from the [[Ice troll|trolls]]' granite clubs, however the armour does '''not''' have any such effect.\n\nTalk to King Burowgar again to learn how to make a large Fremennik round shield, the [[Neitiznot shield]]. This shield '''is''' ideal for protection from stones that are thrown by the trolls, reducing their max hit from 6 to 2.\n\nMaking the shield requires two [[arctic pine logs]], one [[bronze nail]], a [[hammer]], and a [[rope]]. Make the shield on the [[Woodcutting]] stump located east of bank. Make sure to have a hammer in the inventory.\n:'''Note:''' The shield is called '''Neitiznot shield''' on the woodcutting stump.\n:'''Note:''' If you do not have 56 Woodcutting to make this shield, you may buy the shield off other players, and it will still allow you to continue the quest.\n\nReturn to King Burowgar one more time, and he will make you the champion of Neitiznot and give you the assignment to kill the [[Ice Troll King]] and deliver his head.\n\n===The troll king===\n{{Needed|A [[Neitiznot shield]], [[food]], and [[armour]].\n|recommended=A means to teleport out of the cave after killing the Troll King.}}\n{{Instance}}\n:'''Note:''' The [[Troll King]] can only be killed effectively with [[Melee]]; '''do not use''' [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]].\n:'''Note:''' Do not use '''Protect from Melee''' against the troll king; he will use a strong knockback so long as you have it activated, rendering you unable to attack him and taking heavy damage. \nGo to the bank to stock up for battle. Take a melee weapon and armour, the [[Neitiznot shield]], and plenty of good food. Prayer potions should not be required as you will be able to obtain some for free in the cave. An emergency teleport and a [[ring of life]] are also useful.\n\nWhen ready, equip the Neitiznot shield and cross the eastern rope bridge, run north-east and cross the next rope bridge, then due north until you reach the sea, then straight east to the north-eastern [[Ice Troll Caves|cave]]. There is an unmarked dead-end entrance half way, do not try to go in, keep going.) \n\nThere are no trolls in the area directly outside the cave, so you can use this opportunity to rest and heal up.{{Listen\n|title = [[King of the Trolls]]\n|desc = The music which plays upon entering the Ice Troll Caves.\n|filename = King of the Trolls.ogg\n}}\n\nAfter entering the cave, a cutscene follows. You will have to kill 10 frenzied ice trolls (of any kind) in a somewhat chaotic [[multicombat area]], with help from the Fremennik [[Honour guard|Honour guards]], before you can cross the bridge to the south to assault the [[Ice Troll King]], which you fight one-on-one. The [[frenzied ice troll female]]s (the ones with blonde hair) use ranged attacks that hit fast and accurately, but the Neitiznot shield reduces their max hit to only 2. The [[Frenzied ice troll male|troll males]], [[Frenzied ice troll grunt|grunts]] and [[Frenzied ice troll runt|runts]] use Melee and have max hits of 17, 21 and 15 respectively.[[File:The Fremennik Isles honour guard and trolls.png|thumb|220px|Fighting the ice trolls alongside the honour guard.]]\nFirst, talk to [[Bork Sigmundson]] near the cave entrance - he will give you nine to ten [[tuna]]s, two to four 4-dose [[strength potion]]s, and two to four 3-dose prayer potions a single time each upon request. If there is not enough inventory space, then the player gets enough to fill their inventory and does not get any more. Players can make only one request for each supply. A good strategy would be to fight trolls until you've mostly used up your own food, then talk to Bork to resupply with tuna.\n\n[[File:The Fremennik Isles boss fight.png|thumb|220px|Fighting the Ice Troll King.]]\nIt is '''strongly''' recommended to position yourself at the edges of the battle, since going into the densest concentration of trolls can result in the player being attacked by 5 or more trolls at once and becoming overwhelmed. The safest strategy would be to use [[Protect from Melee]] whenever attacked by melee trolls as these do the greatest damage, and pick off trolls one by one. You can also target trolls that have been reduced to low health by the Fremenniks. If you don't have access to Protect from Melee, try to exclusively fight female trolls and avoid the males. Keep an eye on the trolls around you at all times so you don't get surrounded.\n\nOnce 10 trolls have been killed a message will appear in the chatbox stating that the bridge to the [[Ice Troll King]] can be used. Leaving the cave will not revoke your access to the Ice Troll King, so restock on supplies if you need to.\n\nWhen crossing the bridge, a short cut scene shows the Troll King moving towards you. He will land the first strike, so turn on the [[Protect from Magic]] prayer ('''not''' [[Protect from Melee]]) before crossing bridge or while the cut scene is playing, and top up prayer if needed.\n\nThe Troll King has a [[Combat level]] of 122 and uses a powerful mix of attacks (Melee, Ranged, [[Magic]] and teleport); turn on Protect from Magic and you won't get hit much. Using a [[Neitiznot shield]] as well will leave melee as his only effective attack, decreasing damage significantly. '''Do not use Protect from Melee against the troll king for he will use a strong knockback attack for as long as you have it activated, making you unable to attack him.''' Bring high healing food and a few doses of prayer potion. It is possible to kill him with Ranged or Magic, however it will be slow, only do this if you cannot use Melee effectively.\n[[File:The Fremennik Isles boss defeated.png|thumb|220px|Neitiznot's champion claims the troll's head as proof of victory.]]\nAfter killing the Troll King, decapitate the head from the body. (You do not need any particular weapon/[[knife]] for this step, you simply pull it off). If you die with the troll king head in your inventory, you do not need to kill the king again; just return to the spot to find the troll king with a new head for you to take.\n\nDo not take the east bridge after defeating the Troll King if you are low level. It is full of powerful trolls with no Fremennik NPCs to soak up hits.\n\nTeleport away, or return the way you came. Return to [[Neitiznot]] to talk to Burowgar. He will give his [[helm of neitiznot]] in return for the [[Troll King's head]]. After taking two choices for a 10,000 experience reward to any one of [[Attack]], [[Strength]], [[Defence]], or [[Hitpoints]] (you may choose the same skill twice), the quest is complete.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Fremennik Isles\n|image = [[File:The Fremennik Isles reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Construction|5,000}} [[Construction]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Crafting|5,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*{{SCP|Woodcutting|10,000}} [[Woodcutting]] experience\n*Two lots of {{SCP|Combat|10,000}} [[Combat]] experience (choose between {{SCP|Strength}} [[Strength]], {{SCP|Attack}} [[Attack]], {{SCP|Defence}} [[Defence]] or {{SCP|Hitpoints}} [[Hitpoints]]).\n*A [[Fremennik]] royal helm known as the [[helm of Neitiznot]], which is the equivalent of a [[berserker helm]] with a +3 [[Prayer bonus]], slightly better [[Magic]] and crush [[Defence]], and no negative bonuses. If a player loses the helm, they can talk to [[Mawnis Burowgar]] to buy another one for 50,000 [[coins]].\n*Access to [[arctic pine]] trees.\n*Access to an island with a [[runite rock]] north-east of [[Neitiznot]], which also has seven (7) [[coal rocks]] nearby.\n*Access to the [[Jatizso]] [[Jatizso mine|mine]], which contains up to [[adamantite rocks]].\n*Around 20,000 coins in assorted rewards during quest.\n*The banks in Neitiznot and Jatizso are close to [[water]], [[range]], [[furnace]], [[fishing spots]], [[mining]] [[ores]]; a [[spinning wheel]] is also nearby.\n*If the [[jester outfit]] is lost, a player can retrieve another one from the chest behind [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]]'s throne.\n*Learn the ability to create [[yak-hide armour]] and [[Neitiznot shield]]s.\n*The [[Contraband Yak Produce]] shop is available on Jatizso if a player refunds the 5,000 coin tax to [[Vanligga Gastfrihet]], who is north of the king.\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Ice Troll King]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of The Fremennik Isles is required for the following:\n*[[The Fremennik Exiles]]\n*Hard [[Fremennik diary]] (partial completion required)\n*Elite [[Fremennik diary]] (partial completion required)\n\n==Music==\n*[[The Fremennik Kings]]\n*[[Island of the Trolls]]\n*[[Jester Minute]]\n*[[King of the Trolls]]\n*[[Major Miner]]\n*[[Norse Code]]\n*[[Ogre the Top]]\n*[[Volcanic Vikings]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*If you attempt to tax the tramp [[Eric (Jatizso)|Eric]], he will throw a [[cabbage]] at you. The cabbage is added to your inventory.\n*The taxes that [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]] imposes are based on some real historical taxes.\n**The {{Wp|window tax}} was also a British glass tax during 1696-1851.\n**The {{Wp|beard tax}} of 1698 is the best known of a series of measures enacted by Tsar {{Wp|Peter the Great}} to transform and regulate the appearance of his subjects.\n*The exchange with [[Slug Hemligssen|Slug]] regarding your codename is a reference to the film ''{{Wp|Reservoir Dogs}}''.\n*The choice of password to give to [[Slug Hemligssen|Slug]], ''{{Wp|Colorless green ideas sleep furiously}}'', is a reference to a sentence devised by linguist Noam Chomsky.\n**The password \"free stuff please\" used to talk with Slug Hemligssen is a phrase commonly used by players who beg for items.\n*The watchtowers between the two islands have a special [[cutscene]] when spoken to, in which they are yelling insults to each other which are quotes from ''{{Wp|Monty Python and the Holy Grail}}'', such as \"Your mother was a hamster. ... And your father smelled of elderberries.\"\n**Same insult was also used in [[Eagles' Peak]] quest.\n*If a [[catspeak amulet]] is worn, or the player has completed [[Dragon Slayer II]], the player is able to understand what [[HRH Hrafn]] is saying during an early cutscene.\n*If you already have enough ores in your bank when tasked with acquiring them early in the quest, you will have a unique exchange with [[Thorkel Silkbeard]].\n*Speaking to Mawnis Burowgar with at least 8 ropes in your inventory, before he tells you that you need to get ropes to repair the bridges will result in a humorous conversation in which he accuses you of being a witch while you defend that you are a ropes salesperson.\n*When the quest was first released, one of the NPCs used the word ''damn'', which was originally a censored word when used by players. It was later changed to ''blasted''.\n*The names of the two villages sound similar to \"yeah, it is so,\" and \"no, it is not,\" which reflects their history of disagreement. \n*If the player tries to tax the banker teller, the bank teller will tell the player that he will start taxing him/her 10gp per transaction, plus back taxes. They come to an agreement not to tax him and the bank teller states he won't implement his taxes.\n*If you tell Mord Gunnars in the beginning of the quest that you're \"too busy to help the king\", he actually says \"bye\" in-game (overhead).\n*During the quest, King Gjuki Sorvott IV claims that Mawnis Burowgar is only attacking the trolls so that he can take the glory for killing the Troll King, and says that he will send his troops to the northwestern cave to beat him to it. However, the Neitiznot militia is attacking the northeastern cave. If the player goes to the northwestern cave during the quest, they will get the message \"Just inside the cave mouth lays the body of one of Jatizso's guards. Maybe I should enter the caves to the east, so I can find Neitiznot's militia.\"\n\n{{The Fremennik Isles}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Fremennik Isles, The}}"

The first thing you need is a lyre.\n\nThere are two ways to get a [[lyre]]:\n\n*'''Option 1:'''\n\n'''Note: You MUST start the trial by speaking with [[Olaf the Bard]] BEFORE speaking with [[Lalli]] or else he will not tell you about the other human.'''\n\n[[File:The Fremennik Trials - Swaying tree.png|thumb|230px|Cutting the Swaying tree.]]\n\nMake a lyre yourself. First, grab a [[potato]], [[cabbage]], and [[onion]] from the vegetable patch in [[Rellekka]] before you leave. Once you leave the gates, head east until you find a [[Swaying tree]], and cut a branch off it. Then use a knife on the branch. If you forgot to bring a knife, there is a knife spawn a few tiles north of the mining area in Rellekka. You will need an axe (blessed will not work) and a [[Woodcutting]] level of 40 in order to cut the tree, and a Crafting level of 40 to make the unfinished lyre.\n\nYou will then need to string the unfinished lyre, but unfortunately only golden wool will work. Head south-east of the tree until you find several golden sheep and a golden tree. Near them will be a troll called [[Lalli]], who will initially think you want the apples when you want the wool. He will tell you that he already gave it to another human, so go find him.\n\nThe other human is [[Askeladden]], who is the child located at the entrance of the long hall in Rellekka. Talk to him and he will give you a [[pet rock]] which he fooled Lalli with. Return to Lalli with the rock, but he will refuse it because the rocks might have baby rocks, so tell him that you can make a delicious rock soup with it.\n\n{{Map|mtype=pin|align=left|caption=Lalli's located at the Golden tree; Fossegrimen will enchant your finished lyre at the Strange altar.\n|2626,3598,desc:The location of the [[Strange altar]].\n|2741,3638,desc:The location of the [[swaying tree]].\n|2766,3608,desc:The location of the [[Golden tree]].\n}}\n\n{{Map|2675,3665|align=right|mtype=square|r=3|caption=Lanzig's location.}}\n'''<u>Use</u>''' the potato, cabbage, onion, and pet rock on Lalli's stew, which is just outside Lalli's cave home. Ask Lalli to taste it; he will like it and give you some golden fleece. The fleece will need to be strung into a ball of wool; even though there is a [[spinning wheel]] in Rellekka, you cannot use that until the quest is finished, so you will need to go to Seers' Village instead. Use the ball of wool on the unfinished lyre, which will require 25 Fletching.\n\n'''Note:''' If you plan to create multiple lyres, use the [[drop trick]] to collect multiple fleece before proceeding. Once Olaf the Bard's trial is complete, you will not be able to get more fleece from Lalli until the entire Fremennik Trials quest is complete, and Lalli will then charge you 1,000 coins per fleece.\n\n'''Option 2:''' Kill [[Lanzig]], [[Borrokar]], [[Lensa]] or [[Freidir]] in and around the buildings on the eastern side of Rellekka until they drop the lyre, each have a 1/17 chance to drop it. They all have a very quick respawn time and are located a short distance from each other. For mage and range users, you can use the fires in the centre of the buildings to [[safespot]].\n\n[[File:The_Fremennik_Trials_-_An_enchanted_performance.png|thumb|209x209px|A player performs with their lyre.]]\n\nOnce you've obtained the lyre, you need to get it enchanted. Bring a [[raw shark]], [[raw manta ray]], or [[raw sea turtle]] with you (if you have more than one lyre to enchant, then bring '''one fish for each lyre''' you wish to have enchanted; if using raw sharks, try to get raw sharks from Rufus' Meat Emporium in Canifis over a period of time). South-west of Rellekka is a strange altar located on a small peninsula. With the lyre in your inventory, use your raw shark/manta ray/sea turtle on the strange altar. A spirit named [[Fossegrimen]] will appear and enchant your lyre for you.\n\nEnter the door the Longhall Bouncer is guarding to go onstage. ('''Note:''' Drop any extra enchanted lyres, or they will become unenchanted). Play your lyre in front of the crowd, then talk to Olaf a final time to get his vote.\n\n<div align=\"right\">[[The Fremennik Trials#Walkthrough|(Return to Trials Map)]]</div>\n\n===Sigli the Huntsman===\n{{Needed|recommended=Some [[food]], [[armour]], a [[weapon]] (a halberd is best, Ranged is not effective), and [[prayer potion]]s.}}\n[[File:The Fremennik Trials - Fighting the Draugen.png|thumb|250x250px|A player fights the Draugen.]]\nSigli can be found near the entrance gate.\nYour task is to find the [[Draugen]], an immortal spirit, and defeat it to weaken it. Keep using the [[hunters' talisman]] that he gives you to find where to go. The talisman is used the same way you might use a [[Runecraft]] [[talisman]]; selecting locate gives a chat message in the direction to go. The Draugen moves around the [[Fremennik Province]] and can cross bridges. There is a small, transparent looking butterfly that follows the Draugen. It can be used to help locate him. Use the talisman on the exact tile that the Draugen is on to fight him. Level 48 [[Agility]] can help by allowing you access to the [[log balance (Fremennik Province)|log balance]] shortcut, as the Draugen has a random location that changes frequently. One slow method to find the [[Draugen]] is to sit near the bridge to the east of the strange altar and camp in a spot. Eventually, the Draugen will appear, announced by a chat message, \"The Draugen is here! Beware!\" With the proper [[Equipment|gear]], a level-50 player should defeat him without problems. However, it should be noted that the Draugen is particularly resistant to ranged attacks. When you defeat him, the Draugen's essence will be absorbed into the [[hunters' talisman]]. Return with the talisman to [[Sigli the Huntsman|Sigli]] to get his vote.\n\n<div align=\"right\">[[The Fremennik Trials#Walkthrough|(Return to Trials Map)]]</div>\n\n===Sigmund the Merchant===\n{{Needed|5,000 [[coins]].}}\n\nYou can find [[Sigmund the Merchant (shop)|Sigmund]] in the market. He will want you to get him an [[exotic flower]]. This may sound easy, but you will end up having to get something or do something for another person, kind of like a miniature [[One Small Favour]] quest. Refer to [[The Fremennik Trials#Walkthrough|the map above]] to easily locate the [[NPC]]s.\n\n#First, talk to the Sailor on the dock (second pier from the left) about the flower. Ask him about the Merchant's Trial. He will want a romantic [[Fremennik ballad|ballad]] composed for him. \n#Talk to [[Olaf the Bard]]. He will ask you to get him a pair of [[Sturdy boots|new boots]].\n#Go to the clothing store (aside: the clothing store is also the starting point of the Rellekka agility course on this building, so in your minimap, you can see the Agility icon) which can be found west of Sigmund and ask [[Yrsa]] about them. She will agree to make the boots only if [[Brundt the Chieftain]] will lower the taxes on the stores.\n#If you talk to Brundt in the longhall, he will tell you that the clan will be able to afford it if [[Sigli the Huntsman]] will show him the best places to hunt monsters.\n#Talk to Sigli just south of the longhall. He agrees but first will want a [[Custom bow string|custom-made bowstring]].\n#Go to the helmet store just north of the longhall. The shopkeeper, [[Skulgrimen]], will give you the bowstring in exchange for the [[Unusual fish|rare fish]] that the fisherman caught.\n#Head to the dock located west of the helmet shop ([[Torfinn]] is on this dock) and talk to the fisherman on the northern end of the dock. He will ask you to get a [[Sea fishing map|map]] of the best spots to catch edible fish.\n#Find [[Swensen the Navigator]], who is located in the building south of the marketplace. He will make the map but he will want a [[weather forecast]] first.\n#[[Peer the Seer]] is found just north-west of Swensen. He will give you a forecast if [[Thorvald the Warrior]] will agree to be his bodyguard.\n#[[Thorvald the Warrior]] is found in the helmet store. He wants you to get him a seat in the longhall.\n#[[Manni the Reveller]] is found in the longhall. He will gladly give up his seat if [[Thora the Barkeep]] will make him one of her [[legendary cocktail]]s.\n#Thora, also in the longhall, will only agree to make one if you can get a signed note from [[Askeladden]] for him to stay out of the bar.\n#Talk to Askeladden, just south of the longhall, to get the note for 5000 [[coins]].\n#Then, give the note to Thora, the cocktail to Manni, the [[Champions token|token]] to Thorvald, the [[Warriors' contract|contract]] to Peer, the forecast to Swensen, the chart to the fisherman, the fish to Skulgrimen, the string to Sigli, the [[Tracking map|map]] to Brundt, the [[Fiscal statement|slip]] to Yrsa, the boots to Olaf, the ballad to the sailor (the second dock from the left in Rellekka), and finally the flower to Sigmund. You will get his vote.\n\n<div align=\"right\">[[The Fremennik Trials#Walkthrough|(Return to Trials Map)]]</div>\n\n===Swensen the Navigator===\nTalk to [[Swensen the Navigator|Swensen]] in his house, south-west of the longhall. Your task is to navigate your way through his maze of portals. Enter the maze by going down the ladder in the south-west of his house. In each room of the maze, there are four portals: One on the north wall, one on the south wall, one on the east wall, and one on the west wall. In the brighter rooms with burning torches, one of the portals will take you to the next room on the correct path. The other three will send you to a dim room, with extinguished torches, spider webs, and skeletons. The darker rooms are dead ends, their portals only lead to other dead ends, you must climb the rope and start over.\n\nThe trick is to spell his name. First, go in the '''S'''outh portal, then the '''W'''est, then '''E'''ast, then '''N'''orth, then '''S'''outh, then '''E'''ast, and finally '''N'''orth again ''(SWENSEN)''. After you finish, talk to Swensen to get his vote (make sure to put your minimap focused with the north on the right spot).\n\n<div align=\"right\">[[The Fremennik Trials#Walkthrough|(Return to Trials Map)]]</div>\n\n===Thorvald the Warrior===\n{{Needed|None|recommended=[[Food]], [[prayer potion]]s, and combat potions. If you have low combat stats you may bring a [[god book]], [[rings of recoil]] (7 minimum), [[goblin paint cannon]], [[phoenix necklace]]s, a [[dramen branch]] and knife.}}\n\n*Note for [[Ultimate Ironman|Ultimate Ironmen]]: Looting bags are not allowed in this fight, regardless of their contents.\n*Note for ''Hardcore Group Ironmen'': '''If you die to the 4th phase in the fight, this is a SAFE DEATH.''' You do not actually die, the fight ends if you get to 1 health.\n\n[[Thorvald]] lives in the helmet store. His task is for you to fight a special warrior called [[Koschei the deathless]]. There are two rules: \n\n#You must fight and defeat him 3 times. Every time he is defeated, he regains his health back and becomes much stronger. '''You only need to defeat Koschei for the first 3 rounds; if you die to him on the 4th round, you will pass Thorvald's trial. ''Hardcore ironmen and hardcore group ironmen only need to be concerned about dying to the first 3 forms. Losing to his fourth form will not actually kill the player; a small cut-scene ends the fight when you are about to lose to the fourth form.'''''\n#You cannot use any [[weapons]] or [[armour]] or bring [[runes]]. The Ardougne cloak counts as armour but the boots of lightness do not. However, you can use [[food]], [[Prayer]], [[god book]]s and jewellery (excluding those that give combat bonuses, such as [[combat bracelet]]). H.A.M gear is suitable for combat with Koschei as that counts as clothing but still giving some combat defence. [[Ring of recoil|Rings of recoil]] or the [[ring of suffering (ri)]] are strongly recommended. A [[Dramen branch]] and a knife can be used to create a [[Dramen staff]], or  a [[Celastrus bark]] and a knife can be used to create a [[Battlestaff]].\n\nThere are also some things to note:\n*You are given the option to send your items to the bank before entering the basement. Talk to the [[Peer the Seer]] to do so. Note that '''all''' of your items, both equipped and in your inventory, will be banked if you have any equipment that you are not allowed to take in with you. However, you can drop your items on the ground before asking Peer the Seer to deposit your items, keeping them for the battle. CLUE scrolls count as armour.\n*You can't bring [[arrowtips]] or [[Unstrung bow|unstrung bows]] and thus cannot fletch any equipment in the arena like you can on [[Entrana]].\n*It is possible to flinch Koschei but not recommended due to the fact if you take too long to kill he will despawn and you will have to restart.\n*Do not wear a [[ring of life]] as you will be teleported all the way back to your spawn point.\n*Reward caskets and/or mystery boxes may also be brought into the arena for their armour and weapon drops.\n*It is possible to glitch the fight if you die, and you come back quick enough it is possible to keep fighting him from the point at which you died, and ignore the second Koschei that pops up.\n*The time limit for the third form is 10 minutes. If you are unable to beat Koschei's third form in this time, he will despawn, and you will have to reset.\n\nStock up on the food and potions, then proceed to head down to Thorvald's basement. When you enter the arena, Koschei is hidden. Simply roam around for a short while, and he will appear.\n[[File:The_Fremennik_Trials_-_Fighting_Koschei_the_deathless.png|thumb|Koschei's final form.]]\nKoschei's first form is easy and should give you no problems. After you defeat him, he will regain all of his health and become stronger. There is no way to safespot him as you have no weapons, but you can trap him over the hole and wait a while for your health to regenerate. However, if you stay there too long, he will disappear and reappear after you run around, back in his first form. His level is not displayed.\n\nHis second form might give you a bit of trouble, and you might need to use food or Prayer.\n\nHis third form is fairly difficult, so you will most likely need to use food and/or Prayer here. You may need a [[prayer potion]] here as it is possible to run out of prayer points early. This is the last form required for you to defeat to complete the quest.\n\n'''Note:''' Leaving after the 3rd fight resets your progress. Enter the 4th fight regardless and, should you lose, his fourth form may roam the area when you return).\n\nThe fourth form is the hardest. He will hit once every game tick, but can only hit for 1 damage at a time. It is recommended that the player use a [[Ring of recoil]], but be sure to bring enough rings for the fight (7 minimum) as the ring breaks after 40 hitpoints of damage, and Koschei has 255 HP in this form. Some high level food will also be required to heal the damage taken using this method. In this form, Koschei will quickly drop your prayer points in intervals of 1-2 every second and will drop all of your prayer points as soon as the form starts. If you manage to beat Koschei in this form, you will be given a [[Fremennik blade]]. Otherwise, when Koschei leaves you at 1 hitpoint, you will kneel on the ground and find yourself upstairs. Regardless, Thorvald will give you his vote for your bravery in fighting a superior foe.\n\n<div align=\"right\">[[The Fremennik Trials#Walkthrough|(Return to Trials Map)]]</div>\n\n===Peer the Seer===\n[[Peer the Seer|Peer]] is found south of the market. He'll give you his vote if you can simply enter the front door to his house, and then come out the other side. This is more difficult than it seems because you cannot take any items in, and you will encounter many puzzles inside. '''You can deposit all your items by completing the dialogue after Peer introduces his trial.'''\n\n'''Note:''' Because Peer will bank all of your items in your inventory, this should be done last to save a lot of time walking to and from the bank.\n\n====Entering the house====\nTo get in, you need to answer a puzzle. The answer is a four-letter word, and Peer will give you a clue for each letter and the word itself. All possible answers include: time, life, mage, fire, wind, mind, and tree.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Riddle\n!Answer\n|-\n|\n*My first is in mage, but not in wizard.\n*My second in goblin, and also in lizard.\n*My third in night, but not in the day.\n*My last is in fields, but not in the hay.\n*My whole is the most powerful tool you will possess.\n|Mind\n|-\n|\n*My first is in tar, but not in a swamp.\n*My second in fire, but not in a camp.\n*My third is in eagle, but never in air.\n*My last is in hate, but also in care.\n*My whole wears more rings the older I get.\n|Tree\n|-\n|\n*My first is in the well, but not at sea.\n*My second in 'I', but not in 'me'.\n*My third in flies, but insects not found.\n*My last is in earth, but not in the ground.\n*My whole when stolen from you causes you death.\n|Life\n|-\n|\n*My first is in fish, but not in the sea.\n*My second in birds, but not in a tree.\n*My third is in doors, but not in a hall.\n*My last is everything, but nothing at all.\n*My whole cannot die as long as it has food.\n|Fire\n|-\n|\n*My first is in water, and also in tea.\n*My second is in fish, but not in the sea.\n*My third is in mountains, but not underground.\n*My last is in strike, but not like in pound.\n*My whole crushes mountains, drains rivers, and destroys civilisations.

To open it, you must set exactly four litres of water on it.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, you will need some items found in the room; search and study everything until you find an [[old red disk]], a [[wooden disk]], a [[red herring]], an [[empty jug]], and an [[empty bucket]].\n\nOnce you have all of the items, you can solve the puzzle by doing the following:\n\n#Fill up the bucket from the tap south of the cooking range.\n#Use the [[full bucket]] on the jug to end up with a [[2/5ths full bucket]].\n#Empty the [[full jug]] by using it on the drain.\n#Use the bucket on the jug to get a [[2/3rds full jug]].\n#Fill up the bucket with the tap again, and then use the bucket on the jug to get a [[4/5ths full bucket]].\n#Use the bucket on the locked chest to get the [[vase]].\n#Use the [[red herring]] on the cooking range to receive [[sticky red goop]].\n#Use the sticky red goop on the wooden disk so you have 2 [[red disk]]s.\n#Go down the east ladder and use both red disks on the [[abstract mural]] to receive the [[vase lid]].\n#Use the full jug on the vase to get a [[vase of water]].\n#Use the vase lid on the vase, creating a [[sealed vase]].\n#Use the sealed vase on the [[frozen table]] to get a [[Frozen key (The Fremennik Trials)|frozen key]]. (frozen table is back up the ladder)\n#Unfreeze the key by cooking it on the range.\n#Go down the east ladder (Note: '''Use the east ladder nearest to the frozen table. If you exit using the other door, you will have to do some parts over again.''') and out the exit to get Peer's vote.\n\nOnce you have all seven council members' votes, head back to [[Chieftain Brundt]], and speak to him to complete the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=The Fremennik Trials|image=[[File:The Fremennik Trials reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=3|rewards=*{{SCP|Agility|2,812.4}} [[Agility]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Attack|2,812.4}} [[Attack]] experience\n*{{SCP|Crafting|2,812.4}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*{{SCP|Defence|2,812.4}} [[Defence]] experience\n*{{SCP|Fishing|2,812.4}} [[Fishing]] experience\n*{{SCP|Fletching|2,812.4}} [[Fletching]] experience\n*{{SCP|Hitpoints|2,812.4}} [[Hitpoints]] experience\n*{{SCP|Strength|2,812.4}} [[Strength]] experience\n*{{SCP|Thieving|2,812.4}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{SCP|Woodcutting|2,812.4}} [[Woodcutting]] experience\n*Access to the islands of [[Miscellania]], [[Etceteria]], [[Neitiznot]], and [[Jatizso]] along with access to the facilities in Rellekka.\n*Ability to wear the [[Fremennik]] [[Warrior helm|warrior]], [[Berserker helm|berserker]], [[Archer helm|archer]], and [[Farseer helm|farseer]] helms\n*Ability to have [[Fossegrimen]] create the [[enchanted lyre(i)]]\n*A [[herring]]}}\n*[[Jarvald]] will charge no fee for travelling to [[Waterbirth Island]]\n*A [[Fremennik name]] as part of becoming a [[titles|clansman]] in the Fremennilk\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of The Fremennik Trials is required for the following:\n*[[The Fremennik Isles]]\n*[[Throne of Miscellania]]\n*[[Olaf's Quest]]\n*[[Lunar Diplomacy]]\n*[[Rag and Bone Man II]] (completion of [[Horror from the Deep]] may be used instead)\n*All tiers of the [[Fremennik Diary]]\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 6 February 2014\n|update = Quick-prayers & Loot Broadcast\n|change = After [[Koschei the Deathless]] drained your prayer in Fremennik Trials, players could simply restore it and re-activate their prayers.

The rock will seem much happier after these interactions.\n*During Peer the Seer's Trial, examining the unicorn head upstairs gives the examine text \"Alas poor unicorn, I knew him well\", a reference to Prince Hamlet's famous quotation \"Alas, poor [[Wikipedia:Yorick|Yorick]]! I knew him, Horatio.\" in Shakespeare's ''{{wp|Hamlet|The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark}}''.\n*The \"Rock Soup\" portion of the quest is a reference to an old folk tale, often called \"{{wp|Stone Soup}}\", where hungry travellers use a stone in a boiling pot of water to get local villagers to share in making the soup. Stone soup is still made today; placing a stone in soup adds a stony flavour.\n*During the Seer's trial, the puzzle items include a red herring. A red herring is a term used to refer to a misleading and usually useless key in a puzzle. During this trial, however, the literal red herring is used to complete the trial, and the magnet, which seems useful, is in fact the red herring.\n*The name \"Koschei the Deathless\" is a reference to the character of the same name found in Russian folklore.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Fremennik Trials}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Fremennik Trials, The}}"

Fairy ring {{fairycode|BLS}} is the closest teleport.\n\nAlternatively, players can head to the [[Shayziens' Wall]] and make their way south-west, or start from [[Mount Quidamortem]] and head south-east – in these cases, be wary of aggressive [[lizardmen]] and [[lizardmen brute]]s or [[mountain troll]]s.\n\nSearch the [[Tent (The Garden of Death)|tent]] to start the quest and receive [[Kasonde's journal]]. Read the journal, discovering about the [[Old Ones]], who were once an ancient race that inhabited what is today the Kingdom of [[Varlamore]], and suggests lizardmen architecture was derived from theirs. Search the [[Camping Equipment (The Garden of Death)|camping equipment]] for some [[secateurs]] if you don't already have some, and climb down the nearby [[Hole_(The_Garden_of_Death)|hole]].\n\n===A swampy dungeon===\n[[File:The Garden of Death - campsite dungeon searchable objects.png|thumb|350px|The locations of searchable objects in the dungeon south-east of Mount Quidamortem. Search the table labelled \"1\" to receive the stone tablet.]]\nYou will arrive in a dungeon with lizardmen architecture and a set of farming patches. Look around the stone tables until you see one with a \"Search\" option. This will give you your first [[Stone tablet (The Garden of Death)|stone tablet]]. Read it to discover that it is written in an ancient unknown language. Upon closing the interface, you will receive a set of incomplete [[word translations]] which you must uncover further in the quest.\n\nThe other stone tables should now have \"Search\" options; do so to receive two [[wood carving]]s. Inspect these to view detailed illustrations and words corresponding with them. One of the vases can be searched to receive a [[dirty note]]; this gives the players a hint on how to translate the carvings. Next, search the stone chest at the eastern end to learn the phrase 'Miki Toka'.\n\nOnce you believe you've figured out the meaning of the words, read the [[word translations]] again and click \"Attempt Translation\"; you will be prompted to enter a word's translation. Input the following words:\n* Island = Ikam\n* Lake/Pond/Water = Ates\n* Time/Death = Miki\n* Vessel/Container/Holder = Toka\n* Garden/Plant/Tree/Forest/Wood = Tlane\n* North = Makt\n\nAs you translate the words, the stone tablet you read earlier will automatically translate the words you know of. You will be directed to somewhere north under an island. The only large island that currently can be travelled to is the one on [[Lake Molch]]. If you don't have a pair of [[secateurs]] on you, climb back up and search the camping equipment for one before leaving, as you'll need it for the next part.\n\nPlayers can quickly get there by using [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|DJR}} and running south-west to the northern dock. From the dock, board the [[boaty]] to [[Molch Island]]. Alternatively, you can teleport to [[Shayzien]] via [[Kharedst's memoirs]] and run north-west to the east dock near the [[Giant Pit]].\n\n===Lake Molch Island===\n[[File:The Garden of Death - Lake Molch Island searchable objects.png|thumb|350px|The locations of searchable objects in the dungeon beneath Lake Molch Island. Search the table labelled \"1\" to receive the stone tablet.]]\n{{Needed|[[Secateurs]] or [[Magic secateurs]]}}\nUpon arriving at Molch Island, climb down the hole behind the hut to arrive at a similarly looking dungeon. Inspect the [[Vines (The Garden of Death)|vines]] for another dirty note, which suggests that [[Kasonde Shaw]] returned to his camp as you left.\n\nCut the vines and squeeze through them, and once again look around the stone tables for one with a \"Search\" option. This will give you your second [[Stone tablet (The Garden of Death)|stone tablet]]. Read it, and the other stone table behind you should now have a \"Search\" option, which will give you your third [[wood carving]]. On the eastern side of the room, search the vase for your fourth wood carving, as well as the other vase for the phrase 'Tlane Kualt' and the chest for the phrase 'Olkat'. Lastly, search the rubble by the farming patches below the platform for your fifth wood carving.\n\nAfter inspecting the carvings, input the following words into the word translations:\n* West = Silam\n* Poison = Achi\n* Animal/Creature = Ayak\n* Body = Olkat\n* Food/Eat/Feed = Kualt\n* Earth/Land/Ground = Xali\n* Air/Wind = Ehke\n* Fire/Destroy/Break = Tepat\n\nOnce these words are translated, you will be prompted to read the stone tablet for your next steps. You will be directed somewhere west of the lake. Leave the dungeon, and board the boaty to travel to [[Molch]]. Upon arrival, make your way south-west to [[Xeric's Shrine]].\n\n===Xeric's Shrine===\n[[File:The Garden of Death - Xeric's Shrine searchable objects.png|thumb|350px|The locations of searchable objects in the dungeon beneath Kebos Swamp. Search the table labelled \"1\" to receive the stone tablet.]]\nUpon arriving at Xeric's Shrine, climb down the hole at the eastern side of the shrine to arrive in the third dungeon. Search the south-eastern stone table for your third stone tablet, then search the open stone chest adjacent to it for a [[Compass (The Garden of Death)|compass]]. Inspect it to discover the word equivalents for the cardinal directions.\n\nNext, search the vase just north, the other two stone tables, and the huge mushroom in the centre for the next four wood carvings. After inspecting the carvings, input the following words into the word translations:\n* Build/Create/Make = Chua\n* Yes/Success/Right/Correct = Kemo\n* No/Failure/Wrong/Incorrect = Ami\n* Move/Transfer/Deliver/Send = Lini\n* Arrive/Here = Xita\n* East = Takam\n* South = Uitt\n\nOnce these words are translated, you will be prompted to read the stone tablet for your next steps. You will be directed to a structure somewhere in a forest south-east. The final location is the [[Ruins of Morra]]; players can leave the dungeon, board the boaty to travel to [[Shayzien]], and run south-east past the [[Shayziens' Wall]]. Alternatively, players can leave the dungeon and teleport to [[Shayzien]] via [[Kharedst's memoirs]] and run southwards.\n\n===Ruins of Morra===\n[[File:The Garden of Death - Ruins of Morra searchable objects.png|thumb|350px|The locations of searchable objects in the dungeon beneath the Ruins of Morra. Search the table labelled \"1\" to receive the stone tablet.]]\nThe last hole to enter is found in front of the large step pyramid in the [[Ruins of Morra]]. Search the southern stone table for the final stone tablet, and search the other stone tables, vase, stone chest, and rubble for the remaining wood carvings and dirty note.\n\nAfter inspecting the carvings, input the following words into the word translations:\n* Small/Few/Little = Amok\n* Big/Many/Plenty/Lots = Siua\n* Light/Sun = Ralo\n* Dark/Moon = Rani\n* Life/Soul = Tal\n* Death/Time/Die/Kill = Miki\n* Knowledge/Mind = Yoka\n* Home = Antil\n\nOnce these words are translated, you will be prompted to read the stone tablet and to take a [[warning note]] that you spotted on the floor.\n\nRead it to discover that [[Kasonde Shaw]] was several steps ahead of you and that you must have come to the same conclusion: that the Old Ones were the first ones to perform soul transference, rather than the [[Citizens of Arceuus]].\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Garden of Death\n|image = [[File:The Garden of Death reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*{{SCP|Farming|10,000|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\n* [[Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 7 December 2022\n|update = Quest Speedrunning: Batch 3 & More\n|change = \n* Players are now prompted whether they want to attempt another translation after inputting a correct one.\n* Inputting a translation for a word the player hasn't discovered yet in-game now results in a different message.\n* Reading the stone tablet is now clearer; blue translated words now indicate words in incorrect context, whilst new, green translated words indicate the word is correct in context.\n* Players can no longer teleport within the dungeons; attempting to do so results in the game message \"''An ancient magical force blocks your teleport.''\"\n* The [[dragonkin]] symbols have been removed from the stone chests in the dungeons.\n* The dirty notes, wood carvings, and compass now have a \"Drop\" option instead of \"Destroy\".\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Pre-release gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\n2022 Game Jam - The Garden of Death - Translation.png|A teaser image from Mod Ed's Twitter account during the [[April 2022 Game Jam]].\nThe Garden of Death - teaser 2.png|A teaser image from Mod Ed's Twitter account two weeks before the quest release.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* The word for \"moon\" in the quest is \"rani,\" and the word for sun is \"ralo,\" which is a reference to [[Ranul]] and [[Ralos]], the gods of the moon and the sun.  \n* Despite the name and reward of the quest, the only farming related activity the player does is cutting one set of vines with a pair of secateurs.\n* Once you successfully translate the [[Stone tablet (The Garden of Death)|stone tablet]] for the first time, the first sentence is two words: \"Amok Time.\" This is the title of the [[wikipedia:Amok_Time|first episode of the second season]] of the 1966 television series ''[[wikipedia:Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series|Star Trek]]''.\n* Once fully translated so that all of the text is green the tablets read as follows: \n** Little time.

Speak to her and she will hand over a [[list]] of the plants she needs. Speak to her once more for the trolley.\n\n===Farming equipment===\nThroughout the quest the player should have these items present in their inventory.\n\n*A [[rake]]\n*A [[seed dibber]]\n*A [[spade]]\n*[[Secateurs]]\n*A [[watering can]]\n*A [[gardening trowel]]\n\n===Ring enchantment===\nPlayers should then get the [[ring of charos]] obtained from [[Creature of Fenkenstrain]], head for [[Draynor Village]], and talk to the [[Wise Old Man]]. Be careful, if you have more than one ring of charos in your inventory ''or'' bank, the others will disappear. He will tell a story about [[Queen Ellamaria]] before she was married to [[King Roald]], as well as the origin of the ring of charos. Give the ring to the Wise Old Man, after which he will ask seven questions to test whether the player is capable for the possession of an activated ring. Note that if you answer the first six questions correctly, the seventh question can be answered in any way. The questions are below, with the correct answers in bold:\n\n1/7: Two goblins are fighting over the colour of their armour. What do you do?\n\n*Leave them to it. Armour's not going to help - any noob could take them.\n*Kill them both and steal their bronze spears.\n*'''Show them a range of colours so that they can come to a compromise.'''\n\n2/7: A Drunken dwarf offers you a kebab. What do you do?\n\n*Run away leaving the lonely dwarf on its own.\n*Stand there until he gets annoyed and attacks you.\n*'''Take his generous gift even though you have no need for it.'''\n\n3/7: Are you enjoying your experience of Farming?\n\n*Yes.\n*Definitely.\n*'''It's absolutely, unquestionably the most interesting thing I've ever done!'''\n\n4/7: A dwarf asks you to put on a silly golden helmet so that you can be fired from a cannon into a wall. What do you do?\n\n*Refuse this crazy request blankly.\n*Put the helmet on the dwarf and fire him into the wall.\n*'''Put on the silly helmet and jump into the cannon.'''\n\n5/7: You meet Pkmaster0036 in the wilderness who asks you who is the greatest player killer in the world. How do you answer?\n\n*Cower in fear and quickly cast teleport to Varrock.\n*I am, prepare to meet your doom Pkmaster0036!\n*'''You of course Pkmaster0036, no one could ever challenge your greatness!'''\n\n6/7: Queen Ellamaria orders you to go on a foolish quest without any offer of reward. What do you say?\n\n*Stop ordering me about and get back behind the bar where you belong!\n*I'll do whatever you ask - I just love the monarchy!\n*'''Ask me nicely and I might consider it.'''\n\n7/7: A Draynor bank guard asks you if you've seen any suspicious characters lately, because the bank has been robbed. What do you say?\n\n*Yes, that wise old man over there looks incredibly dodgy.\n*If I do I'll let you know.\n*'''No, especially not that wise old man, who doesn't look at all suspicious.'''\n\nAfter answering the questions correctly, the Wise Old Man will enchant the ring of charos and return it to the player. The player will need to wear the activated ring (shown as \"ring of charos(a)\") and use the dialogue with \"(Charm)\" to persuade most of the [[NPCs]] the queen asked to find. You can try to charm the wise old man but you will fail.\n\n'''Note:''' Answering most of the questions correctly is enough to receive the enchantment.\n\n==Obtaining the seeds==\n:'''Note:''' Players can visit the NPCs in any order. Also, note that when crops you plant for [[Elstan]], [[Lyra]] and [[Kragen]] fully grow, you will receive a message in your chat box. The seeds for these NPCs '''must''' be planted '''after''' talking to them. Using an [[amulet of nature]] can be very helpful for this quest. The allotments cannot be protected by flowers.\n\n===Elstan, farming patch south of Falador===\n'''''Items required:''' [[ring of charos(a)]], [[#Farming equipment|farming equipment]] and a [[marigold seed]].''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' [[compost]]/[[supercompost]]/[[ultracompost]]''\nGo to the [[Farming/Patch locations|farming patch]] between [[Falador]] and [[Draynor Village]], north of the cabbage patch.\n\n*Wear the [[Ring of charos(a)]].\n*Speak to the gardener [[Elstan]].\n*Ask if he has any delphinium seeds to spare.\n**\"Do you have any delphinium seeds to spare?\"\n*Select the 'charm' responses until he asks you to plant some [[marigolds]].

Ah, just what I wanted to hear...\"\n**'''Do not select (Charm).''' Instead, select: \"Okay, I'll grow you some marigolds.\"\n*After speaking with Elstan, the player must grow marigolds in the nearby [[flower patch]] from seed to flower.\n**Marigolds take 20 minutes to grow, so it is advisable to move to the next portion of the quest and return once they are grown.\n**Marigolds planted before Elstan's request '''will not count'''.\n**Use [[compost]] (or [[supercompost]]/[[ultracompost]]), water, and plant cure as you would with any other crop.\n*Harvest the marigolds and give them to Elstan\n*In exchange for the harvested marigolds, Elstan will hand over the [[delphinium seed]]s. If you lose these seeds, speak to Elstan again, and he will provide you with more.\n\n===Lyra, farming patch west of Port Phasmatys===\n\n'''''Items required:''' [[ring of charos(a)]], [[#Farming equipment|farming equipment]], 3 [[onion seed]]s''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' [[compost]]/[[supercompost]]/[[ultracompost]] ([[Bottomless compost bucket]] will work here), the [[Ectophial]] or [[Dramen staff|Dramen]]/[[Lunar staff|Lunar]] staff for [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|alq}}'' or [[Fenkenstrain's Castle Teleport]] '', and a [[plant cure]].''\n\n:'''Note:''' Farming payment will not work for this section.\n\nGo to the [[Farming/Patch locations|farming patch]] between [[Port Phasmatys]] and [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]].

'''Agree to her offer without using the \"charm\" option.''' If you use it, she will refuse and you will have to agree anyway.\n**\"(Charm) If you tell me your problems, I may be able to help you.\"\n**\"(Charm) Yes, I was wondering about that.\"\n**\"(Charm) Times must be very hard for you.\"\n**\"(Charm) Whatever you've done, I'm sure you had just cause.\"\n**\"(Charm) And what is the nature of this fee that you pay?\"\n**\"(Charm) If not yours, then whose blood are you offering?\"\n**\"(Charm) How can you deal with so much guilt?\"\n**'''Do not select (Charm).''' Instead, select: \"That's a deal - I'll grow a patch of onions for you.\"\n*After speaking with Lyra, the player must grow onions in a nearby [[allotment patch]].\n**Onions take 40 minutes to grow, so it is advisable to move to the next portion of the quest and return once they are grown.\n**Onions planted before [[Lyra]] asks you to grow them '''will not count'''.\n**The flower patch '''must be empty'''.<!-- Needs confirmation - nasturtium in the flower patch does not seem to cause any issues. Maybe just need to avoid marigold or white lily? -->\n**Use [[compost]] (or [[supercompost]]/[[ultracompost]]), water, and plant cure as you would with any other crop.\n\nWhen the onions are fully grown, speak to [[Lyra]] again. She will give you three [[yellow orchid seed]]s and three [[pink orchid seed]]s for your effort.\n\n===Kragen, farming patch north of Ardougne===\n'''''Items required:''' [[ring of charos(a)]], [[#Farming equipment|farming equipment]], and 3 [[cabbage seed]]s.''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' [[compost]]/[[supercompost]]/[[ultracompost]] ([[Bottomless compost bucket]] will work here), [[Dramen staff|Dramen]]/[[Lunar staff|Lunar]] staff for [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|blr}} or a [[Skills necklace|Skills Necklace]] ([[Fishing Guild]] teleport) and a [[plant cure]].''\n\n:'''Note:''' Farming payment will not work for this section.\n\nGo to the [[Farming/Patch locations|farming patch]] north of [[East Ardougne]].

'''Agree to his offer without using the \"charm\" option.''' If you use it, he will refuse and you will have to agree anyway.\n**\"(Charm) You seem to be a little irritable, my friend.\"\n**\"(Charm) I don't like to see a fellow human being so upset.\"\n**\"(Charm) So what ails you, my friend?\"\n**\"(Charm) Well, is there anything I can do for you?\"\n**\"(Charm) So what can I do for you?\"\n**'''Do not select (Charm).''' Instead, select: \"That's a deal – I'll let you know when your cabbages are ready.\"\n*After speaking with Kragen, the player must grow [[cabbage]]s in a nearby [[allotment patch]].\n**Cabbage takes 40 minutes to grow, so it is advisable to move to the next portion of the quest and return once they are grown.\n**Cabbages planted before [[Kragen]] asks you to grow them '''will not count'''.\n**The flower patch '''must be empty'''.\n**Use [[compost]] (or [[supercompost]]/[[ultracompost]]), water, and plant cure as you would with any other crop.\n*When the [[cabbage]]s are fully grown, speak to Kragen again.\n**\"Okay, I've grown those cabbages like you asked.\"\n*He will reward your efforts with four [[snowdrop seed]]s.\n\n===Dantaera, farming patch in Catherby===\n'''''Items required:''' [[ring of charos(a)]], a [[gardening trowel]], [[secateurs]], a [[watering can]], a [[spade]], and a [[filled plant pot]] (can be bought from [[Vanessa]] next to the allotment farming patch north of Catherby).''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' a [[Camelot teleport]] and an [[amulet of glory]] (for [[Edgeville]] teleport), or having started [[The Giant Dwarf]].''\n[[File:Garden of Tranquillity - White Tree.png|frame|The white tree on Ice Mountain.]]\n\n*Go to [[Catherby]] farming patch\n*Talk to [[Dantaera]].\n**\"Do you know how I could grow a White Tree?\"\n*Charm her.\n**\"(Charm) I think that there is something that you are not telling me.\"\n**\"(Charm) A secret is a dreadful burden to have to keep to yourself.\"\n**\"(Charm) Unless you allow me to do this she will die anyway.\"\n*Dantaera will let you cut a branch of the [[white tree]], which is on the top of [[Ice Mountain]]. Located west of [[Edgeville]] and north-east of [[Falador]] ''(not to be confused with [[White Wolf Mountain]])'', near the [[Oracle]].\n*After talking to Dantaera, the player should prepare a [[filled plant pot]], a pair of [[secateurs]], a [[gardening trowel]] and a [[watering can]] with water.\n*Teleport to [[Edgeville]] or the Monastery via Combat Bracelet and head west, to the top of Ice Mountain and find the white tree.\n*Use the pair of secateurs on the tree, and the player will get a [[white tree shoot]].\n*Use it on the plant pot with soil (you will need a gardening trowel) and water it.\n*After a while, the branch will grow into a sapling and is ready to be planted in the tree patch in [[Ellamaria]]'s garden in [[Varrock]].\n\n===Brother Althric, Edgeville Monastery===\n'''Players should ''not'' throw away or destroy the ring ''before'' being told by Althric to do so.

'''Players should ''not'' throw away or destroy the ring ''before'' being told by Althric to do so.'''\n*Go to Edgeville and throw the [[ring of charos(a)]] in the well. '''You will recover it later, that's what the fishing rod is for.'''[[File:Garden of Tranquillity - Fishing ring of charos.png|thumb|220px|Fishing back the ring of charos.]]\n\n:'''Note:''' It is suggested that the player should go to Edgeville and throw the ring in the local well. Otherwise, the player will have to go to [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]] or Harmony Island with the completion of the Great Brain Robbery and pickpocket [[Dr Fenkenstrain]] again in order to recover the ring. He is located at the top floor of the castle or the basement of the windmill.\n\n*With the ring thrown away or destroyed, players can go to the monastery and attempt to take the seeds again. This time, Brother Althric will be pleased and will allow the player to take the rose seeds.\n**Players need all three kinds of rose seeds - [[red rose seed]]s, [[pink rose seed]]s and [[white rose seed]]s.\n**If the player has thrown the ring into the well, the monk will mention a method to recover it.\n*Players should get their own [[Fishing rod|fishing]]/[[fly fishing rod]], ([[oily fishing rod]] and [[barbarian rod]] do not work) and use it with the well in Edgeville. It might take several tries, but the ring can eventually be recovered. If it is thrown into the well it is NOT possible to pickpocket a new one, it must be retrieved from the well.\n\n===Bernald, The Toad and Chicken in Burthorpe===\n'''''Items required:''' [[ring of charos(a)]], a [[rune essence|rune]]/[[pure essence]], a [[pestle and mortar]], 2 [[plant cure]]s and a [[hammer]].''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' a [[games necklace]] (for teleport).''\n\nGo to [[Burthorpe]] (you can use a [[games necklace]] or the [[Grouping]] teleport) and go to [[The Toad and Chicken]] pub. Equip your ring of charos, and enter the garden on the eastern side. Talk to [[Bernald]] and charm him. He will tell the player that his vines are dying and needs a cure. Use '''''one''''' plant cure on the vine, and you will find it's not working. Talk to Bernald again, and he will instruct you to find [[Alain]] at [[Taverley]].\n\nHead south to the [[tree patch]] in Taverley (near the entrance gate dividing the [[members]] and [[free-to-play]] areas) and speak to Alain. He will provide a method of enhancing the [[plant cure]]'s power. '''Do not use the \"charm\" option in dialogue, or he will refuse to help you.'''\n\nAfter speaking with [[Alain]], use a [[hammer]] on a [[rune essence|rune]]/[[pure essence]] to crush the stone into [[rune shards]], and then use the [[pestle and mortar]] on the shards to make some [[rune dust]]. Use the dust with the remaining plant cure potion to get a [[Plant cure (Garden of Tranquillity)|strengthened plant cure]]. Bring the potion back to Bernald in Burthorpe, and use it on the diseased vines. The vines will now be cured.\n\nTalk to Bernald, and he will give some Burthorpe [[vine seed]]s. If you lose these seeds, talk to Bernald, and he will provide you with more.\n\n==Getting the statues==\n'''''Items required:''' [[trolley]] (obtained during quest)''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' a [[Lumbridge teleport|Lumbridge]] and [[Falador teleport]].''\n\n:'''Note:''' The plants take a while to grow (the white tree being the longest time), so it is recommended to [[#Gardening|do the gardening now]] and to get the statues while the plants are growing.\n\n:'''Note:''' Teleporting away after using the trolley on the statue, including via [[random events]], can reset your progress and you may need to return to [[Ellamaria]] to get another.\n\nTalk to [[Ellamaria]] and ask about getting the statues. She will provide a [[trolley]] for the player to push or pull the statues.\n\nWhen there is a statue on the trolley, the player can choose to \"Push\" or \"Pull\" the trolley, causing the trolley to move one square away from or towards the player respectively. The option \"Big push\" allows the trolley to move several squares away from the player.\n\nA [[Teleportation|teleport]] is recommended for players to get to the statues' original places.\n===Statue of a former king, Lumbridge===\nWalk or teleport to [[Lumbridge]]; then, walk out of the [[Lumbridge Castle|castle]]. Examine both statues, and use the [[trolley]] on the one described as the statue of a \"king\" (should be the one on the south side).\n\nPush or pull the trolley across the bridge directly outside the castle. Once the trolley is on the other side of [[River Lum]], the scene will immediately change to the north backyard of [[Varrock Palace]]. Push or pull the trolley to the east, and then south into the [[Ellamaria|queen's]] garden (Note, the first statue (King) is the north-east plinth).\n\nBe careful not to get the trolley stuck or you will have to logout and log back in to reset it.\n\nIf the statue at any point gets \"recaptured\" (if you take too long to place it on the spot for the statue), you can get another trolley from the queen (Ellamaria) and you have to go back to Lumbridge and get the statue again.\n\nThe statue should be placed on the eastern side slot against the wall. When the trolley is pushed beside the spot, use the \"place\" option to place the statue, and the trolley will return to the player's inventory automatically.\n\n===Statue of Saradomin, Falador===\n{{Listen\n|title = Billy and Bob\n|align = right\n|filename = Billy and Bob (Garden of Tranquillity).ogg\n|desc = The track that plays during the cutscene.}}\n[[File:Garden of Tranquillity - Bob is killed.png|thumb|220px|A nearby player-killer creates a distraction.]]\nWalk or teleport to [[Falador]], and use the [[trolley]] on the statue in the city square (not the statue in the park). A [[cutscene]] will appear, showing two [[guard]]s, [[Bob, another guard of Falador|Bob]] and [[Billy, a guard of Falador|Billy]] at the north gate being killed by a player spoof named [[PKMaster0036]] while the player tries to push the statue onto the trolley.\n\nAfter the cutscene, the player should pull or push the trolley out of Falador ''as soon as possible''. If the player uses too much time, the guards will discover the statue has been stolen, and the player will have to start it all over again.\n\nOnce the trolley is out of Falador, the scene will immediately change to the north backyard of [[Varrock Palace]]. Again, push or pull the trolley to the east, and then south, into [[Ellamaria]]'s garden.\n\nThe statue should be placed on the central slot. When the trolley is next to the spot, use the \"place\" option to place the statue, and the trolley will return to the player's inventory automatically.\n\n==Gardening==\n'''''Items required:''' [[ring of charos(a)]], [[#Farming equipment|farming equipment]], two buckets of [[compost]] and all seeds and saplings from earlier sections. '''Note:''' There is no [[tool leprechaun]] in the garden. The nearest one is at the tree patch on the eastern side of the palace courtyard. Also, you cannot use the Bottomless compost bucket to do the required task and need two composts/supercomposts/ultracomposts in un-noted form.''\n[[File:Garden of Tranquillity - Garden map.png|left|thumb|265x265px|A map showing where each seed should be planted.]]\nYou will not need to add [[compost]] to the allotments in the garden, nor water any of the patches. Use the [[rake]] to wipe out the [[weeds]] in all farming patches, and plant the seeds/sapling to where they should be placed. However, you will need to add compost to the orchid pots before planting them. The plants in Ellamaria's garden take 10–15 minutes to grow and cannot die. Make sure you've watered your White Tree Shoot or it won't work when you try to plant it.\n\nAfter all patches are fully grown and the statues are in place, talk to [[Ellamaria]], and she will ask the player to get [[King Roald]]. Go to King Roald, located in the south-east side of the [[Varrock Palace|Palace]] on the ground floor.\n[[File:Garden of Tranquillity - Ending cutscene.png|right|thumb|220px|King Roald is not pleased with the garden, resulting in \"Ellie\" scolding him.]]\n{{Listen\n|title = Touring the Garden\n|align = right\n|filename = Touring the Garden (Garden of Tranquillity).ogg\n|desc = The track that plays during the cutscene.}}\nTalk to him while wearing the ring of charos (a), and charm him when possible (or continue on without charming for an amusing conversation). A [[cutscene]] will play with the Queen of Varrock giving him a tour. Don't open any interfaces after the end of the cutscene or walk away from the queen, otherwise you will have to fetch the king again.\n\nAfter a short [[cutscene]], the queen will reward the player and the quest is complete.

They regrow after some time, similar to other fruit bearing trees. Each fruit restores about 8% of [[energy]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Garden of Tranquillity is required for the following:\n*[[Swan Song]]\n*Medium [[Varrock Diary]] (pick a [[white tree fruit]] - will take a few minutes for a fruit to spawn after finishing quest)\n*[[Defender of Varrock]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*The player spoof that comes and attacks the two guards while the player is taking the [[Falador]] statue has the same name as the [[Player killing|PKer]] that the [[Wise Old Man]] asks the player about.\n*Since the seventh question has two correct answers, it is possible that just getting six out of seven correct is all that is needed. Upon trying, any answer to the seventh question will work so long as the previous six were answered correctly.\n*Despite the fact that [[Queen Ellamaria]] says her patches \"have been filled with extremely fertile soil that was very expensive to import\", players still use regular compost on the plant pots to plant the orchids, although supercompost or ultracompost is also adequate.\n*When Queen Ellamaria slaps [[King Roald]] at the end of the last cutscene, a health bar shows up above the King's head.\n*When speaking to [[Kragen]], the player character charms him by asking \"What ails you, my friend?\" This may be a reference to Pepin the Healer from ''{{wp|Diablo (video game)|Diablo}}''. The player then asks \"So, what can I do for you?\" This may be a reference to Griswold the Blacksmith from the same game series.\n*The white tree is a reference to the Tree of Gondor from ''{{wp|The Lord of the Rings}}''.\n*If attempting to use the ring of charos to manipulate Alain, it won't work, and the player will say \"It only works on the weak minded!\" This is a reference to Jedi mind tricks in the ''{{wp|Star Wars}}'' franchise.\n*After speaking to either [[Kragen]] or [[Lyra]] and planting their respective crops, if players ask for either to watch the plot they will respond \"I can't believe you're asking me to do that! I asked you to grow some _____ for me, not for me to look after them for you! No, I won't look after them!\"\n*Whilst fishing in the [[Edgeville]] well for the [[Ring of charos|ring of charos(a)]], the player character may say \"la-de-da\", \"dum-de-dum\", \"Nice day for it\", \"(whistles happy tune)\" or \"oh come on...\" depending on how long it takes to successfully retrieve the ring.\n*If the Player does not equip the  [[Ring of charos|ring of charos(a)]] while talking to [[King Roald]] at the end of the Quest some funny dialogue can be seen.\n\n{{Garden of Tranquillity}}"

Ask him if he needs a hand with anything, and he'll tell you that some strange beast has been stealing his livestock, and is seeking an adventurer to help them, as the [[Shayzien soldier]]s are too busy dealing with [[lizardmen]] to help. Agree to help him, and he'll tell you he doesn't exactly know where the beast is, but he'll tell you to try asking his wife, [[Mary (Getting Ahead)|Mary]], who is in their house.\n\nMary will tell you that the beast only comes in the night, so they've never had the chance to get a proper look at it. She suggests, however, that if the beast was coated in flour, it might be easier to track down.\n\nIf you don't already have a [[pot of flour]], go upstairs and take one. While here, take the [[needle]] and [[thread]] as well, as you'll need them later. Talk to Gordon again, who will tell you that the beast has been mainly targeting their cattle, and he had built a gate by their pen to try to keep it out. Use the pot of flour on the southern gate (just north of the bridge), and you'll begin to see a [[flour (Getting Ahead)|trail of flour]] going southward. Before tracking the beast, take the [[hammer]] by the gate to use towards the end of the quest.\n{{Map|1255,3684|1256,3678|1255,3665|1248,3658|1236,3657|1226,3656|1217,3655|1213,3649|mtype=line|ptype=object|align=right|caption=The trail of [[Flour (Getting Ahead)|flour]]}}\n\n===A Strange Beast===\n{{Needed|Combat equipment}}\n[[File:Getting Ahead - fighting Headless Beast.png|thumb|250px|A player fights the Headless Beast from a safespot.]]\nFollow the trail of flour, which ends at the [[Kebos Lowlands mine]]. Before entering the cave, take the two [[plank]]s by the broken rowboat and mine some clay, as it will be used later. Enter the cave to do battle with the [[Headless Beast]].\n\nThe [[Headless Beast]] uses melee attacks, and has a special attack in which it slams the ground, resulting in a large rock crashing on the player. The rock can be avoided by stepping away before it hits the ground. The beast can be safespotted by trapping it around the pond, where it will never perform the special attack.\n\nUpon killing the beast, search the [[Skeleton (Getting Ahead)|skeleton]] nearby to receive [[Neilan's journal]], revealing the beast was the work of a necromancer from the mainland. Return to Gordon, who refuses to pay you as you can't prove you've killed the beast.\n\n===A Strange Fake===\n{{Needed|[[Soft clay]], [[knife]], [[bear fur]], [[needle]], [[thread]], [[red dye]], [[hammer]], [[saw]], two [[plank]]s, six nails of any kind}}\n\nTalk to Mary, who suggests to have you make a fake head via the use of clay modelling to fool her husband. Use a [[knife]] and a piece of [[soft clay]] to create a [[clay head]], and return to Gordon. (If you need to soften the clay you mined at the [[Kebos Lowlands mine]] then take advantage of the bucket spawn and the sink which are in the same room as Mary.) Still not convinced, add [[bear fur]] to the head (while having a [[needle]] and [[thread]]) to create a [[fur head]] and speak to him again. He will remain unconvinced, so add a [[red dye]] (found by searching the [[Shelves (Getting Ahead)|shelves]] next to the stairs in the house) to create a [[bloody head]].\n[[File:Getting Ahead - Gordon fooled.png|thumb|250px|Gordon is fooled by the mounted head, much to your and Mary's relief.]]\n\nThe bloody head will finally convince him, and he asks that you mount the head in his house. A Mounted Head Space will appear by the staircase in the house. Players will need a [[hammer]], [[saw]], nails of any kind, and two [[plank]]s.\n\nA hammer can be found by the gate where you poured the flour, while the saw can be found by the small barn with the [[ancient machinery]]. The workbench inside can also be searched for twenty [[iron nails]]. [[Plank]]s can be found just west of the entrance to the Headless Beast Cave.

You will come into Port Phasmatys from the north but for low level players this is a safe route.\n<!-- This map does not use the regular template as it cannot draw text labels; the GeoJSON used as an alternative is rather bloated, and is therefore placed in mapspace and transcluded here-->{{Map:Ghosts Ahoy locations}}\n\n===Pre-quest: Obtaining Ecto-tokens at the Ectofuntus===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ghostspeak amulet]], 7 [[empty buckets]], 7 [[empty pots]], and 7 [[bones]]''\n\nEctofuntus tokens are required to complete the quest and can be gathered before starting it. This is done by worshipping the [[Ectofuntus]] just north of [[Port Phasmatys]]. It is recommended to obtain 35 Ecto-tokens to finish the quest, (20 when using the [[ring of charos(a)]]). You can obtain these tokens in one trip by wearing your Ghostspeak amulet and bringing 7 empty buckets, 7 empty pots and 7 bones of any type to the Ectofuntus. Level 1 undead chickens can be killed near the farm west of the Ectofuntus to obtain the needed bones. Buckets and pots may be purchased in [[Port Phasmatys]], but note that you cannot enter the town before gathering Ecto-tokens unless you enter via a [[charter ship]] from [[Port Sarim]] which costs a little over 1k gp.\n\nYou will then need to follow the steps below to obtain untradeable [[Bucket of slime|buckets of slime]] and [[bonemeal]] in order to then worship the Ectofuntus and earn tokens:\n\n# Enter the trapdoor to the west of the fountain inside the temple. If you have 58 [[Agility]] use the [[weathered wall]] [[shortcut]] in front of you, otherwise walk around to the opposite side of the cavern and climb down the stairs, then repeat this process for the next two sets of stairs. Use a bucket on the [[Pool of Slime]]: this will automatically fill all the buckets in your inventory over the next few seconds. Walk back up the stairs and up the ladder.\n# Go up the stairs east of the Ectofuntus. Use a bone on the loader located on the right side of the [[bone grinder]], making sure to '''use''' the bones and not bury them. This will begin an automated process where the player will load one of the bones, turn the wheel, empty the bin to retrieve the completed bonemeal, and then automatically repeat this for each subsequent bone. However, interacting with each part of the grinder will speed up this process.\n# Return to the Ectofuntus and click on it to consume each set of bonemeal and slime. While wearing your ghostspeak amulet, talk to a [[ghost disciple]] to receive your Ecto-tokens.\n\n===Beginning the quest===\n<!-- This map does not use the regular template as it cannot draw text labels; the GeoJSON used as an alternative is rather bloated, and is therefore placed in mapspace and transcluded here-->{{Map:Ghosts Ahoy NPCs}}\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ghostspeak amulet]] and 4 [[Ecto-tokens]]''\n\nPay 2 ecto-tokens (right click the Energy Barrier entrance located north of Port Phasmatys) and go to the house directly east to speak to [[Velorina]]. She will explain the sad history of the ghosts of Port Phasmatys. She will ask you to speak to [[Necrovarus]] located at the [[Ectofuntus]] temple to allow any ghost who wishes to pass over into the next world.\n\nHead west of Velorina's house and pass the Energy Barrier again to be outside of the town's walls. Speak to Necrovarus located in the Ectofuntus temple. Necrovarus becomes furious over you mentioning Velorina and demands you be silent, refusing to listen to any reasoning.\n\nPass the Energy Barrier back into the city and speak to Velorina again. She mentions another approach: speaking to an old friend who may be used as aid without Necrovarus's involvement. When asked where she may be located, Velorina explains a vision of a small wooden shack in Morytania, where a sea is very close and castles loom to the west and east.\n\n===The old crone and nettle tea===\n{{Map|x=3464|y=3559|zoom=1|title=[[Old Crone]]|mtype=pin|align=right|icon=redPin|caption=The [[Old Crone]]'s house|width=220|height=220}}\n'''''Items required:''' [[Nettle tea]] (or the ingredients to make: [[Nettles]], [[tinderbox]], [[logs]], [[gloves]], a [[bowl of water]]) and a [[bucket of milk]].''\n\nGo out of Port Phasmatys from the Energy Barrier and head west towards Canifis. If you need to make the nettle tea, follow the directions below while heading to Canifis:\n\n*Fill the empty bowl with water by using the bowl on the waterpump located west of the farm allotment patches. (Empty bowls can be purchased from the charter ships on the Phasmatys docks, buy 3 to be safe)\n*Continue west towards Canifis until you reach the Slayer master [[Mazchna]]. Just east will be a patch of [[nettles]]. Wear your gloves and pick some; it is recommended to pick some spare nettles, since the Nettle-water can boil over when making tea. Note: gloves that '''cannot be used to pick up nettles''' include Slayer gloves, Ranger gloves, Infinity gloves, Moonclan gloves and Lunar gloves. A pair of coloured gloves can be purchased for 650 coins from Barker's Haberdashery in Canifis.\n*Use the nettles on the bowl of water.\n*Light a fire using your tinderbox and logs and use the bowl on fire. '''Avoid accidentally drinking the bowl'''. The bowl can also be boiled on a range, however there are no ranges in Canifis.\n\nHead north-west of the Slayer master [[Mazchna]] to the [[Old crone]]'s house, shown on the map as a red pin (between the [[Slayer Tower]] and the [[Mausoleum]]).\n\nSpeak to the [[Old crone]]. When asked if she was a disciple of Necrovarus in the Temple of Phasmatys, she will have a hard time remembering due to her old age. She will mention that nettle tea will help refresh her memory as well as where you can find nettles.\n\nIf you have the nettle tea already made, she will exclaim that she only drinks from her special cup. She will give you a porcelain cup to pour the nettle tea into. '''Avoid accidentally drinking the bowl'''.\n\nSpeak to the Old crone again where she will refuse the tea again due to no milk being added. Add the bucket of milk to the cup of tea. '''Avoid accidentally drinking the cup of tea'''.\n\nSpeak to the Old crone again, this time she will remember being a disciple of Necrovarus. When Velorina's name is mentioned, she will remember her as a very good friend and ask how she is doing. After being told she's now a ghost, she regrets running away rather than stopping what was happening. She knows a way to help those wanting to pass over into the next world using the [[Ghostspeak amulet]]. She explains that enchanting the amulet will give power of command over ghosts; one charge will allow you to command Necrovarus to let the ghosts pass on. She explains that Necrovarus must have a magical robe that can be used to perform the enchantment. She will also need his book of rituals called [[Haricanto]] written by an ancient sorcerer from the East and [[Translation manual|a book to translate]] these rituals.\n\nAsk her if there is anything else you can do for her. She will speak about her son, and at the age of 12 years old, he ran away with some pirates to be a cabin boy. She asks if you see him, give him the toy model boat that he made. She will give you the [[model ship]].\n\n===Enchanting the amulet===\n====''The Book of Haricanto''====\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ghostspeak amulet]], [[Model ship]], [[silk]], a [[needle]], [[thread]], a [[knife]], [[dyes]] (3 [[Red dye|red]], 3 [[Blue dye|blue]], and/or 3 [[Yellow dye|yellow]], the colour used will be random for each person), a [[spade]], 27 [[ecto-tokens]], and Food/Combat gear to defeat a [[Giant lobster (Ghosts Ahoy)|Giant lobster]] (level 32)''\n[[File:Poor_man.png|thumb|220x220px|Poor man!]]Head to the [[Canifis]] bank and retrieve the items required. You can buy the needle, thread, and knife from the nearby [[Canifis General Store]]. Make sure to still have your Ghostspeak amulet and ecto-tokens.\nRepair the model ship by using silk, needle, thread, and knife.\n\nGo east towards Port Phasmatys. Before you pass the undead cows and undead chickens, go to the wrecked ship on the north coast of the farming patch (refer to map; the boat will appear as water on the mini map).\n\nClimb up the ship's ladder to the ship deck. Head east and climb the ship's ladder just outside the small room (on the wall next to the cabin) with the Old man and the Pirate Captain to get to the ship quarterdeck.\n\nThe wind speeds will appear on the top right hand side; wait for the wind speed to change to low. Search the mast in the centre of the deck to find what colour the flag is comprised of. Different parts of the flag and the skull emblem are different colours. Make sure you dye the right parts of your toy ship with the right colours. You will need to check the mast a minimum of 3 times to get all 3 colours needed. Now mix the dyes you need and dye the model ship to match the colours seen from the mast. If you make a mistake when painting, simply paint over the piece again.\n\n*[[Red dye|Red]] + [[Yellow dye|Yellow]] = [[Orange dye|Orange]]\n*[[Red dye|Red]] + [[Blue dye|Blue]] = [[Purple dye|Purple]]\n*[[Blue dye|Blue]] + [[Yellow dye|Yellow]] = [[Green dye|Green]]\n\nHead back down the ship's ladder to the ship deck and talk to the [[Old man]]. Ask him if the model ship is his and he'll recognise it. For giving his model ship back, he'll give you a [[Chest key (Ghosts Ahoy)|chest key]].\n\n[[File:Ghosts Ahoy - Lobster fight.png|thumb|220x220px|The lobster fight.]]\nUse the key on the closed chest inside the captain's quarters to receive the first [[map scrap]].\n\nGo to the north-west side of the deck where there is a gangplank you can walk onto rocks. Jump along the path of rocks (this requires 25 agility). Each jump costs 5% of your run energy. It is possible to fail the jumps by falling on your face but you won't fall in the water. When you get to the end, there will be another chest with the second map scrap. Once you have the second map scrap, head back to the ship.\n\nClimb down the ship's ladder. When you open the next chest you will be attacked - '''be ready to fight'''. Search the chests until you are attacked by a [[Giant lobster (Ghosts Ahoy)|giant lobster]] ''(level 32)'' with a blinking yellow arrow over it. Once you kill it, search the chest again for the final map scrap.\n\nYou can [[safespot]] the lobster by standing west of the ladder (the one nearest to the chests) and using [[Magic]] or [[Ranged]]. However, if you do not kill the lobster fast enough (within two minutes), it will disappear and you will have to fight it again from full health.\n\n[[File:Ghosts Ahoy_treasure.png|thumb|220x220px|The location of the book.]]\n\nAfter you've received all pieces, use one piece on another to get a completed [[treasure map]]. It marks where to find treasure on [[Dragontooth Island]]. Head east to [[Port Phasmatys]]. Pass the Energy Barrier to enter the town and go to the bank. If you haven't already, grab 27 ecto-tokens (or 10, if you have an [[activated ring of charos]]), a [[spade]], and the treasure map.\n\n{{Map|3803,3530|3804,3530|3804,3529|3803,3529|title=The location of the<br/>[[book of haricanto|book of Haricanto]]|mtype=polygon|zoom=3|align=right|width=220|height=220}}\n\nHead north-east from the bank onto the dock and find the Ghost captain next to the small rowing boat. Ask him to take you to Dragontooth Island, and he will oblige for a 25 ecto-token fee (10 with an [[activated ring of charos]], or 500 for permanent access). Once there, use the map to find the treasure. You can proceed to the square pictured to the right. You will be standing in the only grass-less square in the clearing. If you follow the instructions from the map you will start by standing west of the Statue of Saradomin. From there, walk 6 steps '''south''', 8 steps '''east''', 2 steps '''north''', 4 steps '''east''', and 22 steps '''south'''. Dig with a spade and you will find the [[Book of haricanto|book of Haricanto]].\n\n====The translation manual====\n'''''Items required:''' Around 400 [[coins]] and an [[oak longbow]].''\n\nAfter finding the Book of Haricanto, head north to the ghost captain and travel back to Port Phasmatys. Go to the bank just south-west of the boat, and take out the 400 [[coins]] and the [[oak longbow]].\n\nHead north of the bank. Go onto the docks just east of the pub/inn and talk to [[Ak-Haranu]]. He is a trader from the east. After being asked if he has a book that can be used to translate, he'll tell you he has the [[Translation manual|manual]], but in trade for it, he wants Robin's signature on an oak longbow.\n\nGo to the pub/inn just west of Ak-Haranu and talk to [[Robin]]. He'll challenge you to a game of [[Rune-Draw]]. Beat him at it a few times until he owes you 100 coins (the objective of the game is to get as many points as possible, awarded when you draw a rune, before drawing a [[death rune]], which results in an automatic loss; if Robin draws a death rune before you, you win). He will give you his signature to repay the debt.\n\nTake it back to Ak-Haranu and he'll give you the manual as promised.\n====The robes====\n'''''Items required: '''[[Ghostspeak amulet]] and [[bucket of slime]] (can be purchased during quest)''\n\nHead back to the pub/inn (where [[Robin]] was) and speak to the [[Ghost innkeeper]]. Ask him if he has any jobs for you and he will give you a [[bedsheet]] that he wants you to take to [[Robin]]. Rather than doing that, keep the bedsheet; you will be using it to disguise yourself as a ghost.\n\nGhosts do not look like bedsheets, so to make it passable you need to colour it with [[Ectofuntus]] slime. A fast way to get some slime is by trading with one of the [[Trader crewmember]]s on the east docks and buying a [[bucket of slime]] to dip the bedsheet in. Alternatively, use the Ectofuntus by walking down to the slime pool with an empty bucket, and fill it with slime. After you get the bucket of slime, dip the sheet into it.\n\nGo to the town square near the north entrance of Port Phasmatys and talk to [[Gravingas]], the ghost activist protesting and carrying a sign. He will ask if you will partake in the protest, to which you will accept happily. He'll give you a [[Petition form]] to collect signatures from the townsfolk. Put your dyed bedsheet on and gather 10 signatures.\n\nSpeak to any ghost villager nearby for signatures. As long as you don't talk to the same person twice in a row, you can ask the same two or three ghosts for all 10 signatures. If they ask for ecto-tokens, move onto the next ghost that doesn't require payment. Alternatively, you could ask the same people by switching worlds. Repeat until they say \"yes\" enough times to have 10 signatures.\n\nWith all 10 signatures, talk to Gravingas. He will ask you to go back to [[Necrovarus]] and show him the petition.\n\nHead north of Gravingas and pass the Energy Barrier. Speak to Necrovarus and show him the petition form. He will ask you to continue explaining the petition which outlines that the citizens of Port Phasmatys should have the right to choose whether they pass over to the next world or not. He will sarcastically say that he understands, then flies into a rage, causing him to drop a [[Bone key (Ghosts Ahoy)|bone key]]. Pick it up and head upstairs. Use the key on the locked door to get into his room. Open and search the coffin to find [[Mystical robes|his robes]]. Leave the room and head back downstairs.\n\n===Using the spell===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Mystical robes]], [[Book of haricanto|Book of Haricanto]], [[translation manual]], and a [[Ghostspeak amulet]].''\n\nFrom the Ectofuntus, head back to the Old Crone, just north of Canifis.\n\nGive her the [[Mystical robes|robes]], [[Book of haricanto|book]], [[Translation manual|manual]], and Ghostspeak amulet in your possession. The Old crone will perform an enchantment ritual - dancing - on your amulet, empowering it.\n\nHead back east to the [[Ectofuntus]] and speak with [[Necrovarus]]; make sure your ghostspeak amulet is equipped. Command Necrovarus to release all the ghosts he's holding. You can command him to tell you the joke first or do the chicken impersonation; both of which won't deplete the ghost amulet's charge. A beam of green light will radiate out from the amulet, enveloping Necrovarus in its power. He will appear to become much softer in the eyes and stare into nothingness. He will then allow the ghosts to pass at their will.\n\nOnce finished speaking to Necrovarus, pass through the Energy Barrier (this will not consume any ecto-tokens from now on) and speak to [[Velorina]]. She will tell you that she sensed the removal of Necrovarus's psychic barrier. She will then hand you a vial of ectoplasm as her thanks in return, and explain the use of this newly acquired item: an [[Ectophial]].\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Ghosts Ahoy|image=[[File:Ghosts Ahoy reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=2|rewards=*{{SCP|Prayer|2,400}} [[Prayer]] [[experience]]\n*Free passage into [[Port Phasmatys]]\n*The [[Ectophial]], which allows direct teleport to the [[Ectofuntus]], is refilled from the Ectofuntus.}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Ghosts Ahoy is required for the following:\n*[[Dragon Slayer II]]\n*[[Morytania Medium Diary]]\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 23 July 2015\n|update = Big Cats & WWF\n|change = A ghost during the [[Ghosts Ahoy]] quest now only speaks ghost when you do not have a [[ghostspeak amulet]] equipped.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Notes==\n*The [[Ectofuntus]] teleport is reasonably close to the [[fairy ring]] network by running west through [[Mort Myre Swamp]]. It's still much further than the [[slayer ring]] and [[quest cape]] teleports, however.\n*You can get multiple ectophials by asking [[Velorina]] for another.\n*Your character will refill the [[ectophial]] automatically upon teleporting.\n\n==Trivia==\n*If you speak to the old man after he gives you the chest key, he will tell you his mother is on her way to get him.\n*Before a patch on the 28th of November 2019, if you were to click away before the [[ectophial]] is refilled, it would not be refilled, and you would have to do it manually.\n*You can give Robin the bedsheets if you wish to do so. The innkeeper will give you another bedsheet to give Robin again.\n*The [[drop trick]] method can be used to obtain multiple bedsheets, in case you want a brown bedsheet as well as the ghost green bedsheet.\n*If you talk to Gravingas after the quest, your character will ask him why he's still protesting, to which he replies, \"There's always a need for a healthy interest in politics.\"\n\n{{Ghosts Ahoy}}"

A cutscene will ensue where he tells you about Keldagrim's rich history, before the boat \"malfunctions\" and crashes into the statue of [[King Alvis]]. Upon arriving at Keldagrim, you are arrested by two [[Black Guard Berserker]]s, and taken to the Black Guard headquarters where [[Commander Veldaban]] wants to talk with you. He asks you to replace the statue that was in need of replacement anyway.\n\n:'''''You can now use the [[Keldagrim minecart system]] throughout Gielinor.'''''\n'''Tip:''' To save some time bring with you: 200 coins, coal, logs and a tinderbox\n\nTalk to [[Blasidar the sculptor]].

Like the left boot, you'll first have to wait for Dromund to have his back turned.\n\nOnce both boots are obtained, they turn into [[Exquisite boots]].\n\n===An axe fit for a king===\n{{Needed|An [[iron bar]], 3 [[sapphire]]s, and a [[redberry pie]] (if you have not given [[Thurgo]] a free redberry pie in the past, with the required redberry pie for [[The Knight's Sword]] not counting).}}\n{{Map|name=Santiri|2828,10231|height=250|width=250|rectX=11|rectY=9|zoom=2|mapID=10|mtype=rectangle|align=left|caption=Santiri's location}}\n{{Map|name=Thurgo|3001,3144|height=250|width=250|r=2|mtype=square|align=right|caption=Thurgo's location}}\nTalk to [[Santiri]], the tradesman of the [[Quality Weapons Shop|sword shop]] in north-west [[Keldagrim]]. He talks about how his family came to possess the [[Dwarven battleaxe]], mentioning it has been damaged and that the [[sapphire]]s on the hilt had either been stolen or washed away. During the dialogue where you offer to repair the axe, Santiri may note your mastery of [[Smithing]] but exclaims that even you aren't skilled enough. Santiri gives you the axe, then use three sapphires on it to rebuild the hilt. Talk to Santiri again, who says that only an [[Imcando dwarf]] could repair it.\n\nIf you have not completed [[The Knight's Sword]], Santiri will refer you to the [[librarian]], just east of his shop. Ask him about finding an Imcando dwarf. He refers you to [[Reldo]] in the [[Varrock Palace]]. Speak to Reldo and he will teach you about them.\n\nIf you have completed [[The Knight's Sword]], your character will mention that they know an Imcando dwarf and you can go straight to [[Thurgo]].\n\nThurgo resides in the single house at [[Mudskipper Point]], south-east of [[Rimmington]] and south of [[Port Sarim]]. The fastest way to get there is to travel using [[Fairy rings]] to {{Fairycode|AIQ}}. Go to him with an [[iron bar]], and ask him to repair the axe. After that, if you have not yet given him a [[redberry pie]] for '''free''' previously, you must give him one now. He will then repair the axe.\n\n'''''Note:''' If you happen to lose the axe after having it repaired, Thurgo will supply you with another repaired axe, although it is ungemmed and you will need to apply three sapphires again.''\n\nWhen Thurgo is done, you have the option to return immediately to Keldagrim. This will place you back in [[Blasidar the sculptor]]'s house.\n\n===The Head===\nGive [[Riki the sculptor's model|Riki]] the axe, clothes and boots by speaking to him with the items in your inventory. Talk to [[Blasidar the sculptor|Blasidar]], who explains that the Consortium wants the head of the statue modelled after one of its directors, but has not agreed which one. He asks you to go and help them make a decision. You will see a short cutscene of the incomplete statue.\n\n:'''Make sure to complete this step before starting the tasks below, or the tasks for the director will go on indefinitely!'''\n\n===Joining the consortium===\nThere are eight mining companies in the [[Consortium]], which are located upstairs in either the east or west marketplace. You will need to join one of them, and this choice will only change the [[Giant Dwarf (statue)|final model of the statue]] built at the end of the quest. You should choose a company on the west side of the building for faster bank access if you already have the materials in your bank, and on the east side if you want to purchase the materials from the [[Ore seller.|ore seller]] or the Grand Exchange, for faster minecart access. If you fail a task and are unable to obtain a new one, logging out and logging back in should fix the issue.\n\nThe companies are:\n*[[The Green Gemstone]]\n*[[The White Chisel]]\n*[[The Silver Cog]]\n*[[The Brown Engine]]\n*[[The Yellow Fortune]]\n*[[The Blue Opal]]\n*[[The Purple Pewter]]\n*[[The Red Axe]] ''(you cannot join this company)''\n\nTalk to the secretary of the company that you want to work for. You will be given several errands to collect 1-5 of a certain ''un-noted'' material within a time limit. The possible items are [[clay]], [[copper ore]], [[tin ore]], [[iron ore]], [[silver ore]], [[gold ore]], [[mithril ore]], and [[coal]]. With the exception of clay, all materials can be mined or bought nearby, if they are not already in your bank or inventory. You can say \"no,\" then talk to the secretary again to receive a new task (for instance, if you don't have clay or a way to easily get it, just get a new task).\n\nA hidden scoring system determines your progress with a company; each ore delivery completed gives 20 points, while failing or cancelling a task subtracts 2 points. Players who join [[The Purple Pewter]] can get a head start of 20 points if speaking to the [[Purple Pewter Secretary]] whilst wearing [[H.A.M. robes]].\n\nOnce you reach 75 points, you will be told that the director of the company wants to speak with you. At this point you may start doing errands for the director, who will request different items from you. These items include [[bronze bars]], [[iron bars]], [[steel bars]], [[silver bars]], [[gold bars]], and [[mithril bars]], and give 12 points per delivery.\n\n'''{{Colour|red|Warning}}:''' Ensure you perform tasks only for the company you want to choose, as the progress for each is separate and will therefore be wasted.\n\nWhen you have have obtained 100 points for a company, you can ask the director to officially join them, and they will agree and accept you as a \"trusted associate\". Next, tell them that [[Blasidar the sculptor|Blasidar]] sent you, and that you will vouch for them at the next Consortium meeting.\n\n===Art by committee===\nReturn to [[Commander Veldaban]] (west of the bank) and tell him you will go to the meeting. You will see a cutscene of about 4 minutes. You can also skip the cutscene by refusing to go to the meeting; you can read a summary of it in the [[meeting notes]], received after completing the quest.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nThe Giant Dwarf statue.png|The completed statue, in this case resembling the director of the Green Gemstone or Silver Cog.\nBlue opal dwarf.png|The completed statue, in this case resembling the director of the Blue Opal.\nConsortium Meeting.png|Hreidmar storms out of the Consortium meeting.\n</gallery>\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Giant Dwarf\n|image = [[File:The Giant Dwarf reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Mining|2,500}} [[Mining]] experience\n*{{SCP|Smithing|2,500}} [[Smithing]] experience\n*{{SCP|Crafting|2,500}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*{{SCP|Magic|1,500}} [[Magic]] experience\n*{{SCP|Thieving|1,500}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{SCP|Firemaking|1,500}} [[Firemaking]] experience\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of The Giant Dwarf is required for the following:\n*[[Another Slice of H.A.M.]]\n*[[Forgettable Tale...]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 9 November 2022\n|update = Diversity & Inclusion Changes and Quest Speedrunning Updates\n|change = The gender restrictions on joining the Brown Engine or Yellow Fortune company were lifted as part of the [[Diversity & Inclusion updates]].\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = \n|update = \n|change = [[The Consortium (music track)|The Consortium]] [[music]] track now unlocks when the final meeting cutscene is skipped.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 6 February 2014\n|update = Quick-prayers & Loot Broadcast\n|change = The statue in The Giant Dwarf no longer has huge vertical gaps between its component parts.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The cutscene between the Consortium leaders at the end of the quest takes place in a static, non-instanced room; a glimpse of one of these rooms can be seen during normal gameplay from the third room of [[Pyramid Plunder]]. This is because at the time of the quest's development, Jagex was unable to create [[instance]]d areas for cutscenes, even though [[The Lost Tribe]], another quest released on the same day but went into development later than The Giant Dwarf, was the first use of an instance in the game.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1162261891537707008|date=16 August 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/19tgw|archivedate=16 August 2019|quote=Sort of. Before developers could generate instanced copies of areas on demand, cutscenes had to take place in static copies of the map, and you're seeing one of those.}}{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1644084798091153411|date=16 August 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/JHEqx|archivedate=8 April 2023|quote=Yeah, Giant Dwarf went into development considerably earlier, being a bigger project due to the city being created as part of it. By the time Lost Tribe went into development, instances were available to be used. Mod Vincent would otherwise have appreciated them!}}\n** As a result, there are sixteen distinct cutscene rooms (four for each floor the game possesses) in which the player can be assigned to. If a seventeenth player attempts to enter a cutscene whilst all sixteen cutscene rooms are occupied, [[Commander Veldaban]] will tell the player that the Consortium either has \"other important business to attend to\", or that the meeting hasn't started yet. The exact conditions to what he says can be found in the [[Transcript:The Giant Dwarf#Talking to Commander Veldaban|quest's transcript]].\n*There was a graphical glitch that appeared during the cutscenes that shows a closeup up the Giant Dwarf statue: the body appeared to be floating above the legs, and the head (once it had been added) was floating above the body.\n*If you talk to Dromund's Cat while wearing a catspeak amulet, he mentions he used to be friends with the Red Axe cat.\n*When asking Santiri about battleaxes, he offers you a blue or red one, saying \"red is on the rise\". This is a reference to the name of the quest series, Rise of the Red Axe.\n*When speaking to Santiri about repairing the axe, his dialogue acknowledges if the player has 99 Smithing. \"The axe is beyond repair, even for a master such as you.\"\n*Near the beginning of the meeting, Hreidmar interrupts the argument by saying 'This bickering is pointless'. This is likely a reference to Governor Tarkin in ''{{Wp|Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope}}''.\n*Completing The Giant Dwarf quest before choosing the statue's head in the [[Enakhra's Lament]] quest unlocks additional dialogue with [[Lazim]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Giant Dwarf}}\n{{Keldagrim}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Giant Dwarf, The}}"

They will say that the [[goblin]] race is on the brink of civil war over armour colour, and they want their armour to be orange which is different to their normal colour.\n\n===Gathering the required items===\n'''''<u>Skip this subsection if you already have the items required.</u>'''''\n\nAsk the generals where you can get orange armour. Eventually, one will answer that you can dye [[Goblin mail]] orange. [[Grubfoot]] will mention he stole yellow dye from a witch in [[Draynor Village]], and mentions you may be able to find it there. One of the generals will mention you can find goblin mail in three different crates around the village.\nGrab the suits of goblin mail from the following crates:\n*Behind the generals' hut in a crate.\n*Inside the western hut in between the small square hut and the generals' hut.\n*Up a ladder near the gate to the goblin village.\n''Note: DO NOT dye 3 pieces of armour. You only want 1 blue and 1 orange. Leave one plain. If you mistakenly paint an armour you won't get new ones from the crates.''\n\nAlternatively, goblin mail can be obtained as a drop from killing [[goblin]]s. The goblins in [[Goblin Village]] drop red or green goblin mails, which can be dyed, but you will need one uncoloured one from a standard goblin. You can go up the only ladder in the goblin village, up there will be some crates, search them to find a brown goblin mail.\n\n[[Wyson]] the head gardener in [[Falador Park]] will sell you the needed [[woad leaves]]. Ask him if you can buy some. When you do, he'll ask how much you are willing to pay. Say, \"<u>About 20 coins</u>,\" and he'll say you are generous and will give you two woad leaves. This is the cheapest option.\n\nTwo [[onion]]s can easily be picked from the field just north of [[Rimmington]], or alternate places such as [[Lumbridge]], in the backyard of [[Farmer Fred]]'s farm, which is next to the sheep paddock.\n\nThree [[redberries]] can be purchased from [[Wydin's Food Store]] in [[Port Sarim]] for 3 coins each or picked west of [[Varrock]]'s [[South-east Varrock mine|south-east mine]].\n\n===Making the dyes===\n'''''<u>Skip this subsection if you already have [[Orange dye]] and [[Blue dye]].</u>'''''\n\nYou need to make orange dye and blue dye from the components you gathered in the previous section. Take the supplies to [[Aggie]] in [[Draynor Village]], and have her make one [[yellow dye|yellow]], one [[red dye|red]], and one blue dye. To make orange dye, use the yellow dye and red dye on each other in your inventory.\n\n===The generals' verdict===\n[[File:Goblin Diplomacy - Grubfoot cutscene.png|thumb|Grubfoot trying the orange goblin mail.]]\nDye one [[Goblin mail]] orange, one blue, and leave the last one unaltered.\n\nGo back to [[Goblin Village]], and give the orange goblin mail to the generals. They will have [[Grubfoot]] try it on, and say they do not like it. They will ask for blue armour. Give them the blue goblin mail. Again, they will have Grubfoot try it on, and again, it is rejected. They now want brown. Give them the plain brown goblin mail. Grubfoot tries it on for the last time. They decide that the original colour, brown, is best after all.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Reward==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Goblin Diplomacy\n|image = [[File:Goblin Diplomacy reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 5\n|rewards = \n* {{SCP|Crafting|200}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*A [[gold bar]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Goblin Diplomacy is required for the following:\n*[[Recipe for Disaster/Freeing the Goblin generals]]\n*[[The Lost Tribe]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* Until 17 July 2006, the quest was originally started by talking to the [[Bartender (Rusty Anchor Inn)|bartender]] in Port Sarim.

To get there, use the [[Necklace of Passage]] teleport to Eagles' Eyrie. At the teleport location, you can complete several easy and medium [[Desert Diary]] tasks before heading south-east towards the ruins where the quest is located. Some of these tasks include:\n\n* Stealing a [[Phoenix Feather]] from the [[Desert Phoenix]] for both a medium Desert Diary task and use in the quest itself\n* Catching a [[Golden warbler|Golden Warbler]] with a [[Bird snare|Bird Snare]] (requiring Level 5 Hunter) for an easy Desert Diary task\n* Mining 5 pieces of [[clay]] for an easy Desert Diary task (4 of which can be used in the quest itself but require a method such as mining it with a bracelet of clay to turn it into [[soft clay]])\n* Filling a [[Waterskin]] with water by cutting a Khardian cactus with a [[knife]] for an easy Desert Diary task\n\nAlternatively, take [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|dlq}} and run north-east.

The desert phoenix can also be found nearby.}}\n\n===Repairing the golem===\n{{Needed|4 [[soft clay]] '''or''' a [[bracelet of clay]] and a [[pickaxe]]|recommended=[[Digsite pendant]] or [[Digsite teleport]], a woodcutting axe and a [[Bird Snare]]}}\nThe first thing you should do is repair the broken clay golem. If you did not bring your own [[clay]], go north-west and mine four pieces of clay while wearing a [[bracelet of clay]] to mine [[soft clay]] (mine one more clay to complete the Easy Desert Diary task). If a bracelet of clay is not used, you can use the [[jug of water]] found in the town with the oasis south of the Ruins of Uzer to combine it with the mined [[clay]] to create [[soft clay]] for use with repairing the golem (world hopping is recommended to get additional jugs of water faster).\n\nAs you use the soft clay on the broken clay golem, he will become less damaged and finally be repaired. He will tell you that he was programmed to destroy a powerful demon, [[Thammaron]]. You need to help him slay the demon. '''Make sure to ask him how to open the portal'''. Outside the temple ruins, near the golem, there is a [[Letter (The Golem)|letter]]. Take the letter and read it.\n\nHead east into the temple by climbing down the stairs behind the golem. Once inside, pick two [[black mushroom]]s nearby the entrance (one for the quest and one for the quest's sequel, [[Shadow of the Storm]]). Then head to the north-west corner of the room and pick up the [[strange implement]]. The implement is also used during Shadow of the Storm, so it is advised to keep it as well.\n\nAdditionally, if you have Level 35 Woodcutting and brought a woodcutting axe: you can complete a [[Medium Desert Diary|medium Desert Diary task]] by cutting the nearby [[Teak tree|Teak Tree]] behind the ruins indicated by the tree icon on the minimap.\n\n===The Digsite===\n{{Map|name=Elissa|x=3374|y=3434|r=4|mtype=square|align=left|width=240|height=240|caption=The location of Elissa.}}\nGo to the [[Digsite]] east of [[Varrock]]. Quick ways of getting to the digsite are using a Digsite pendant/teleport or the [[gnome glider]]. Find [[Elissa]] in the north-eastern part of the Digsite, She is wearing yellow and brown robes. Tell her you found a letter with her name on it. She will tell you about her late husband's notes and where they are located. After talking to her, go to the [[Exam Centre]] and search the south-eastern most bookshelf. You will find [[Varmen's notes]]. Read them before progressing.\n[[File:The Golem - stealing statuette.png|thumb|224px|The player steals the statuette.]]\n\nGo to the [[Varrock Museum]] and ask [[Curator Haig Halen]] on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} about a missing statuette. You must have the strange implement in your inventory to ask the Curator about the statuette. Then, [[pickpocket]] him to get a [[display cabinet key]]. Unlock the display case upstairs to steal the [[statuette (The Golem)|statuette]]. It is on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} in the first row of display cases and the fourth case after you ascend the stairs (display case 30).\n\n'''Note:''' If you lose the statuette, you can use the display cabinet key on the empty display cabinet to receive a new one.\n{{Clear|left}}\n===Returning to Uzer===\n{{Needed|An empty [[vial]], [[pestle and mortar]], [[statuette (The Golem)|statuette]], black mushroom (obtainable in Uzer dungeon), Strange implement, [[papyrus]], [[Phoenix feather]] (obtainable near the clay mines north of [[Uzer]]), [[chisel]] and [[hammer]] (optional, for cutting [[gems]]).}}\n\n[[File:The Golem - desert phoenix.png|thumb|left|210px|The Desert Phoenix, near the clay mine.]]\nBefore going back to Uzer, make sure you have the required items listed above in your inventory. If you don't, there's a [[bank]] just south of the museum.\n\nHead towards the ruins of Uzer from the [[Shantay Pass]] or through the {{Fairycode|dlq}} [[fairy ring]].\n\n[[File:The Golem - the alcove.png|thumb|200px|The alcove in the centre where the statuette goes.]]\n[[File:The Golem - Thammaron's remains.png|thumb|200px|The dead demon.]]\nAt Uzer, enter the dungeon near the golem and go to the middle. Use the statuette on the empty alcove on the wall. Turn all of them north to face towards the [[Door (Ruins of Uzer)|double doors]] to unlock the demon's lair. The east statues should face right and the west statues should face left when the player examines them. The statues will lock and the doors will automatically open. Go inside to discover that [[Thammaron]] had perished from his wounds from the battle long ago. Should you wish to do so, use your chisel and hammer on the [[Throne (Thammaron's throne room)|throne]] to get six gems that you can keep. Go outside and talk to the clay golem again. He was not programmed to believe that the demon is dead, so you'll need to reprogram him.\n\nWith an empty vial in your inventory, use your pestle and mortar on the black mushroom to make black mushroom ink. Use the phoenix feather on your ink to make a [[phoenix quill pen]], then use it on your papyrus to write a [[Golem program]]. Go back to the clay golem. Use the strange implement and then the golem program on him to get your reward.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Golem\n|image = [[File:The Golem reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Thieving|1,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{SCP|Crafting|1,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*2 cut [[Ruby|rubies]], [[emerald]]s, and [[sapphire]]s (collect these by using a [[chisel]] and [[hammer]] on the [[Throne (Thammaron's throne room)|throne]])\n*Unlock the carpet ride from [[Shantay Pass]] to [[Uzer]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of The Golem is required for the following:\n*[[Shadow of the Storm]]\n*[[Medium Desert Diary]]\n*[[Recipe for Disaster]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n{{The Golem}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Golem, The}}"

(Be sure to have 2 empty inventory slots) He will take you underground and ask you for your help reviving the Grand Tree, which is ill, and give you a [[translation book]] and a [[bark sample]]. \n\nTake both these items to [[Hazelmere]]. He can be found on a small island east of [[Yanille]]. There are [[jungle spider]]s (level 44) on the way to his house, although they are not [[poison]]ous. There are several ways to reach him easily:\n*The [[Watchtower Teleport]].\n*The [[Grouping]] [[teleport]] to the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n*The [[Grouping]] [[teleport]] to the [[Fishing Trawler]].\n*If your player-owned house ([[Player-owned house|POH]]) is in Yanille, you can cast [[Teleport to House]].\n*The [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|CLS}} brings you right next to his house.\n*Use the ring of dueling teleport to Castle Wars and make your way East.\n*Or you may also take a [[charter ship]] to Port Khazard and make your way South.\n*Players with the [[Ardougne cloak 1]] can teleport to the [[Kandarin Monastery]], north of [[Yanille]].\n\n===Hazelmere===\n{{Needed|[[Bark sample]]|recommended=[[Ring of dueling]], [[necklace of passage]] for teleportation to the [[Outpost]]}}\n\nTalk to [[Hazelmere]]. You cannot understand his language and vice versa, but you can communicate with the help of sign language regardless. He will take your [[bark sample]], and after examining it, he will give you a [[Hazelmere's scroll|message]]. When translated using the [[translation book]] it reads\n\n{{Cquote2|A man came to me with the King's seal.<br/>I gave the man [[Daconia stone|Daconia rocks]].<br/>And Daconia rocks will kill the tree!}}\n\nReturn to King Narnode in the [[Grand Tree]], and tell him the message above. He will ask what the translation is in three lines, so pick each line from the choices offered. If none of the options match, select the ''\"None of the above\"'' option until the correct option presents itself. For the first line, you have to go to the third set of choices offered. He will explain that someone used his seal to have [[Hazelmere]] give away [[Daconia rock]]s, which were made as a \"fail-safe\" and can kill the tree. He will direct you to talk to [[Glough]], his head tree guardian. \n{{Map|x=2477|y=3463|r=3|width=250|height=250|mtype=square|align=right|caption=Glough's house location.}}\nGlough is located south of the [[Grand Tree]], east of the ramp, in a tree house. He will tell you that he will take care of the problem.\n\n===Investigation===\n{{Needed|1,000 [[coins]] (if you haven't helped [[Femi]])|recommended=[[Teleport]] out of [[Karamja]]}}\n\n'''Tip:''' If you have completed the [[Tree Gnome Village]] quest, you can use a [[Spirit tree (Construction)|Spirit tree]] as teleportation. bring with you runes to teleport to [[Varrock]] and use the [[spirit tree]] at the [[Grand Exchange]], This will come in handy.\n\nReturn to [[King Narnode Shareen]]. He will tell you that [[Glough]] has caught and imprisoned a human, who was found carrying the [[Daconia rock]]s. Ask to see the prisoner. Talk to [[King Narnode Shareen]] again, and he will tell you that the prisoner is located on the top floor of the [[Grand Tree]].\n[[File:The Grand Tree - Talking to Charlie.png|thumb|220px|Talking to Charlie.]]\nThe prisoner, whose name is [[Charlie (prisoner)|Charlie]], will tell you that he had [[Hazelmere]] give the Daconia rocks to him, though he was only doing as [[Glough]] asked him to do. He tells you to search Glough's house for evidence. Go to Glough's house. Search the [[cupboard (The Grand Tree)|cupboard]], and you will find his journal. Talk to Glough, who then orders the guards at you. After the conversation, you will be put in the cell next to Charlie's. Talk to Charlie, he will tell you about the [[Ship Yard]] on [[Karamja]], and give you the password to access it, which is '''Ka-Lu-Min'''.\n\n[[King Shareen|The king]] will appear and apologise for Glough imprisoning you. He will tell you that guards are watching the entrances, and tells you to quickly escape on the [[Gnome glider]] on the top floor of the [[Grand Tree]], next to the cells. Talk to the pilot. He will ask you where you want to go and you will ask him to fly you to [[Karamja]].\n\n===Karamja===\nThe glider will crash land just west of the Ship Yard. Run east past the level 53 [[jogre]]s, they could attack you''(so be wary of this if you're a low level)''. Once you reach the Ship Yard attempt to open the gate. A [[shipyard worker]] will stop you. Tell him Glough sent you. He will ask for a password (Charlie told you it is): '''Ka-Lu-Min'''. After confirming the correct password he'll let you open the gate.\n\nGo out to the southern docks and you'll find the [[foreman]]. Once you find him you have two choices. You kill him (he is a level 23), or you talk to him. Both will result in you getting proof of Glough's plans. \n\n'''If you choose to talk'''. Tell him Glough sent you. He will then take you somewhere private. You'll need to answer some personal questions about Glough.\n\nHe will ask how his wife is, select \"'''Sadly his wife is no longer with us'''\".\nHe will then ask what his favourite dish is, select \"'''Worm holes'''\".\nFinally, he will ask for his new girlfriend's name, which is \"'''Anita'''\". \n\nOnce you've made your choice and you've got the [[lumber order]], return to [[The Grand Tree]]. If you have completed the [[Tree Gnome Village]] quest, either Teleport to [[Varrock]] and use the [[Spirit tree (Construction)|spirit tree]] at the [[Grand Exchange]], or use [[Ardougne cloak 1]] or higher and run northwest to the spirit tree to teleport you to [[Tree Gnome Stronghold|Gnome stronghold]].\n\nIf you haven't completed the [[Tree Gnome Village]] quest then make your way to the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]] [[gate (Tree Gnome Stronghold)|front gate]] and talk to [[Femi]]. Tell her you need to get inside, and she will sneak you in. If you haven't helped her previously, she will charge you 1,000 coins. If you have, she will help you for free.\n\n:'''Note:''' If you've never used the Stronghold entrance before (i.e. you've always gotten in via a Spirit Tree), Femi will say that you helped her and let you in for free.\n\n===Tuzo===\n{{Needed|[[Lumber order]]}}\n\nAfter you show [[King Shareen|the king]] the [[Lumber order|note]] from the [[foreman]], he still will not believe your accusations, call you as paranoid as [[Glough]], and ask you to leave for your own safety.\n{{Map|x=2391|y=3511|r=3|width=250|height=250|align=right|caption=Anita's house on the map.|mtype=square}}\nSpeak to [[Charlie]] again on the top floor of the [[Grand Tree]]. He will suggest you speak to [[Anita]], Glough's girlfriend. Go and talk to her. She is in the second house west to the swamp, you have to go upstairs. She will give you a [[Glough's key|key]] and ask you to return it to Glough.\n[[File:The Grand Tree - Opening the chest.png|thumb|left|220px|Opening the chest for the notes.]]\nGo to Glough's house, and use the key to open the chest. Inside, you will find some of his [[Invasion plans|notes]] detailing his plan to seize control of [[Gielinor]]. After you pick them up they are called \"Invasion plans\" in your inventory. Click \"Continue\" otherwise you won't get the notes. \n\n'''Note:''' You must have at least 4 free inventory space before you do the next step.\n\nTake the notes to King Shareen. He will still not believe your evidence. He will tell you that in their search of Glough's house all they found were four bundles of [[twigs]]. They spell out the word ''TUZO''. Using the [[Translation book]], this translates to \"open.\" The King will give you all four bundles of twigs.[[File:The Grand Tree - Using the twigs.png|thumb|Using the twigs on the pillars.]]\nReturn to Glough's house, and climb up the watchtower. This tree is located on the east side of the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} and requires 25 [[Agility]] to climb. Up in the watchtower, you will find a stone stand and four pillars. Use the twigs with the four pillars to spell out ''TUZO'', starting from the far left. After you have placed the twigs on the four pillars, you will hear gears turning. You can now open the trap door on this platform, '''but do not go in yet unless you are prepared for the fight.'''\n\n===Encountering the Black demon===\n{{Needed|[[Combat]] [[equipment]] and [[food]] to last in a fight against a level 172 [[Black demon (The Grand Tree)|Black demon]]}}\n\nAfter you enter the trapdoor, [[Glough]] will come and talk to you, threatening you with his plans to wipe out humans.\n\n:'''Note:''' Interacting with ''anything'' except for the dialogue and examines during the conversation, or not completing the conversation, will cause Glough to return you to the platform with him instructing you to listen to him when he talks. Re-enter the trap door to restart the dialogue.\n\nAfter the conversation concludes, a level 172 [[Black demon (The Grand Tree)|black demon]] will appear to the west and attack you.\n\nIt can be fought with any combat style, but can be [[safespot]]ted with [[Ranged]], [[Magic]] or a [[halberd]]. To safespot, stand where Glough is during the fight, if the black demon can still attack you, move back behind another rock until he can no longer attack you. You can also go into the tunnel to the west to where the demon cannot reach and safely attack him using ranged or magical attacks. He can also be safespotted by standing north of the ladder. The Black Demon has very low magic and negative magic defence bonus, and has a 40% [[Elemental weakness|weakness]] to water spells; as such, it's recommended for low level players should use the highest tier water spell they can use and afford.\n\n:'''Note:''' If the demon is not killed within 10 minutes, it will '''disappear''' and the battle needs to be '''restarted'''. To do so, walk through the tunnel and leave through the ladder next to [[King Narnode Shareen]], and re-enter Glough's trapdoor.\n\n:'''For 10HP Pures:''' With [[Bind]], it is possible to kill the demon with a cannon.  When the scene begins, use Bind on the demon immediately and set up the cannon just 2-3 spaces west of the ladder you used to enter. You will know the cannon is in the right area if you can reload it from safespot 1. Bind might wear off before you can finish setting up, but if you die, the cannon will remain. Once the cannon is going, it will fire at all the rats in the room as well. If it hits a rat without killing it, that rat will  aggro onto you and it may end up in a position where the cannon can't reach it. When this happens the cannon will cease firing. To break the aggro with the rat you will either have to step into the tile north of the ladder for a few seconds or you will have wait for the demon's aggro to break and then you can lure the rat to a tile the cannon can reach. Bring at least 120 cannonballs\n\n:{{Colour|Red|Warning}}: The second safespot pictured below is '''dangerous''' for [[Ironman_Mode#Hardcore|Hardcore Ironmen]], or those with low [[Hitpoints]], due to the likelihood of being drawn into melee range and the [[Black demon (The Grand Tree)|Black demon]] having a max hit of '''16'''.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Black demon (The Grand Tree, 1) safespot.png|Safespot 1: The recommended safespot located directly north of the entrance ladder.\nFile:Black demon (The Grand Tree, 2) safespot.png|Safespot 2: The safespot where Glough stands.

Only works with [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. It will get at least one attack on the player.\n</gallery>\n\n===The adamant king===\nAfter defeating the demon, walk along the passage until you find [[King Shareen]] standing by a ladder. Talk to him and tell him that Glough had sent a demon to attack you, but he will not believe you. He finally sends a guard to scout for Glough, to which the guard comes back with Glough, who was hiding amongst the stones. The king apologises, and asks you to locate the last [[Daconia rock]].\n\n'''Note:''' You will need one empty space in your inventory for the next part.\n\nSearch the [[Root (The Grand Tree)|roots]] all around the area until you find the Daconia rock. Though it can be time-consuming, you might need to search all of the roots. If you somehow lose the rock, it'll spawn in the root where you first found it.\n\nWhen the dialogue pops up stating that you found the stone, click continue or it won't appear in your inventory. After obtaining the rock, talk to King Shareen again for your reward for saving the Grand Tree.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Grand Tree\n|image = [[File:The Grand Tree reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 5\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Attack|18,400}} [[Attack]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Agility|7,900}} [[Agility]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Magic|2,150}} [[Magic]] [[experience]]\n*Access to the [[Grand Tree mine|mine]] under the [[Grand Tree]].\n*Access to the [[Gnome glider]] transportation system.\n*Ability to use the [[Agility shortcut]] from the Grand Tree to the [[Barbarian Outpost]] (with 37 [[Agility]]).\n*Ability to use the Spirit Tree in the Stronghold after the completion of [[Tree Gnome Village]].\n*Completing this quest awards the player with 5 [[Kudos]] which can be claimed by talking to [[Historian Minas]] in the [[Varrock Museum]].\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Black demon]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of The Grand Tree is required for the following:\n*[[Monkey Madness I]]\n*[[The Eyes of Glouphrie]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 21 April 2021\n|update = Fishing Trawler Improvements and Equipment Rebalance: Part One\n|change = Dialogue and quest progression in The Grand Tree quest has been improved.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 25 April 2013\n|update = Patch Notes (25 April 2013)\n|change = The Grand Tree showdown with the Black demon now works like a cutscene.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n{{The Grand Tree}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Grand Tree, The}}"

To get there, use a [[Mos le'harmless teleport]], a [[Trouble Brewing]] mini-game teleport, or talk to [[Bill Teach]] on his boat in [[Port Phasmatys]] at the east end of the dock near the Green Ghost Inn and agree to sail to [[Mos Le'Harmless]].\n\nNear the dock, you will notice a rather sickly-looking monk named [[Brother Tranquility]]. Talk to him to begin the quest — select the option regarding undead pirates. He will explain how some of his fellow monks are in trouble and ask for help. Accept the offer to be teleported to [[Harmony Island]].\n\n===Gathering info===\n[[File:Moving Saradomin statue.png|thumb|Moving the statue.]]\n''When doing the Hard [[Morytania Diary]], you can plant your [[watermelon seed]]s now, so you can harvest them at the end of the quest.''\n\nMake sure you have the supplies listed earlier and head outside the windmill. [[Zombie pirate (Harmony Island)|Zombie pirates]] (level 57) are [[aggressive]] and will attack. A short way to the north will be a [[Saradomin]] [[Statue (The Great Brain Robbery)|statue]] that can be pulled. Pull the statue. Go down the hole and into a tunnel. It is full of water, so equip the diving gear to submerge beneath the water. Note that you cannot enter the water if you are carrying a follower such as a pet cat. Run past the zombie pirates and repair the stairs at the far end of the tunnel (you can be attacked while repairing the stairs and it takes a while). Go up them, climb up the ladder in the next room; then, look through the [[peephole]] to spy on the enemy.\n[[File:Peeking through hole.png|thumb|left|The secret room, peek through the hole.]]\n\n===The prayer book===\n{{Needed|[[Holy symbol]].|recommended=charged [[Combat bracelet]] or [[Amulet of glory]] (teleport to [[Edgeville]]), [[Mos le'harmless teleport]] or [[Ectophial]].}}\nReport back to [[Brother Tranquility]]. He will suggest getting a book that can be used to pray away [[poison]]. Travel to the [[Monastery]] near [[Edgeville]] to find the [[prayer book]] in a bookshelf towards the south-west corner of the building on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}. Read the book, which provides instructions on how to use it. Equip a [[holy symbol]] and return to [[Harmony Island]] by talking to [[Brother Tranquility]]. The zombies have begun to gas the windmill, so right-click the book and select \"recite-prayer.\" After this, make sure to talk to Brother Tranquility.\n\n===The doctor===\n{{Needed|[[Ring of charos]], 10 wooden cats (or the materials to make them), ~50 nails, 4 [[plank]]s, hammer|recommended=[[Ectophial]], Runes for 2 [[Fenkenstrain's Castle Teleport]]s or 2 [[Fenkenstrain's castle teleport (tablet)|tablet equivalents]], [[Kharyrll teleport (tablet)|Kharyll tab]] (if [[Desert Treasure I]] has been completed), [[armour]], [[food]], [[weapon]] and/or [[Wolfbane dagger]].}}\n\n[[File:Great Brain Robbery Elfinlocks.png|210px|thumb|[[Elfinlocks]] makes another cameo appearance.]]\nNow that the monks are no longer in danger of being [[poisoned]], they would like to get their brains back in their bodies where they belong. Travel to [[Dr Fenkenstrain]] in [[Fenkenstrain's Castle|his castle]], climb up either stairs, and then climb up the ladder in the jail cell in the middle of the room. After a bit of negotiation, he agrees that a new home free of the threat of being eaten sounds better than where he is. However, he does not want to risk being eaten while travelling. He is also allergic to teleportation, so another way needs to be found.\n\nGo to [[Canifis]] and talk to [[Rufus]], the owner of the meat store north of the bank, about another meat shipment. Make sure to be wearing the [[ring of charos]] while talking to him. Rufus will give you some [[crate part]]s and a [[wolf whistle]]. You need to build ten decoy cats to fill the crate since Rufus assumes the crate will be transporting cats.\n\n'''''Tip:''' Since you are right next to a bank, deposit the whistle and crate parts and take out Mos Le'Harmless teleport (treasure trail), 10 wooden [[plank]]s, 10 pieces of [[fur]], and a [[hammer]] — [[home teleport]] runes or tab and an [[ectophial]] are advised for easy travelling. If you do not have a Clockmaker's bench yet, you will also need to bring 4 [[oak plank]]s and a [[saw]]. Also, if you still need fur, you can kill [[Canifis villager]]s—they'll transform into level 88 [[werewolves]] if you don't use [[Wolfbane]], so be careful. You can also obtain fur by thieving from stalls in Ardougne (or trading the fur trader there) or by purchasing fur in Varrock square for 20 coins apiece. Ultimate ironmen may find a table in the south-west tower of Fenkenstrain's castle on the first floor helpful.''\n\n[[File:Great Brain Robbery crate.png|thumb|left|Building the delivery crate.]]\nTravel to a [[player-owned house]] that has a Clockmaker's bench. Craft the materials into 10 [[wooden cat]]s. Grab your ring of charos, the 10 wooden cats, 4 planks (normal), a hammer, ~50 [[nails]], the crate parts, and the wolf whistle before travelling back to Fenkenstrain's castle.\nReturn to [[Dr Fenkenstrain]] and build the crate on the crate hotspot. Then use the extra (normal) planks of wood to build a false bottom by clicking on the crate again and selecting \"add-bottom.\" Fill it with the fake cats and then use the wolf whistle Rufus gave you to call him. Fenkenstrain will automatically get in the crate. \n\n'''''Tip:''' You can't blow the Wolf whistle if you are still wearing the Fishbowl helmet.''\n\nOnce past inspection, Rufus will give you a [[shipping order]]. Use this on the crate, and it will be ''teleported'' to the island.\n\n===Making the transplants===\n{{Needed|Hammer, fishbowl helmet, diving apparatus|recommended=Weapon, armour to kill 4 Sorebones (safespottable), Salve Amulet}}\nNow that the doctor is on the island, travel back to [[Mos Le'Harmless]]. Use the island bank to grab a [[hammer]], diving gear, [[armour]], and a [[weapon]] before teleporting to [[Harmony Island]]. [[Dr Fenkenstrain]] is in the basement of the windmill and needs some equipment to perform the surgery. He will give you a list of items to collect:\n\n*[[Brain tongs]]\n*[[Cranial clamp]]\n*3 [[bell jar]]s\n*30 [[skull staple]]s\n*A [[hammer]]\n\nLuckily, the bad guys already have what you need since they performed the surgery in the first place. The only problem is how to get inside the building.[[File:Blowing up the door.gif|frame|right|The player creates an explosion to open the door.]]\nPut on the diving suit to avoid passing out from the gas, and head north from the windmill to the ship beached nearby. Search the [[locker (The Great Brain Robbery)|locker]] on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} to get a [[Fuse (The Great Brain Robbery)|fuse]]; then, climb up a level and get a [[tinderbox]] and a [[keg]] of powder. With these in hand, go back to the front door of the monastery. Use the keg in the front door, add a fuse, and then, light it. The door is now open.\n\n[[File:The Great Brain Robbery cat cutscene.png|thumb|right|250px|The gruesome operation, replaced with a cute cat playing with a ball.]]\nOnce inside, kill the 4 [[Sorebones]] to obtain all the needed equipment, which can be safespotted behind benches. You must pick up the dropped items after each kill, or else you will just get duplicates. Walk back to the windmill, head downstairs, and give all this to Dr Fenkenstrain to begin the gruesome surgery. A cutscene of a cute cat playing with a ball will ensue due to the surgery being too gruesome. Make sure to speak to [[Brother Tranquility]] after the operation.\n\nNote, the Sorebones are considered [[Undead]] and thus a [[Salve amulet]] will work against them.\n\n===The big battle===\n{{Instance}}\nReturn to the bank on [[Mos Le'Harmless]] and grab all the [[armour]], [[food]], and [[potions]] you will need for the fight. '''Note:''' You still need to wear your diving suit. The Barrelchest is '''NOT''' considered [[Undead]] meaning the [[Salve amulet]] will not provide a benefit against him.\n\nGo back to Harmony. \n\nWhen you enter the monastery, only [[Mi-Gor]] will be there, giving you the option to confront him. When you do, he will summon his monstrosity, a giant mess of machinery named [[Barrelchest]], to attack you.\n\n[[File:Barrelchest safespot.png|thumb|250px|left|Safespotting the barrelchest.]]\n{{Listen\n|title = [[Brain Battle]]\n|desc = The music which plays while battling the Barrelchest.\n|filename = Brain Battle.ogg\n}}\n[[Prayer]] (and also Defence) drains faster than usual during the fight, and Barrelchest will turn your Prayers off.\n\nIf meleeing, just keep turning prayer back on ('''''note''': repeatedly turning it on can be a huge time waste and result in death if he gets lucky with the timing of his hits, plan to do this without prayer to avoid that)''. Bringing several [[prayer potion]]s and at least ten good food is highly recommended. Barrelchest is a fairly blunt instrument; he will not use anything but [[Melee]] attacks, which are fairly slow and inaccurate; however, when he does hit, he tends to frequently hit over 20.\n\nIf [[ranging]] or [[maging]], it is possible to [[safespot]] him: either catch him on the corner of the first pew by taking a few steps back when you first start the battle, or simply exit and then re-enter the monastery after the fight begins and he will immediately be caught if you stay where you are at the entrance. '''DO NOT hide behind a pew when attempting to do this or he will strike the ground with his anchor, dealing up to 25 typeless ranged damage.'''\n\nOnce you have killed Barrelchest, pick up his [[Barrelchest anchor|anchor]] and walk back to the windmill to inform [[Brother Tranquility]] of your victory.\n\nHe will thank you and give you a lamp granting 5,000 experience in the skill of your choice.\n[[File:Barrelchest dies.gif|right|frame|The Barrelchest is defeated!]]\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n''Note: If you died during the boss fight, '''you will need another fishbowl helmet and diving apparatus to recover your items'''.

This is one of ''RuneScape''{{'}}s many references to ''{{Wp|Monty Pyton's Flying Circus|Monty Python}}'', specifically their \"{{Wp|Dead Parrot}}\" sketch.\n**After the player builds the crate and fills it with the wooden cats, the player says \"Urge to kill...rising!\" This is a reference to an episode of ''The Simpsons'' where Homer says the same line.\n**When Dr Fenkenstrain tells you the list of equipment he needs, the player mentions \"Unusual Implements R Us\". This is a reference to the now-defunct toy store {{wp|Toys \"R\" Us}}.\n**\"Not the box\" is a possible reference to the \"Boo Box\" from the film ''{{wp|Hook (film)| Hook}}''.\n**At the beginning of the quest while talking to Brother Tranquility, the player refers to Mos Le'Harmless as \"a hive of scum and villainy\". This is a reference to Ben Kenobi's line describing Mos Eisley in ''{{Wp|Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope}}''.\n**After retrieving the prayer book, Brother Tranquility asks, \"When you took the book from the shelf, did you say the words?\" This is a reference to the cult film ''{{wp|Army of Darkness}}'', where the main character, Ash, is told by a priest to retrieve the ''Necronomicon'' after reciting specific words. After retrieving the book, the priest asks Ash, \"When you removed the Necronomicon from its cradle, did you speak the words?\"\n*The [[Mi-Gor]] character and [[Barrelchest]] monster are probably references to {{Wp|emphysema}}, a fatal lung disease that leaves victims with a \"barrel chest\" and a scary voice.\n*This quest marks the second appearance of [[Elfinlocks]], a fake player from the [[Draynor bank robbery]] plot, who is travelling with her clockwork cat in [[Canifis]]. She appears to have gained another [[blue partyhat]] since her last appearance.\n*When first going to [[Harmony Island]], the player does the \"[[Scared]]\" emote saying that they're afraid of getting hit while transporting. This is a reference to the transportation method used in [[Rum Deal]].\n*Along with the Rowboat hotspot from [[Dragon Slayer II]] and the Coffin hotspot from [[Making Friends with My Arm]], the crate hotspot is one of the few Construction hotspots not located in a player-owned house.\n*If you are wearing the [[fishbowl helmet]] and you blow the whistle to call [[Rufus]], you'll get the following message: ''\"You should take your diving helmet off before you try to blow the whistle\"''.\n*If you get [[random events]] such as the Mysterious Old Man or Dr Jekyll, they will be wearing a fishbowl helmet.\n\n{{The Great Brain Robbery}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Great Brain Robbery, The}}"

He can be found south of the [[player-owned house]] portal. Talk to him, and he will ask you to get two rare items in return for his [[magic beans]]:\n\n*The first item is a [[Griffin feather|feather]] from the griffin, [[Grimgnash]], on [[White Wolf Mountain]]—go north on the east trail.\n*The second is a [[Rupert's helmet|helmet]] from a dwarf named [[Rupert]]—in a tower south-west of the [[Mind Altar]].\n\n==Griffin's feather==\n{{Map|align=right|mtype=line|width=280|height=340|2891,3454|2889,3447|2884,3445|2882,3444|2881,3442|2879,3430|2876,3429|2873,3432|2871,3446|2875,3454|2874,3459|2872,3469|2869,3475|2867,3481|2864,3483|2864,3485|2865,3490|2867,3499|2867,3508|caption=The path to take to see [[Grimgnash]], the griffin.}}\n[[File:Grim Tales - Telling stories.png|right|thumb|250px|Telling a story to Grimgnash, the griffin.]]\nTo reach [[Grimgnash]], proceed to [[White Wolf Mountain]] from [[Taverley]], and follow the path that is located the farthest east along the mountain until you reach two white lines. Go through them, and up the path to reach the NPC.\n\nThe Griffin will state that it cannot get to sleep because of the howling wolves and will threaten to eat the player if he doesn't tell him a bedtime story. Grimgnash says he loves stories with death, fire and destruction. Tell him a bedtime story by selecting the options which sound the most violent:\n\n*''I heard you were a great and mighty Griffin!'' '''(Option 1)'''\n*''There once was a graveyard filled with undead.'' '''(Option 1)'''\n*''There lived a skeleton named Skullrot.'' '''(Option 2)'''\n*''Skullrot was insane!'' '''(Option 4)'''\n*''Skullrot hungrily grabbed the gnome's hair.'' '''(Option 4)'''\n*''Started to strangle the poor gnome.'' '''(Option 3)'''\n*''At this point, you can answer with any of the remaining choices.''\n\nOnce Grimgnash is asleep, steal a [[Griffin feather|feather]] from the pile next to his nest and go back to [[Sylas]].\n\n'''Note:''' If Grimgnash doesn't like your story, he will hit you for 20% of your current hitpoints, rounded up. While this damage CAN kill you, it is very unlikely to do so as you would need to repeatedly tell the wrong story.\n\n==Rupert's helmet==\n===Meeting Rupert===\n{{Needed|boost for [[Thieving]] if below level 58, boost for Agility if below level 59.}}\n[[Rupert the Beard]] can be found in a tower in between [[Goblin Village]] and [[Ice Mountain]]. The quickest way to get there is by casting [[Mind Altar Teleport]] (or using its [[Mind Altar teleport (tablet)|magic tablet equivalent]]) and running southward.\n\nIf you attempt to get in by the door of the tower, a rather snobby-looking [[Miazrqa|princess]] will stop you. In order to get in, you will need to go around the back and climb over the crumbling east wall (58 Thieving required).\n\n[[File:Grim Tales - Rupert the Beard in tower.png|thumb|upright=0.5|Rupert locked away.]]\nNext, talk into the drain pipe, and you will find yourself talking to the dwarf imprisoned at the top of the tower.\n\nTalk to him a second time to find out how to get up the tower, and suggest that you should climb up, and then ask if there is anything up there that can help. He will throw down his beard—climb it (59 [[Agility]] required). Talk to the dwarf who regrettably cannot give you his [[Rupert's helmet|helmet]] as the princess has stolen his armour and locked him in the tower.\n\nHe asks you to talk to Princess [[Miazrqa]], who is north of the tower. Use the right-click 'climb-down' option on [[Rupert]], climb back over the east wall, and talk with Princess Miazrqa. She says that she will happily release the dwarf if you get back her [[Miazrqa's pendant|pendant]], which was stolen by a mouse in her [[Nora T. Hagg|second-cousin's (twice-removed)]] house which is the [[witch's house (location)|witch's house]] in [[Taverley]].\n\nAsk Princess Miazrqa for a [[Door key (Witch's House)|door key]] in order to enter the witch's house, or look under the potted plant just to the left of the front door of the witch's house.\n\n===Miazrqa's pendant===\n{{Needed|leather gloves (optional), 2 tarromin potions (unf) or 2 tarromins and 2 vials of water, door key, boost for Herblore if below level 52.}}\n'''This step is optional. To continue, skip to the next paragraph.''' Go to the basement of the [[witch's house (location)|witch's house]], and wear some [[leather gloves]] to avoid an electric shock from the gate, which can cause 17 damage. (Gloves can be obtained by repeatedly searching the boxes in the basement near the piano. You may also get other junk like [[needle]]s and [[cabbage]]s—keep trying until you get the gloves.) Open the cage door, and search the [[music stand]] to find some [[music sheet]]s for the [[Piano (Witch's House)|piano]]. Read the music sheet—now, you have to play that on the piano.\n\n[[File:Music sheet interface.png|thumb|right|200px|Music sheet]]\nGo to the piano in the basement of the [[witch's house (location)|witch's house]]. This is where it gets tricky if you are not familiar with the piano. You have to play the notes: \"''EFEDCAEGA''\". The first five notes (\"''EFEDC''\") are on the right side of the piano; the next last notes (\"''AEGA''\") are on the left side of the piano. Although the notes are displayed when you hover over them on the left side of the screen, you must remember whether they are lower or upper notes.\n\n*'''Note:''' Counting the keys from right to left, click them in this order: key 5, key 4, key 5, key 6, then 7, 9, 12, 10, 9.\n\nThe compartment will open, and the player will find three items in it: a [[shrinking recipe]], [[to-do list]], and two [[shrunk ogleroot]]s. Read the shrinking recipe, and use your [[tarromin]] with 2 [[vials of water]], and add the ogleroot to both unfinished potions. Go upstairs, and drink one of the [[Shrink-me-quick|potions]] while standing next to the mouse hole in the southern room on the ground floor (no [[cheese]] or [[Magnet (Witch's House)|magnet]] required). The player will suddenly shrink and will enter in the mouse hole.\n\n*'''Note:''' You must keep the second shrinking potion in order to complete the quest.\n*If you lose the shrunk ogleroot, you can kill the [[Experiment No.2|experiments]] in the basement of the witch's house to get them (accessed via the [[manhole (witch's house)|manhole]] in front of the door of the house), or fight these experiments, but then run a few squares away. They will throw ogleroots at you you which will usually appear on the ground. This can be repeated to obtain a large supply of ogleroots. Tarromin can also be obtained from the experiments but they must be killed.\n*If you have 48 Herblore, you can boost it to 52 by eating a [[botanical pie]].\n*If you have a cat on the ground when trying to drink the [[shrink-me-quick]] potion, it will prompt you that \"Being mouse-sized with a cat around may not be such a good idea...\". Having the cat in your inventory makes the potion work as normal.\n\n[[File:Grim Tales - Obtaining Miazrqa's pendant.png|thumb|Finding the pendant.]]\n\n===Mouse hole===\n[[Protect from Melee]] is helpful in this part because of continuous attacks by level 95 [[Mouse|mice]].\n\n'''Warning:''' Do '''NOT''' go into the north-eastern grate, or you will end up sprouting back up and have to make another potion to go back into the initial hole again.\n[[File:Grim Tales - Freedom.png|thumb|left|Rupert is free!]]\nYou will need to go through several nail walls to get to the [[Miazrqa's pendant|pendant]]. These nail walls are four nails stuck closely together on the wall. They are indicated as '''wooden ladders on the mini-map.''' Climb the nail walls to the north on the eastern wall located south of the grate, and then, continue south-west and climb up two sets of nails. Go north-east, and climb down the nails. Head north and climb up the last set of nails, and take the pendant. Return to the tower, and give the pendant to the [[Miazrqa|Princess]]. [[Rupert]] will be set free, and he will give you his [[Rupert's helmet|helmet]]. Head back to [[Sylas]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Sylas and the beanstalk==\n{{Needed|a seed dibber, a watering can (with at least 1 dose), Rupert's helmet and equipment to fight [[Glod]]. Also, bank your follower if you have one out, you won't be able to have it in your inventory either.}}\nTake the [[Magic beans|beans]] [[Sylas]] gives you, and plant them in the special patch south-east of [[Taverley]], near the [[tree patch]]. The signpost reads \"This earth mound has been magically prepared. Please keep off. Farming strictly prohibited. You have been warned!\" A [[seed dibber]] and [[watering can]] are required, which can be obtained from the [[tool leprechaun]] at the nearby tree patch to the north-east, or purchased at a [[farming store]].\nAfter watering the patch, a giant beanstalk will grow extremely fast.\n\n[[File:Grim Tales - Planting magic beans.gif|frame|centre|Planting the magic beans.]]\n\n==The battle==\nGet ready for a fight with a level 138.\n\n{{Instance}}\n\nTake high healing [[food]] and some [[prayer potion]]s. Make sure to keep your second oogleroot/shrink-me-quick potion either in your bank or inventory for after the fight. When you're ready, put on protect from melee and climb up the beanstalk (requires 59 [[Agility]]). You will not be able to have a follower with you, even in your inventory.\n\n[[File:Fighting Glod.png|thumb|right|Fighting the angry [[Glod]].]]\n[[Glod]], a cloud giant, will attack you immediately. He is level 118, but will become level 138 shortly after the battle starts. He is difficult to damage with low [[melee]] as he hits very hard, so [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] are a much better option if you have low melee stats, especially as he is extremely weak to [[Magic]]. The [[Iban's staff (u)|upgraded Iban's staff]] and [[Iban Blast]] is very effective, but do prepare plenty of [[runes]] or range [[ammunition]]. Glod is immune to [[poison]].\n\n'''Be aware:''' Glod will sometimes quake the ground, which drains your [[Prayer]] and turns off protection prayers. He will also sometimes heal himself.\n\nPlayers with combat stats greatly over 70 should have absolutely no problem defeating him as the battle could be done with minimal damage sustained. However it is advised that you prepare as stated above.\n\nUse [[Protect from Melee]] whenever you can. Cast your best [[spell]] or range at a distance while hiding behind a wall. He will sometimes taunt you, causing your character to attack him head on. Whenever this happens, run back to the wall, and turn on Protect from Melee whenever you're within his hitting range. Remember to keep your health high as Glod's melee attack is very accurate and can hit as high as 24.\n===After the battle===\n{{Needed|the other shrinking potion, any axe, boost for Woodcutting if below level 71.}}\nOnce you defeat [[Glod]], he'll drop the [[golden goblin]], as well as an [[uncut ruby]], an [[uncut sapphire]], a [[watering can (4)]], and two [[big bones]]. Take it back to [[Sylas]]. He will ask you to chop the beanstalk down (71 [[Woodcutting]] required). Use a [[shrinking potion]] on the beanstalk first; then, take an [[axe]] and chop away. Go back to Sylas for your reward.\n\n[[File:Grim Tales - Felling beanstalk.gif|frame|centre|Chopping the beanstalk down.]]\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Grim Tales\n|image = [[File:Grim Tales reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Woodcutting|60,000}} [[Woodcutting]] experience\n*{{SCP|Agility|25,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*{{SCP|Thieving|25,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{SCP|Herblore|15,000}} [[Herblore]] experience\n*{{SCP|Farming|10,000}} [[Farming]] experience\n*{{SCP|Hitpoints|5,000}} [[Hitpoints]] experience\n*[[Dwarven helmet]] (equip this helmet in the [[Dwarven Mines]] to complete a [[Hard Falador Diary|Hard Falador task]])\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Glod]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Grim Tales is required for the following:\n*Hard tier of the [[Falador Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Music==\n*[[Fe Fi Fo Fum]]\n*[[Mouse Trap]]\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 30 November 2022\n|update = The Garden of Death & More\n|poll = Future Quests & Combat Achievement Rewards\n|change = The following skill experience rewards have increased:\n*[[Woodcutting]] from 14,000 to 60,000\n*[[Agility]] from 6,000 to 25,000.\n*[[Thieving]] from 6,000 to 25,000.\n*[[Herblore]] from 5,000 to 15,000.\n*[[Farming]] from 4,000 to 10,000.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Parts of the quest, including the name, are references to the well-known fairy tale collection ''{{wp|Grimms' Fairy Tales}}'':\n**\"{{wp|The Griffin (fairy tale)|The Griffin}}\" (getting a feather from a griffin by telling it stories)\n**\"{{wp|Rapunzel}}\" (climbing Rupert's beard)\n*Climbing the magic beanstalk for a golden reward is a reference to \"{{wp|Jack and the Beanstalk}}\".\n*The [[shrinking potion]] is a reference to ''{{wp|Alice in Wonderland}}''.\n*On the first day of release, when you clicked to see the rewards you got the message ''\"Spoilers are only given on the day of release in fairy tales\"''.\n*After the player names the gnome in the story with Grimgnash, Grimgnash gets upset. He claims \"You shouldn't name food! If Human had a carrot, would Human call it Jasper?\" This is a reference to the British comedian {{wp|Jasper Carrott}}.\n*The silent 'q' in the princess's name is a reference to the \"Bookshop\" sketch in ''{{wp|Monty Python}}''.\n*[[Glod]], the quest's final boss, resembles {{wp|Hulk (comics)|The Hulk}} in many ways. Both are bare-chested, have discoloured skin, have a similar face and hairstyle, and yell \"SMASH!\".\n*Glod may possibly be named after characters in Norse mythology: Glut, who was a particularly evil giant, and Hod, the god who guarded the Bifrost Bridge, who is similar in build to Glod.\n*Glod is an anagram of \"gold\", this may be another reference to climbing a magic beanstalk for gold.\n*Removing the 'd' from [[Rupert the Beard]] will leave you with {{wp|Rupert Bear|Rupert the Bear}}, a children's comic strip character.\n*This quest has the fourth highest skill level requirement of any quest, with [[Woodcutting]] at level 71; beaten by [[Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire]]  with a requirement of 75 [[Firemaking]] and [[Magic]], [[Dragon Slayer II]] with a requirement of 75 [[Magic]], and [[Making Friends with My Arm]] with a requirement of 72 Mining.\n*If a player kills a mouse in the mouse hole, the drops will be larger than normal. When picked up, the items will appear as \"normal\" in the player's inventory.\n* When the player asks about Sylas' rare items, he mentions his most prized possession is a [[hornless unicorn]]. This references the running joke that horses do not exist in ''RuneScape'' and the popular requests for mountable horses from the pre-''Old School'' community.\n* When Rupert the Beard leaves the tower he yells \"FREEDOM!\" This is a reference William Wallace's battle cry in the film ''{{wp|Braveheart}}''.\n\n{{Grim Tales}}"

He works in the sandpit but has found a severed hand and is afraid to tell the authorities for fear of losing his job. Agree to lend him a hand and you will receive a [[sandy hand]]. He'll tell you to go talk to the [[Guard Captain|captain of the guards]]. He hangs around [[Dragon Inn|the inn]] in Yanille, usually drunk.\n\nTake the hand to the captain of the guards in the [[Ye Olde Dragon Inn]]; he'll demand a beer. Give him a pint; a cheap [[beer]] can be bought from the [[bartender]] for two [[coins]]. He will ramble on, and then, he'll take a look at the hand and accidentally drop it in his beer, turning it into a [[beer soaked hand]]. He suggests it was probably the wizards who did it and suggest you ring the bell of their guild and talk to 'the first pointy hatted ninny you shee.'\n\nGo to the [[Wizards' Guild]], east of the bar; enter if you meet the requirements (66 [[Magic]]), or ring the bell to make [[Zavistic Rarve]] come out. Talk to him to wave the hand in front of his face and enquire whether the guild still has all of its wizards. You explain the situation and hand him the hand. He will tell you that this is the hand of one of his wizard students, [[Clarence]]. He'll ask you to see if Bert's working schedule has changed recently, for he has been working rather long hours recently.\n\n===Sandy the slavedriver===\n{{Map|2790,3176|rectX=8|rectY=7|mtype=rectangle|align=right|caption=Sandy's whereabouts.}}\nReturn to [[Bert]]'s home and talk to him again. He'll tell you that he works for [[Sandy's Sand Corp]], which is based in [[Brimhaven]], by hauling sand from there to the pit in Yanille. He'll give you a copy of his [[Bert's rota|schedule]] and tell you that it hasn't changed recently, or so he thinks. Now, you need to head to [[Sandy]] in Brimhaven to compare Bert's rota with the original. You can go to [[Ardougne]] and pay 30 [[coins]] to get to Brimhaven. Sandy is located in the office just north-west of the [[Dead Man's Chest]] bar.\n\n[[File:Sandy chathead.png|left]]\nIn Brimhaven, you'll see Sandy in his office. You can talk to him first if you want, but this isn't necessary. Search his desk in the house to get Bert's old schedule. Read it and compare it to the other schedule to see that Bert has indeed been working longer hours. While you're here, [[pickpocket]] Sandy to find some [[sand]] in his pocket — this may take multiple attempts. Keep it; it will become important later on in the quest.\n\n===Truth serum===\n{{Needed|[[Bert's rota]], [[Sandy's rota]], [[white berries]], [[redberries]], [[lantern lens]], [[sand]] (pickpocketed from [[Sandy]]), empty [[vial]].|recommended=A second empty [[vial]]}}\n\nNow, you need to visit [[Bert]] once more. Talk to Bert in [[Yanille]] to inform him of his changed hours. He will not remember it and blame it on the wizards and the magic leaking from their nearby guild. You give him the rotas in exchange for [[a magic scroll]] that appeared in his house recently. He instructs you to see whether 'those infernal wizards' are up to anything.\n\nTake the scroll to [[Zavistic Rarve]] at the [[Wizards' Guild]] to learn that it's a mind-altering scroll, explaining why Bert doesn't remember his hours' changing. You suspect [[Sandy]] is behind it and Zavistic asks you to first get [[Betty]] in [[Port Sarim]] to make you a [[truth serum]] and then record Sandy using the [[magical orb]] he gives you. If you ask him to help you more, he will teleport you to Betty's shop just once in exchange for an empty [[vial]].\n\n[[File:Betty chathead.png|left]]\n[[Betty]] can be found in a small shop marked by the [[File:Magic shop icon.png|frameless]] icon on the [[minimap]]. Talk to Betty about the quest and she will ask for another empty vial. In return, she gives you some [[bottled water]]. You need to add redberries to make [[redberry juice]], then add white berries to make [[pink dye]]. Once you've made some, use it on a bullseye lantern lens to create a [[rose-tinted lens]].\n\nTalk to Betty again. She tells you to stand in the doorway while the door is open and shine your lens at the counter to focus the light on an empty vial whilst she pours the [[truth serum]] into it. Do so by clicking on the lens in your inventory, then using it on the counter. This will heat up and shatter the lens. Speak to Betty again; you now need a personal item from Sandy for the potion to work.\n\nReturn to Sandy's office and pickpocket him to get some loose [[sand]] if you had not already. Return to Betty for her to finish the serum with the handful of sand. She warns you that you should dilute the serum in tea or coffee or else 'bits' might drop off the drinker.\n\nMake sure to buy five [[earth rune]]s from Betty before you leave if you don't have them already.\n\n===Sandy Truth-Be-Told===\n{{Needed|[[Truth serum]], [[magical orb]]}}\n[[File:The Hand in the Sand - Sandy confesses.png|thumb|220px|Sandy confesses to killing Clarence, thanks to the truth serum.]]\nBack in [[Brimhaven]], return to [[Sandy]]. He has a mug of steaming coffee next to him, but will require distraction for you to be able to add the truth serum. Get him distracted with tall tales of herds of giant mutant herrings and pygmy shrews. Try all the options, as there is no guaranteed one that will work. Once he looks out the window, use the [[Truth serum|serum]] on his coffee. He will drink it. Next, activate your [[magical orb]] and talk to him.\n\nHe'll confess that he bribed a wizard to put a mind-altering spell on [[Bert]]. He then changed Bert's schedule so that he'd work longer for the same salary. Afterwards, Sandy killed the wizard so that he wouldn't have to pay him; then, he buried parts of him in all of the sandboxes around Gielinor. This fills the magical orb; return to Zavistic in Yanille to show him the evidence.\n\n===And Sandy said, \"Drat- foiled again!\"===\n{{Needed|5 [[earth rune]]s, a [[bucket of sand]].}}\n[[File:Magically refilled sandpit.gif|thumb|220x220px|The sand magically refills, thanks to Zavistic Rarve.]]\nHand Zavistic Rarve the [[magical orb]] in your inventory - it is proof of [[Sandy]]'s confession. He asks for five [[earth rune]]s and a [[bucket of sand]], refusing to tell you why. Bring these to him. A bucket can be filled at Bert's [[sandpit]] if necessary. He will then cast a spell on [[Bert]]'s sandpit to magically refill itself to compensate Bert for his troubles. He will no longer have to work! Zavistic says he has sent wizards around the various sandpits of RuneScape to find the remains of Clarence and asks you to check on the [[Entrana]]n one.\n\nGo to Entrana (there is a bank deposit box at Port Sarim to deposit all armour and weapons before going to the holy island). Talk to [[Mazion]] by the sandpit to get the dead [[wizard's head]]. Give this to Zavistic Rarve. He'll confirm that it belongs to [[Clarence]] and that the wizard will be buried the same day. He has also sent word for Sandy to be arrested and gives you a reward for your help.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n'''Tip:''' Speak to Bert right after completing the quest to complete a medium [[Ardougne Diary]] task.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Hand in the Sand\n|image = [[File:The Hand in the Sand reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Thieving|1,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{SCP|Crafting|9,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*Ability to buy [[pink dye]] from [[Betty]]\n*A secret reward from [[Bert]] - He simply loves sand, and wasn't in the job for the money. He will ship 84 [[buckets of sand]] to your bank if you talk to him after the quest. This can be done once per day (UTC). Asking Bert to take sand to your bank is also an [[Ardougne Medium]] task.\n*Access to the [[Wizards' Guild]] [[Magic Guild Store (Runes and Staves)|rune store]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of The Hand in the Sand is required for the following:\n* [[While Guthix Sleeps]]\n* [[Ardougne Medium Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 17 February 2021\n|update = 8th Birthday Event and LMS Changes\n|change = You can now reclaim your [[Magical Orb]] from [[Zavistic Rarve]] if you lose it during The Hand in the Sand quest.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*After handing [[Zavistic Rarve]] the wizard's head he will say \"Alas poor Clarence.

To reach the abandoned mine players will either have to have started [[Nature spirit]] or have access to [[Barrows teleport]] or [[Mort'ton teleport]] scroll.\n\nPlayers starting from [[Canifis]] will have to head west and enter the swamps through the gate. Travel south along the [[River Salve]]. Begin along the long winding path to [[Mort'ton]]. At the most south-west part of the path is the starting point of this quest. Look for a grey field on the minimap.\n\nPlayers teleporting to Barrows using [[Barrows Teleport]] tablet need to head west and follow the Mort'ton the instructions from the following paragraph.\n\nPlayers teleporting to [[Mort'ton]] with a [[Mort'ton teleport]] scroll or a [[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton minigame]] [[minigame teleport|teleport]], have to head west and follow the winding paths to the mine. Alternatively, if [[In Aid of the Myreque]] has been completed up to a certain point, they can head south and use the shortcut in [[Burgh de Rott]]'s western fence, but beware of [[feral vampyre]]s.\n\nPlayers who have access to [[fairy rings]] may find the following codes helpful:\n\n*{{Fairycode|cks}} - West of [[Canifis]], at the entrance gate of the swamp.\n*{{Fairycode|bkr}} - South of Canifis, a short way into the swamp.\n*{{Fairycode|bip}} - On an island west of the [[Nature Grotto]], which lies in the southern part of the swamp. You'll need level 50 [[Agility]] to cross a stepping stone to get to [[Morytania]].\n\nFor the boss fight, high level food is strongly recommended, as you will take a lot of damage at all levels. If you have no previous experience (or limited memory) of the fight, read the \"[[Haunted Mine#Treus's wrath|boss fight]]\" section below in the quest guide. It is important to be well-prepared for the fight! Bring all the items required to finish the quest, including supplies for the boss fight (don't forget to bring a [[druid pouch]] if travelling through the swamps and not having lit the [[Fire pit|Fire of Dehumidification]]).\n\n===The mysteries of Mort Ridge===\n[[File:Zealot chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:Haunted Mine - Zealot.png|thumb|The [[zealot]] tells you about the mine and its contents.]]\nIn the area between the mine and the swamps, a Saradominist [[zealot]] is walking around. He demands to know your allegiance. Tell him either you are on the path of [[Saradomin]] or [[Guthix]] or have no particular allegiance, then ask about what he is doing in the name of the god of wisdom. (He will be less than friendly if you state you are [[Zamorak]]ian and send you away.) He divulges he is on a quest to strengthen Saradomin's name in Morytania, explaining that you are standing atop the now abandoned Mort Ridge Mines that used to be exploited by the Morytanians until the [[Misthalin - Morytania War]] and the blessing of the [[River Salve]]. The mine is also said to contain the legendary [[Salve amulet]], carved from the crystals that grow within due to the blessed river water seeping through the rock. This Salve amulet is said to afford its bearer power over [[undead|evil]], wherefore the zealot seeks to gain access to the mines and craft another.\n\nHe moreover adds that the mine is haunted; it was once protected by a Zamorakian mage named [[Treus Dayth]], who was slain by Saradominists that managed to make off with a shard of crystal. The livid chaos god is said to then have cursed Dayth's soul and bound it to the crystals to prevent their being reached again. Moreover, following this incident, [[Lowerniel Drakan|the ruler of the land]] ordered the mines to be sealed and everyone within to be slaughtered due to the crystals' effects. Rather than risk losing their workforce to the Saradominists, the Morytanians brutally killed them. The victims' souls are now rumoured to haunt the mine.\n\nAsk about other entrances into the mine. The zealot confirms a second entrance may exist and has come into possession of a key granting access to the lower levels of the mine. He is still trying to work out where the second entrance may be, but remarks it was not made for humans. Ask him whether you may borrow the key; he refuses, saying the mission can only be entrusted to himself. No matter how much you attempt to persuade him, he will not part with the key.\n\n[[Pickpocket]] him to get [[Zealot's key|his key]], which is needed later in the quest. Do not forget to get this, or you will have to come back for it later.\n\nWalk south of the unfortunate cleric to the cart track; do not descend the stone stairs for you will be met by locked doors. Beware of the [[feral vampyre]]s on the prowl. Climb over the second-to-last cart, then walk past the last cart and crawl through the cart tunnel. If you don't have 15 Agility to climb over the cart, go to the west side of the mountain instead and enter the northern entrance.\n\n===Into the depths===\n{{main|Abandoned Mine}}\n\nYou find yourself in a dark cave with many bats big and small and many pickaxes and corpses strewn about. Some skeletons are dormant; the ones called [[corpse]]s in yellow letters spring alive as [[skeletal miner]]s when you approach. Similarly, some pickaxes may become [[Possessed pickaxe|possessed]] and attack you when you pick them up. Throughout the mine, you will also encounter many creepy [[haze]]s. They are spooky but harmless, although they can sometimes turn into aggressive [[ghost]]s when adjacent. Your task is to make your way to the depths of the caves and find the Salve crystal. Make sure to avoid any [[Mine cart (Abandoned Mine)|mine cart]]s moving on their own accord; they will damage you if you get in their way.\n\nIn the cave, follow the cart track west. Ignore the two ladders going down, continue west and crawl-through the cart tunnel to end up outside next to the [[River Salve]]. Walk south following the tracks to a second cave entrance. Once inside, go east. You will find a ladder at the end of the blocked path. Go down the ladder to the next level in the cave.\n\nHead directly east and go down another ladder.\n\nFollow the path to the cart track running north to south. Do not get hit by the mine cart that is moving along on the track. Wait for the cart to head south. Follow the cart south and wait in the alcove on the west side of the track. When the cart passes north, run south to the ladder. Climb down another level, the fourth.\n\n[[File:Abandoned Mine - Level 4 map.png|thumb|220px|A map of the fourth level.]]\nThe fourth level of the cave has several landmarks which are marked on the map to the right. The corresponding letters show the locations of each landmark.\n\n*'''(X)''' The [[Glowing fungus|glowing fungi]]\n*'''(P)''' The point-set panel (map of mine tracks)\n*'''(T)''' The cart\n*'''(Q)''' The levers A, B, C, D, and E\n*'''(R)''' The levers F, G, H, I, J, and K\n*'''(U)''' The water valve\n*'''(A)''' A [[chisel]] spawn\n*'''(13)''' The water-powered lift\n[[File:Glowing fungi.png|thumb|A cluster of fungi in a stagnant pool.]]\nShould you head down farther by going down ladders instead of taking the route taking you outside and make use of the lift, you will end up in a flooded, dark cave. The water extinguishes any [[light sources]] you might have and [[Damp tinderbox|ruins tinderboxes]]. You will therefore need something to be able to see further into the cave. Fortunately, the cave described above is abundant with [[Glowing fungus|luminescent fungi]] that could well do this for you. Unfortunately, the mushrooms disintegrate when taken outside the cave, not able to withstand being exposed even the dimmed daylight of Morytania. As such, you shall have to transport a fungus to the flooded level without actually carrying it.\n\n===Getting a light===\nYou are currently at Ladder '''(12)''' in the south part of the map. Head west and pick a [[glowing fungus]] '''(X)''' growing in the pools around you.\n\nThe glowing fungus is the light source required to access the deepest level of the mines. As daylight exposure will cause them to crumble to [[ashes]], do '''not''' take glowing fungi outside of the cave. '''Random events that teleport players to another area''' (e.g. [[Quiz Master]]) '''will also cause the fungi to turn to ash.''' Be sure to dismiss them as soon as they appear. Instead, the complex system of mine carts will be used to transport the fungi light source to the correct part of the cave.\n\n:'''Note:''' If you die during the boss fight, you will need to get another glowing fungus and send it through the mine cart again, but you will not need to set the levers again as they will remain the same.\n\nAfter picking a [[glowing fungus]] '''(X)''', continue north-west. On the west side of a pool, alongside four crates, is a searchable cart. Place the fungus in the cart '''(T)'''.\n\n'''Warning!''' Do not at any point drop the glowing fungus as it will crumble to dust and you will have to retrieve another one.\n\n====All aboard!====\nFrom the mine cart, head north and then west to the track map '''(P)''', which operates the cart system. Click the [[points settings]] panel on the northern wall of the corridor. It shows a map of all the cart tracks on this level as well as ten junctions that can each be in two positions. Pressing the red start button sets the cart system in motion. The objective is to get the cart from the start position on the left to the exit point at the ladder in the top right corner (north-west). If you fail, you can simply retry but you will need to replace the fungus.\n\nThe map also shows two groups of levers controlling the junctions. Examining them reveals to which they correspond. The levers A through E are south-east of the control panel (location '''(Q)''' on the map above), whereas F through J are north, around the corner (location '''(R)'''). Beware of skeletal miners lying in ambush at both stations. In order to get the cart towards the correct exit, study the route map carefully. The levers F, G and H '''cannot''' be pulled, as they are inaccessible. These junctions are therefore fixed, limiting your options. The cart will follow the ''crimson (lighter red)'' route at any junction when approaching from the tail direction of the corresponding arrow. Pulling the respective lever exchanges the crimson and burgundy arrows at the junction. When approaching a junction from the arrow head's direction, its orientation (i.e., colour) does not matter ''as long as it is a straight path''. In order to round a corner and not plunge into a wall or the water, the direction taken by the cart must be marked by a crimson arrow.\n\n<gallery widths=\"300\">\nHaunted Mine - Levers A-E.png|Levers A-E.\nHaunted Mine - Levers I-K.png|Levers F-K. (The blocked levers F, G & H are unmarked in this picture.)\nHaunted Mine - Track map.png|The mine cart route solution.\n</gallery>\n\nOperate all the levers in accordance with the rules above and then check the control panel to make sure that the route on your map directs the mine cart to the ladder. Operate the mine cart by pressing the start button and the map will show the path of the mine cart.\n\nDepending on the contents and route of the cart, four outcomes are possible. They are indicated both by the second half of the short cutscene, and a game message or player dialogue:\n* {{mes|Oh dear, the mine cart seems to have sunk.}} - The cart sinks into the water. Any fungus in the cart will be destroyed.\n* {{mes|How useful, it's come right back to where it started.}} - The cart returns to the start. Any fungus in the cart will still be in the cart.\n* '''Player:''' I wonder if that cart is anywhere useful now? - The cart successfully makes it to the other side. The fungus will now be on the other side.\n* ''(No message)'' - The cart successfully makes it to the other side. There was no fungus in the cart before sending it.\n\nIf the cart sinks, the [[glowing fungus]] is removed from the cart. In that case, pick another glowing fungus and put it in the cart '''(T)'''. Operate the appropriate levers to fix the problem and hit the red button again.\n\nWhen the mine cart reaches the correct end point, you will remark that it may have ended up somewhere useful. If your character doesn't make a comment about the location of the cart, put another mushroom in and send the cart off again.\n\n====Retrieving the fungus====\nYou will now have to reach the ladder yourself to retrieve the fungus. First, retrace your steps to the very top of the mine. Go back up the ladder '''(12)''' near the [[Glowing fungus|glowing fungi]] pool. Walk north along the track, avoiding the cart. Take the first path to the east and climb up the ladder at the end of the path. Go west and up the ladder, then exit the cave to the [[River Salve]].\n\nYou are now outside again and any fungi you have on you will crumble to ash. Go north and enter the northern cave. Climb down the first ladder immediately to the east and head north-east through the cave. Climb down the ladder to the next level. Head west to the '''north-west corner''' of the cave and climb down the ladder.\n\nSearch the nearby cart and take the glowing fungus that was put in earlier. Don't lose or drop the fungus until you have completed the quest! If you drop the fungus, it will disintegrate and you have to reobtain one. If there is no fungus in the cart, repeat the previous process starting by placing a new glowing fungus in the cart '''(T)'''.\n\nClimb back up with the fungus in your possession. Do '''not''' take the mine cart track leading south. The only ladder you will be able to access, in the south-west, does not lead anywhere useful (namely, across the  pool with fungi).\n\n===Waterlogged===\n'''''Items required:''' Zealot's key, good [[armour]] and a good [[weapon]], plenty of high-healing [[food]]. In addition to this, a [[super energy]] potion, or even better yet, a [[stamina potion]], is highly recommended since killing the [[Treus Dayth|ghost]] requires a lot of running! An emergency teleport may be useful too.''\n\nInstead, head all the way east past the ladder going up and then south past a moving cart. Climb down the ladder to end up in a side cave east of the flooded tracks.\n\nHead south down the corridor. Pick up the [[chisel]] (Ironman and lower level players; You can very easily return to grab the chisel after the boss fight to save an inventory slot. You will not need to do the valve run again.) from the spawn on top of a crate if you did not bring one. There is a water-powered lift going further down but it isn't working. There is a water valve next to it, at the other side of a large pipe, which requires turning in order to power the lift. Locate the water valve and attempt to turn it; it's locked but there is a small keyhole in its side.\n[[File:Abandoned Mine flooded chamber.png|thumb|Taking a swim from the lift.]]\nUse the [[zealot's key]] on the valve to activate the water flow from the nearby basin. Make sure you have sufficient [[run energy]] before heading back to the lift, for a [[mischievous ghost]] will appear and try to shut off the valve before you can reach the lift. Run quickly around the water pipe system to the lift and go down. If the ghosts beats you, simply turn the valve again and retry. The lift remains operational after the initial activation, so the zealot's key is no longer needed. He can be pickpocketed again to obtain another key though.\n\nThe lift will drop you into a pool of water. To go back up, simply click on the lift and you will automatically swim towards it. From the flooded chamber, walk south onto the track (beware of possessed pickaxes) and '''follow it to the east'''. (The western corridor leads to a locked door that you cannot open yet.) Proceed down the staircase. With the [[glowing fungus]], the cave will be properly lit. Go west through the door into a large chamber with [[loading crane]]s and [[Mine cart (Abandoned Mine)|mine cart]]s. This room is where the boss fight will take place. '''Do not take the [[Crystal-mine key|innocent-looking key]] until you are completely ready to begin!'''\n\n===Treus's wrath===\n:'''Note:''' ''Read this part fully before entering the fight if you're not experienced with the fight! Especially if you're low [[combat]]! This boss fight is difficult and should not be taken lightly. High-healing food is recommended. The surrounding environment is more dangerous than the actual [[Treus Dayth|boss]] itself.''\n[[File:Haunted Mine - Crystal-mine key.png|thumb|220px|The crystal mine key appears suspiciously easy to take.]]\n[[File:Treus Dayth chathead.png|left]]\nTo start the fight, try to pick up the [[Crystal-mine key|innocent-looking key]]. It will float away and return. Click the chatbox to continue the dialogue and the ghost of [[Treus Dayth]] (combat level 95), the erstwhile guardian of the Salve crystals, will appear and start to attack you! He will be identified on the minimap as a flashing yellow arrow. He will use his ghostly powers to move through obstacles about the room and mainly attack you with his ranged attack and possessed machinery, When chasing Treus Dayth, try to stay out of the way of the moving carts and the cranes.\n\nThe ghost itself is not that strong, but the damage from the environment can be serious. Treus will continually become invisible and move to another part of the chamber after some hits are dealt — and the more the fight progresses, the sooner he will move, sometimes even after one hit, which is where weapons with a high maximum hit comes in handy — which makes killing this boss very difficult/time consuming without [[Energy potion|energy]]/[[super energy]]/[[stamina potion]]s. Whilst invisible, he cannot be attacked, but a yellow arrow indicates where he is. A large supply of food and optionally potions is advised depending on your combat level. An emergency teleport (a ring of life or the [[Ectophial]]) is very useful too.\n\nDuring the fight, carts and cranes around the room will start to operate and can cause major harm, so players should avoid them when possible. The cranes are stationary and can hit for fairly high typeless damage, but they are inaccurate and easily avoided by staying out of their reach. The carts can only move along the track they are on, similar to the other carts in the dungeon. However, these carts are dangerous because they can hit rapidly, dealing up to 9 damage every tick while dragging a player along the track. Additionally, [[pickaxe]]s will be '''constantly''' thrown at the player during the fight, hitting as much as 15 damage in one attack. [[Protect from Missiles]] is recommended for this fight, although it '''only provides 33% protection''' against the pickaxes, reducing their max hit to 10 damage. Magic attacks are very effective against the boss. Killing Treus Dayth counts towards ghost Slayer tasks. A kill will grant 100 slayer experience.\n\n====Strategy====\nA highly viable strategy for low to mid-level players who can equip [[Iban's staff]] (requiring 50 [[Attack]], [[Magic]], and completion of [[Underground Pass]]) is to use [[Iban Blast]], as it hits accurately (especially against this boss) and very high. If using [[Melee]], bring the highest-hitting [[melee weapon]] you can use, such as a [[2h sword]] or [[halberd]], as this boss has a high chance to teleport somewhere else after being hit.\n\n'''Tip''': If things get heavy and too difficult, you can walk out by the door on the east and easily manage health and [[prayer]] there. The boss will not reset and still have the same amount of health as when you left the door.\n\nIt is '''not''' possible to freeze the ghost from moving using Magic or the Zamorak Godsword special attack. [[Crumble Undead]] works well against him, '''but be advised''' that a [[Skull sceptre (i)]] ('''Must be imbued''' otherwise no requirements to wield), [[Slayer's staff|Slayer Staff]] (requiring 55 Slayer + 50 Magic) or a [[Void knight mace|Void Knight Mace]] (costing 250 [[Pest Control]] points & requiring 42 Melee, Ranged, Magic, and 22 Prayer) are three of the lowest requirement weapons with which you can autocast Crumble. A [[trident of the seas]] and [[trident of the swamp]] are also good options.\n\n[[File:Haunted Mine - Fighting Treus Dayth.png|thumb|Fighting [[Treus Dayth]].]]\nAn example strategy that works quite well: bring a 4-dose [[Prayer potion]], optionally a [[Ranging potion]], and the best [[Ranged weapon]]ry you can muster, along with an inventory filled with food. Use Protect from Missiles at all times. When you reach Treus Dayth, switch on [[Eagle Eye]] to make your shots count, shoot, and then switch it off when he moves away (keep Protect from Missiles on). He likes moving between the north-western and north-eastern side of the room, in which case you are recommended to run along the northern-most cart track in the detached tunnel, where you only have to dodge one cart. If he moves south, try to hug the cavern walls to avoid the cranes as you approach him. However, don't hesitate while fighting — it's better to take a bit of extra damage and be faster than be indecisive and suffer as a result. Before fighting, you are also recommended to explore the room and practice how you are going to move around without taking too much damage — the machinery doesn't activate before the fight.\n\nUsing a [[dragon dagger]] is also a good alternative. Its [[special attack]] hits twice in one go, but this boss will only receive one of those hits before he moves away to a new spot and before you even get to him the second attack from the dagger will automatically hit him. You can keep using this tactic on the boss with minimum movement as you can use the dragon dagger's special attack numerous times during the fight.\n\nA good mid-tier magic attack that works effectively is [[Iban Blast]], or even [[Fire Bolt]] wearing [[chaos gauntlets]] on the cheap. The only downside to magic is that [[magic armour]] provides very little Ranged Defence; however, since the boss has negative magic defence, you can have a negative magic attack bonus of -35 or higher and still hit consistently. This allows for a set such as [[rune platebody]]/[[rune platelegs|platelegs]]/[[rune kiteshield|kiteshield]], [[farseer helm]], [[amulet of glory]], [[barrows gloves|Recipe for Disaster gloves]]/chaos gauntlets, and [[boots of lightness]] with Iban's staff/[[elemental staff]] to be an effective set both for damage and defence against the boss. Combined with decent food/prayer potions, you should be able to kill this boss fairly easy by just [[praying range]] and running back and forth along the northern tunnel if possible.\n\nIf you die, your items will appear inside a grave for 15 minutes. You must get another glowing fungus to get to the grave however. If you fail to retrieve your grave in time your items will be at [[Death's Office]].\n\n===Salvation at last===\n[[File:Haunted Mine - Crystal mine.png|thumb|220px|The long sought-after Salve crystals.]]\nAfter defeating [[Treus Dayth]], the machinery will stop attacking you. Pick up the innocent-looking key, which no longer resists and is, in fact, the [[crystal-mine key]]. Now, head back east through the door and climb up the stairs. Walk all the way west until you reach another staircase and head down.\n\nThe crystal-mine key opens the large door to a room with several [[crystal outcrop]]s in the south-east corner. Use a [[chisel]] to cut a piece from the crystal outcrop (35 Crafting required; boostable). If you forgot your chisel, go back up the lift and pick up the chisel from on top of the crate. You will obtain a [[salve shard]] that can be crafted into a new amulet. Be sure to cut extras for backup!\n\nA nearby cart tunnel leads right back to the entrance of the mine and can henceforth be used as shortcut.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Haunted Mine\n|image = [[File:Haunted Mine reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Strength|22,000}} [[Strength]] [[experience]]\n*The ability to make the [[Salve amulet]], which when equipped gives combat bonuses against undead monsters.\n*Access to a [[Abandoned Mine#Shortcut after the quest|shortcut]] to the [[crystal outcrop]]s\n*Access to [[Tarn's Lair]]\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Treus Dayth]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Haunted Mine is required for the following:\n*[[Lair of Tarn Razorlor]]\n*Medium tier of the [[Morytania Diary]]\n*Hard tier of the [[Morytania Diary]]\n*Elite tier of the [[Ardougne Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{{MusicUnlockTableHead}}\n{{MusicUnlockLine|Spooky 2|details=Unlocked on the first level of the mine.}}\n{{MusicUnlockLine|Deep Down|details=Unlocked on the second level of the mine.}}\n{{MusicUnlockLine|Chamber|details=Unlocked on the fourth level of the mine.}}\n{{MusicUnlockLine|Haunted Mine|link=Haunted Mine (music track)|details=Unlocked on the sixth level of the mine.}}\n{{MusicUnlockTableBottom}}\n\n==Additional tips==\n*Players can use a [[ball of wool]] on a salve shard to make a [[Salve amulet]].\n*The [[crystal-mine key]] can be added to the [[steel key ring]].\n*Mining [[mithril ore]] within the [[Abandoned Mine]] is a hard task in the [[Morytania Diary]] set.

The closest mithril ore vein is also in the south-east corner where you end the quest.

It was the second quest to feature a [[Mahjarrat]], and introduces [[Hazeel]], a [[Zamorak]]ian Mahjarrat that has been put into a state of torpor, and his followers are attempting to revive him in time for the next Ritual of Rejuvenation.\n\nThis quest is notable in that it has two sides, a \"good\" side and an \"evil\" side, sharing this trait with [[Temple of Ikov]], another Mahjarrat quest. In the \"good\" side, the player foils the cultists in their attempt to resurrect Hazeel, and in the \"evil\" side, the player joins the cult and assists them in resurrecting Hazeel.\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Central [[Ardougne]], south of [[King Lathas]]' [[Ardougne Castle|castle]].

You can either choose to help [[Ceril Carnillean]] get his family armour back and foil the plan to revive [[Hazeel]], or you can choose to help Hazeel's followers murder a Carnillean and resurrect their master. Siding with Ceril can be considered the \"good\" choice, while resurrecting Hazeel can be viewed as the \"evil\" choice.\n\n'''Note:''' Both sides of this quest will give the ''exact same reward'', with one exception: siding with Ceril will reward 5 additional [[coins]] and gives you the option to obtain Carnillean armour (detailed below), and siding with Hazeel will reward the [[Hazeel's mark]], which is a purely cosmetic reward. Ceril's side is quicker, but requires killing [[Alomone]], which is not recommended for very low-level players. Rewards may only be obtained during or upon completion of the quest, and can '''never''' be reclaimed afterward. Your choice will also have a minor effect on the events of the quest [[Secrets of the North]], so choose wisely!\n\n==Walkthrough for the Ceril side==\n[[File:Hazeel Cult - Quest map.png|thumb|409x409px|Map Showing the Hazeel Cult Quest Legend:<br/>\n1: Start quest, [[Ceril Carnillean]],\n2: [[Clivet]],\n3: [[Alomone]] (level 13),\nA: Quest Area (Area to travel, from begin to end).\nGreen numbers indicate valve locations.]]\n'''Items needed:''' Weapon, armour and food.\n\nTo begin, head to the south-western corner of East Ardougne.

Talk to [[Clivet]] to learn about [[Hazeel]], an ancient and powerful follower of Zamorak who was killed by an ancestor of Ceril. He will ask for your help in reviving Hazeel. '''Refuse'''.\n\nClivet will sail away on a raft, saying that you'll never be able to find him.

He will tell you that the Carnilleans' butler should have killed you by now. He will then attack you. Kill him, then open the chest in the room to get the [[Carnillean armour]]. If you'd like an extra one for yourself, drop the armour, open the chest a second time, then pick up the dropped armour.\n\n'''Note:''' Alomone can't be killed with a [[Dwarf multicannon]].\n\nRe-board the raft in order to return to the sewer entrance. Back at the Carnilleans' house, talk to [[Butler Jones]], followed by [[Ceril Carnillean]] on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} of the house. He'll take the armour from you and give you 5 coins, but won't believe you about Butler Jones.\n\n'''Note:''' This quest reward is not the ''real'' quest reward, and is shown to players as a joke.

'''Accept.'''\n\nThe first thing you need to do is kill a member of the Carnillean family. Go to the basement of Ceril's house, and use the bottle of poison that he gives you on the range. Then, go upstairs and talk to Ceril Carnillean to learn that Scruffy, the dog, is dead.\n\nTalk to Clivet again to begin the next part of the ritual. He'll give you [[Hazeel's mark]], then tell you to find the cult hideout. You need to find five [[Sewer valve]]s and turn them the proper direction.

Speak to [[Prince Itzla]], who will propose you and him go undercover by infiltrating the [[Twilight Emissaries]]. As he discusses the plan, his mother, [[Queen Zyanyi Arkan]], will arrive. Frustrated at her son's failure to protect his father, Itzla tells her about his plans to lead the infiltration. However, she refuses, insisting that he confide in someone he absolutely trusts to lead in his stead. After the Queen's departure, Itzla relents and asks you to visit a pub in the [[Quetzacalli Gorge]] to meet a trusted contact of his, who will fill you in on the infiltration operation.\n\nHead south-west towards [[Renu]] and fly to the Quetzacalli Gorge, then head to [[the Windbreaker]] pub and speak to the bartender. Ask him to rent the basement room as instructed, only to find out a basement doesn't exist; he will offer to let you rent the ground floor room for 30 coins instead. If you don't have 30 coins, either pickpocket the citizens around the area or use the bank just east of the pub. Once you have the coins, accept the bartender's offer, then head to the east room and rest at the [[Bed (The Heart of Darkness)|bed]].\n\nUpon waking up, you will find a disguised Prince Itzla to be your \"trusted contact\". He claims that there are very few people he can trust after the events of the previous quest, and that the less people who know about his mission, the better; additionally, as an outsider fairly uninvolved in Varlamorian politics, you ironically are far more trustworthy. He will then tell you that he believes a shopkeeper in the Gorge is recruiting members for the cult, and that you will pose as a potential recruit in the hopes he'll contact the Emissaries.\n\nHead out east to the [[Quetzacalli Gorge General Store]] and speak to the shopkeeper, and tell him that you've heard he can offer help to those in need. He is initially skeptical, but accepts your request to join the Emissaries, and tells you and your \"friend\" to head to the Twilight Temple, where he'll send word for them to expect two recruits. Return to Prince Itzla at [[the Windbreaker]], he will then meet you at the Temple.\n\n===Trials of the Emissaries===\n{{Needed|4 empty inventory slots|recommended=10 [[Quetzal feed]], 3 [[limestone brick]]s, and 4 [[soft clay]].

Head north-east past the gate, and make your way east past [[the Proudspire]], then head south to the [[Tower of Ascension]] to meet Prince Itzla. He will tell you that a person named [[Forebearer Janus]] will call on the both of you when its time to be tested. In the meantime, he wishes to speak to the nearby recruits for insights on why they wish to join the Emissaries.\n\nTalk to the nearby recruits: [[Nova]], [[Sergius]], [[Felius]], and [[Caritta]]. Nova will speak of the Augur, the new leader of the Emissaries, who has reorganized the cult and is said to guide them to Mokhaiotl. Return to Prince Itzla, who will explain that Mokhaiotl refers to the centre of the world, which is where it is said [[Ximoua]] will happen. As you discuss this with him, [[Forebearer Janus]] calls on the both of you to begin your trials.\n\n====The first trial====\n[[File:The Heart of Darkness - Emissaries' first trial.png|thumb|250px|The first trial of the Twilight Emissaries.]]\n{{Cquote2|The aim is simple: Speak the correct pass phrase to me and you will be allowed to proceed.}}\n\nYou will be in a room with three [[Emissary Ascended]]. Pickpocket one of them to obtain a [[Tower key (The Heart of Darkness)|tower key]], which is used to open the south-east gate. Search the chest to receive a [[Book (The Heart of Darkness)|book]] and [[scrap of paper]]. Take note of the first letter of each white word in the book, which is the passcode for the south-western chest; you will receive a [[poem]] and another scrap of paper.\n\nThe first word of each verse in the poem uses the language of the [[Old Ones]], translated as cardinal directions: Takam = East, Makt = North, Silam = West, Uitt = South. Reference the poem to get the order of arrows for the code for the last chest located in the North West part of the room. Enter the code to get the last scrap of paper. Combine the three for a [[completed note]], which contains a pass phrase.\n\nSpeak the pass phrase to Forebearer Janus to complete the first trial.\n\n====The second trial====\n[[File:The Heart of Darkness - Emissaries' second trial.png|thumb|250px|The second trial of the Twilight Emissaries.]]\n{{Cquote2|Welcome to your next trial. Here, there is one simple goal... Survive.}}\n\nThe second trial is combat-based, with [[Emissary Brawler]]s (melee) and [[Emissary Conjurer]]s (magic) attacking two at a time, then four at a time. The level 86 brawlers can use a special attack that strikes the tiles adjacent to them that can be dodged, while the conjurers can heal themselves and adjacent brawlers.\n\nBoth you and Prince Itzla must survive the trial; use the [[Bandages (The Heart of Darkness)|bandages]] from the [[medical box]]es around the room on him to heal.\n\nSpeak to Forebearer Janus again to start the third trial.\n\n====The third trial====\n[[File:The Heart of Darkness - Emissaries' third trial.png|thumb|250px|The third trial of the Twilight Emissaries.]]\n{{Cquote2|Welcome to your third trial. Before you stand some recently initiated acolytes. However, it seems one of them was not as loyal to our cause as first believed. Your task is to question all four and determine who the traitor is.}}\n\nThe third trial involves questioning the members of the cult - [[Tenoch]], [[Silia]], [[Adrius]], and [[Eleuia]] - and working out who the traitor is. Ask each about the Final Dawn; the traitor (different for each player) will be the one who talks about '''having eternal life in [[Ranul|Mictl]]'''. Once you question each member, you'll be given the option to accuse them while talking to them. If none of the members are the traitor, you may need to exit and re-enter the floor. \n\nIf the chosen member is the traitor, Janus will kill them rather than keep them barely alive; speak to him to begin the final trial.\n\n====The fourth trial====\n[[File:The Heart of Darkness - Emissaries' fourth trial.png|thumb|250px|The final trial of the Twilight Emissaries.]]\n{{Cquote2|Victory is within your reach, but one more trial awaits... Face your opponent.}}\n\nThe final trial requires you to battle Prince Itzla. He uses melee attacks, so [[Protect from Melee]] is advised. He will use protection prayers whenever you perform a [[special attack]], and uses two in turn, both of which he will warn you about in advance. For instance, he will pray [[Protect from Magic]] if a Voidwaker special is used.\n\nThe sword swipe special attack turns off any protection prayers, but you reactivate them immediately. The other is an AoE attack, once he warns you he is going to do it, run behind him immediately to dodge.\n\nUpon his defeat, speak to Janus to complete the trials.\n\n===The Ruins of Tapoyauik===\n{{Needed|up to 4 empty inventory slots (the icons can be done one at a time, but is recommended against)|recommended=Combat gear, Food, [[Prayer Potion]]s}}\n[[File:The Heart of Darkness - Metzli appears.png|thumb|250px|The Augur is revealed to be Metzli, the Teokan of Ranul.]]\nNow that you and Prince Itzla have passed the trials, the Augur herself will oversee the initiation process. Open the nearby chest to obtain the [[Emissary robes]], then wear them and make your way to the [[Twilight Temple]] to begin a cutscene. During the initation, it is revealed that the Augur is indeed [[Augur Metzli|Metzli]], the Teokan of Ranul, and claims [[Ennius Tullus|Ennius]] and [[Furia Tullus]] are the mortal forms of [[Ralos]] and [[Ranul]], who were reborn as the twins during an eclipse 31 years ago.\n\nAfter the cutscene, speak to [[Forebearer Fides]]. She will task you with opening up the passage to the [[Ruins of Tapoyauik]], a fortress of the [[Old Ones]] under the temple, where Metzli believes they left behind secrets to bring about the Final Dawn. Make your way to the building directly south, and climb down the stairs to the blocked passage; a [[barrel (Ruins of Tapoyauik)|barrel]] containing pickaxes can be found nearby to mine it.\n[[File:The Heart of Darkness - past blockage.png|thumb|250px|Frost nagua manifest before the cultists.]]\nUpon mining the blockage, a cutscene will play in which you proceed further into the fortress. However, the ground rumbles, manifesting two [[frost nagua]], killing [[Forebearer Vulcan]] and knocking Prince Itzla over a pit.\n\n'''''Note:''' Once you have completed the cutscene, you no longer need to wear the [[Emissary robes]] to proceed, unless you leave the area via teleport shortly after. They may be safely destroyed or deposited in a bank to free up inventory space, and reclaimed from the chest you found them in if you need to speak to Prince Itzla in the temple after returning.''\n\nYou will now need to navigate the fortress to meet up with Prince Itzla. Run past the frost nagua (use [[Protect from Magic]] if able), then avoid the spear traps; getting hit by one will stun you and deal 6-12 damage. Once past them, pull the [[Lever (Ruins of Tapoyauik)|lever]] and climb down the nearby ledge.\n[[File:The Heart of Darkness - navigating Tapoyauik.png|thumb|250px|Navigating the Ruins of Tapoyauik.]]\nNext, run past the [[frost crab]]s and make your way north, avoiding stepping on the [[Trap (Ruins of Tapoyauik)|traps]] by taking the middle path. You will come across a wall by an icy ledge that you can slide across. Once across, enter the north-eastern room and move around the trap before pulling the lever. Move west to the [[frozen platform]]s and cross them, then climb down the western ledge.\n\nHead west to the enclosed room and pull another lever, avoiding the trap. Head south to find a large gate and another lever to pull on the north side. Before entering, pull the chain just east to unlock a shortcut to the exit. If you need to leave and come back, climb down the stairs to enter the dungeon and head west to climb down this chain.\n\n====Icons Puzzle====\n\nWhen you walk west through the gate, you will find yourself in a large, rectangular room divided into thirds. The eastern third that you start in contains many urns and two murals. The middle third has a floor of ice and several frost nagua. The western third contains urns, another two murals, four statues, and a frozen door.\n\n'''Do not search the urns yet''' - whilst searching urns, frost naguas will spawn and attack and cannot be safespotted. Instead, inspect the two murals and take note of the first words used (zema, oma, yeya, naui) and the corresponding element that is visible on them. You will need to recall these word-element pairs soon. Then, run all the way west to meet up with Prince Itzla. He will help you fight any nagua that you bring near him.\n\nNow in the western third of the room, inspect the other two murals for their words and elements. Check which three of the statues are broken. Then, you will need to run back east again.\n\nIn the eastern third again, search the urns to find three distinct [[Icon (The Heart of Darkness)|icons]] which correspond to the broken statues that you inspected earlier. You will be ambushed by frost nagua while searching urns. Once you have all three icons, run west again.\n\nFinally, in the western third again, use the icons on their corresponding statues. Once you have done so, you will need to touch each of the four statues in the correct order. The words on the murals determine the order in which the player must touch the statues: Zema = 1, Oma = 2, Yeya = 3, and Naui = 4. Meanwhile, the elements on the murals determine the specific statue that must be touched. The order is different for each player. If all statues are touched, but in the incorrect order, you will take damage from falling rocks.\n\nUpon touching the statues correctly, they will unleash a wave spell and melt the ice off the door. The next section will be a boss fight, so return to a bank if needed.\n\n===Guardian of the Fortress===\n{{Needed|Combat gear|recommended=Food, [[Prayer Potion]]s and at least 37 prayer to use [[Protect from Magic]], [[Super combat potion]]s or similar, melee equipment to destroy ice blocks (Glacial temotli)}}\nEnter the door to begin a cutscene in which you and Prince Itzla encounter [[Amoxliatl]], a powerful frost nagua guarding the fortress. She will tell you and Itzla that the Mokhaiotl - or the Tlati archive - is off-limits to humans, claiming they are unworthy. Suddenly, Prince Itzla is teleported away, revealing that [[Metzli]], [[Ennius Tullus|Ennius]], and [[Furia Tullus|Furia]] followed you here. As they attempt to deal with you, Amoxliatl claims they have defiled Tapoyauik and will face the consequences. However, as they teleport away, you are forced to fight her in their stead.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nThe Heart of Darkness - Amoxliatl.png|The player and Prince Itzla encounter Amoxliatl.\nThe Heart of Darkness - Metzli and the Tullus twins.png|Metzli and the Tullus twins reveal themselves.\n</gallery>\n\nAmoxliatl uses three different attacks. In her standard attack, she attacks with magic, summoning ice spikes on the player's current tile and around the arena. [[Protect from Magic]] will protect against the initial attack, but the ice spikes additionally deal typeless damage. Finally, an icy pool will be left on the tile where the player was originally standing that will deal 6-10 damage per tick.\n[[File:Fighting Amoxliatl.png|thumb|250px|The player fights Amoxliatl, the guardian of Tapoyauik.]]\nAfter every 2-4 standard attacks, Amoxliatl will use one of two special attacks. The first one used is randomly selected, but after that, she will alternate between them and will not use the same special attack twice in a row. If you are standing in the narrow entry path, she will not use her Unstable Ice special attack.\n\n* Unstable ice blocks: Amoxliatl forms 1-4 blocks of unstable ice around the arena. If not destroyed in time (16 ticks, ~10 seconds), all remaining ice blocks will shatter, causing icy pools to form within 3x3 of the ice blocks and healing the boss (16-25) for each ice block shattered. Ice Blocks can only be destroyed with melee, but will be fully destroyed in 1 tick regardless of the melee weapon used.\n\n* Icicle attack: Amoxliatl disables the player's prayer and launches an icicle at them. A message is shown in the chatbox: {{mes|Amoxliatl disables your prayers and launches an icicle attack!|colour=red}} Turn on [[Protect from Magic]] before the icicle hits you to negate all damage.\n\nAfter defeating Amoxliatl, you will forcefully be banished from Tapoyauik. Make your way to [[Sunrise Palace]], where [[Servius]] is currently staying. You will inform him of the events that transpired, and he will ask that you leave so as to avoid the Queen's anger, but assures you that you will be involved in whatever plans are made next.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|image=[[File:The_Heart_of_Darkness_reward_scroll.png|centre]]|name=The Heart of Darkness|qp=2|rewards=\n*Access to [[Tapoyauik]]\n*{{SCP|Mining|8,000}} [[Mining]] experience\n*{{SCP|Thieving|8,000}} [[Thieving]] experience \n*{{SCP|Slayer|8,000}} [[Slayer]] experience\n*{{SCP|Agility|8,000}} [[Agility]] experience.\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\" style=\"text-align:left\">\nThe Heart of Darkness - Twilight Temple wallkit concept art.png|Concept art of the [[Twilight Temple]] wallkit, by [[Mod Jerv]].\nRuins of Tapoyauik concept art.png|Concept art of the [[Ruins of Tapoyauik]], by Mod Jerv.\nAmoxliatl chamber entrance concept art.png|Concept art of the entrance leading to Amoxliatl's chamber, by Mod Jerv.\nAmoxliatl chamber concept art.png|Concept art of Amoxliatl's chamber, by Mod Jerv.\nThe Heart of Darkness - prince disguises concept art.png|Concept art of Prince Itzla's disguises, by Mod Jerv.\nThe Heart of Darkness - Augur Metzli concept art.png|Concept art of Augur Metzli, by Mod Jerv.\nThe Heart of Darkness - cultist twins concept art.png|Concept art of the Tullus twins during the quest, by Mod Jerv.\nThe Heart of Darkness - cultist NPCs concept art.png|Concept art of the cultists, by Mod Jerv.\nThe Heart of Darkness - cultist combatants concept art.png|Concept art of the cultist combatants, by Mod Jerv.\n</gallery>\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 9 October 2024\n|update = Wintertodt Updates & Varlamore Drop Rates\n|poll =\n|change = New dialogue is added to make it clearer when the trial is being reset upon failing to pick the traitor.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 2 October 2024\n|update = Rewards and XP Improvements - Varlamore: The Rising Darkness\n|poll =\n|change = [[Frost Nagua]] will no longer respawn during the door puzzle segment after being killed.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The act of trying to rent a non-existent basement room at the Windbreaker is possibly a reference to the quest [https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Horn_of_Jurgen_Windcaller The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller] from ''{{WP|The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim}}''.

If you meet the requirements, she will acknowledge your questing prowess and set you the entry tasks. She will tell you that in order to get in you need to give her three items: a [[fire feather]] from an [[Entrana firebird]], a cooked [[lava eel]], and a [[Thieves' armband|Master Thieves' Armband]].\n\nFor the armband, she suggests you probably have 'relevant contacts' yourself with whom to enquire about it. To obtain the feather she only offers the most helpful advice that Entranan firebirds tend to live on [[Entrana]]. To get the eel, she advises you to talk to someone who knows a lot about fishing.\n\nThe items may be obtained in any order, but must be given to Achietties simultaneously.\n\n===Master Thieves' armband===\n{{Map|2771,3194|mtype=rectangle|rectX=24|rectY=12|caption=The location of Scarface Pete's mansion in Brimhaven.|align=right|width=250|height=250}}\nTo earn the armband, you will have to contact your old gang associates from the [[Shield of Arrav]] quest, as indicated by the quest journal. For this part of the quest, you will need the help of a player of the opposite gang. Players that have completed the quest may go back and help others. For finding a quest partner, the [[Grouping]] interface is useful. You can also usually find a partner on the [[chat-channel]] 'Osrs Soa' during peak hours.\n\n:'''Note:''' For this part of the quest you '''do not''' need to meet the skill requirements. This means you can complete this part of the quest in order to help a friend complete their entire quest; see [[Heroes' Quest#Trivia|Trivia]] for more details. You can even help a friend if you have already completed the quest yourself.\n:'''Note:''' Traded Pete's candlesticks will not be accepted if the presenter did not kill Grip. As such, do not get scammed into buying or taking free candlesticks unless you are a Phoenix Gang member and can kill Grip. Black Arm gang members can never kill Grip so they should not accept traded candlesticks under any circumstances. Likewise, a [[miscellaneous key]] without a Black Arm member to lure Grip is useless. Do not get scammed into buying miscellaneous keys.\n\n====Black Arm Gang member====\n[[File:Katrine chathead.png|left]]\n'''''Items required:''' A [[black full helm]], a [[black platebody]] and [[black platelegs]]. The helm and legs can be purchased from the [[Champions' Guild]] and the platebody can be obtained from [[Horvik's Armour Shop]] in [[Varrock]]. '''Note:''' a black plate''skirt'' or trimmed black armour will not work, whether your character is female or not.''\n\nGo to Varrock and talk to [[Katrine]] who is inside the [[Black Arm Gang Headquarters]], which is situated in the south-west of the city. She tells you that you need to do something amazing in order to attain the rank of master thief. She explains some of the most coveted items for thieves are in [[Brimhaven]]. The leader of the pirates there is one [[Scarface Pete]]. She will tell you that you have to steal his very valuable [[Pete's candlestick|candlesticks]] and that his security is very good.\n\nYou have to visit the Black Arm members in their hideout in the alleyway of Palm Street. The gang's password is \"''four leafed{{sic}} clover\".''\n\n=====The Hideout on Palm Street=====\nGo to Brimhaven and find the gang office, which is the building along the fence, east of the two inns and south of the [[Brimhaven Agility Arena|Agility Arena]]. Give [[Grubor]] the password at the door, and inside speak to [[Trobert]], the leader of the Black Arms in Brimhaven. Trobert explains one of the only keys to Pete's treasure room is carried by his head guard [[Grip]], who was taking on a new deputy called [[Hartigen]], a deserter of the [[Kinshra|Black Knights]] seeking employment in Brimhaven. The Black Arms have waylaid Hartigen and stolen his identification papers. Volunteer to impersonate Hartigen. He will give you the [[Id papers]], which you will need to get into Scarface Pete's mansion, and tell you to introduce yourself to its guards.\n\nSpeak to [[Garv]], who is the guard patrolling along the southern wall of the large building on Brimhaven's western side. He will not believe you are Hartigen, stating that the Black Knight dressed differently. Equip a full set of [[black armour]]: full helm, platebody and platelegs. Garv will then allow you to go inside tells you to speak to Grip.\n\n=====Getting a Grip on the key=====\n[[File:Talking to Grip.png|thumb|250x250px|Grip explaining your duties.]]\nOnce inside, talk to [[Grip]]. He explains you will be working various guard duties, and that the important keys are in Grip's jacket. Ask him \"So what do my duties involve?\" and then \"Anything I can do now?\" and he will give you a [[Miscellaneous key]].\n\n'''Note:''' If you have already done the quest and have the Miscellaneous key in your bank, he will not give you a new one.\n\nGrip won't allow you to enter the treasure room and you can't kill him without drawing attention to yourself. This means you will need an accomplice. Leave the building and trade the key to your [[Phoenix Gang]] partner.\n\n=====Handling the candlesticks=====\n[[File:Heroes'_Quest_-_Attacking_Grip.png|thumb|250x250px|A player attacking [[Grip]].]]\nBack inside, head into the north-eastern room from the entrance. Wait for your partner to get to the room behind the eastern wall, behind the arrowslit; then, search the [[cupboard (Heroes' Quest)|cupboard]]. A [[pirate guard]] will say that Grip really doesn't like his drinks cabinet being touched, but open it anyway. Grip will then come into the room, telling you to get your hands off his drinks. Make sure the door is open. Grip can become stuck on the guards in the room, so you may need to wait or kill some guards to create space or else Grip may be blocked and leave the room. If this happens, just search the cupboard again.\n\nYour Phoenix Gang partner will then kill Grip through the slit from the hidden room. Once he dies, pick up [[Grip's keyring]]. \n\nUsing the key, go to the treasure room (the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} room with coins on the floor next to the staircase in the north-west corner) and open the north chest in the first room to receive two candlesticks. '''Give one candlestick to your Phoenix Gang partner.'''\n\nGo back to Varrock and talk to Katrine. She will give you the [[Thieves' armband]].\n\n:'''Note:''' The door to the treasure room will not open and give you a message if you attempt to open it with Grip's keyring without having obtained a miscellaneous key at least once.\n:'''Note:''' The chest containing Pete's candlesticks (position to the north) will be empty if you have a candlestick in your inventory or bank. If you have a traded one in the bank, you will need to discard it then come back to search this chest as you will not be able to turn in a traded candlestick to Katrine at any time.\n:'''Note:''' Be sure to pick up the candlesticks yourself; otherwise, Katrine will say you weren't the one to retrieve the candlestick and you will have to go back to do it all over again.\n:'''Note:''' Grip's Keyring is unique to the player you are doing the quest with. If you complete the quest and are retrieving candlesticks for a different player and still have Grip's Keyring, drop it and ask him for a new one.\n\n====Phoenix Gang member====\n'''''Items required:''' A [[Ranged weapons|ranged weapon]] and [[ammo]] ([[brutal arrows]] will not work) or [[runes]] for [[Magic]].''\n[[File:Straven chathead.png|left]]\nGo to [[Varrock]] and speak to [[Straven]] at the hideout. Enquire about becoming a master thief. He will explain that some eager gang members are trying to steal the valuable candlesticks of [[Scarface Pete]], the pirate leader of [[Brimhaven]]. He gives you the password ''gherkin'' to tell [[Alfonse the waiter|Alfonse]], a gang member posing as a waiter in [[The Shrimp and Parrot]] inn.\n\nGet a [[bow]] and [[arrows]], or magic gear if using magic, before heading to [[Brimhaven]].\n\n=====The side entrance=====\nGo to the Shrimp and Parrot restaurant in Brimhaven. Once you are there, talk to Alfonse the waiter and ask about gherkins. He will wink and redirect you to [[Charlie the cook]] in the back room. Give him the password as well and tell him you are after Pete's candlesticks. Charlie the cook will tell you that the restaurant was set up as part of the heist. There is a secret wall-door that opens into [[Mr. Olbors]]'s garden that you are able to push to open. Across the garden is an old side entrance into the mansion that has since been blocked. However, the Phoenixes are unable to get hold of the key to that door. The pushable wall is in the kitchen, in the same room as where Charlie is. Beware of Mr. Olbors's [[guard dog]]s.\n\n'''Get a [[miscellaneous key]] from your [[Black Arm Gang]] partner.''' Head into Olbors's garden and enter the mansion's eastern door. Once inside, use the miscellaneous key on the northern door. This brings you in a cramped room with an arrowslit into a room with a cupboard. Shoot through the hole in the wall at [[Grip]] and kill him with [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. Your partner will have to lure him inside the room by rummaging through his drinks cabinet. Grip will drop the key for your Black Arm Gang partner.\n\n'''Your Black Arm Gang partner will get two [[Pete's candlestick|candlesticks]] and should trade you one of them.'''\n\n'''Note:''' You must actually kill Grip! If you don't, Straven will ''NOT'' accept your candlestick. Don't buy it or the key off other players as shortcut; you can't kill Grip alone.\n\nGo back to Varrock and give the candlestick to Straven to get the [[Thieves' armband]].\n\n===Entrana firebird feather===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ice gloves]], or a [[pickaxe]] and combat equipment if you do not already own a pair. [[Dwarven Stout]] if boosting mining.''\n\nIf you want, speak to a [[monk]] in the Entranan church about the firebird. He does not think they exist but redirects you to the head monk, who is more knowledgeable. The [[High Priest (Entrana)|High Priest]] tells you that the bird lives somewhere on Entrana, and that you will need some cold gloves to pick up its feather.\n\nThe [[firebird]] lives on the northern half of [[Entrana]]. It is very weak and easy to kill. However, its [[fire feather]] is too hot to pick up; you require something cold in order to do so. In order to pick up the [[fire feather]], you'll need [[ice gloves]]. They are dropped by the level 111 [[Ice Queen]] located underneath [[White Wolf Mountain]]. If you do not own ice gloves, see the section below.\n\nOnce you have a pair of ice gloves, bank your weapons and armour, but keep the gloves, obviously. Head to [[Entrana]] and kill the firebird near the [[Law Altar]]. Make sure to have the ice gloves equipped before picking up the feather.\n\nYou can also grab a fishing rod from the house beside the fishing platform on the south east corner of the island if you need a spare to use for making the oily fishing rod. \n\n====Ice Spy with my Little Eye====\n[[File:Heroes'_Quest_-_Rockslide.png|thumb|250x250px|Compass pointing north; location of the rockslide to get into the lair.]]\n'''''Recommended:''' [[Energy potion|Energy]]/[[stamina potion]]s.''\n\nIf you do not already own [[Ice gloves]], go to White Wolf Mountain (east of [[Catherby]], west of [[Taverley]]), to the rock slide on the north side. It can be found just north-west of the [[gnome glider]]. Otherwise, enter the mountain at the southern entrance and walk or run north until you come to the rock slide.\n\nUse a [[pickaxe]] on the rock slide and go through it (this requires 50 [[Mining]] and can be boosted). Once you are through, you will be near level 57 [[ice warrior]]s and three ladders.\n\n[[File:Heroes'_Quest_-_Ice_Queen's_Lair_route.png|thumb|220x220px|left|A map of the [[Ice Queen's Lair]].]]\n(confusing context: Just mine the rock and follow the path)\n\nUse the southern ladder and go down the south-western tunnel. Go up the ladder just after the tunnel bends north. Once you go up, you will see level 53 [[ice giant]]s there. Take the eastern ladder down. Go north through the long tunnel with level 61 [[ice spider]]s and ice giants (the spiders in the tunnel do not show up on [[minimap]]). The tunnel makes a loop and ends at a ladder. Go up the ladder, then go down the other. Continue down the tunnel until it opens up into a large room full of ice warriors and the [[Ice Queen]]. Be careful because this is a [[multicombat area]], so you will be attacked by multiple enemies at once!\n\nIf you stand behind the throne, you can avoid the ice warriors and can still attack the Ice Queen if positioned right. Kill her and she will drop the ice gloves. Once you have the gloves, exit using the same route back or teleport out.\n\n===Cooked lava eel===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[fishing rod]], [[fishing bait]], [[harralander potion (unf)]] (or a [[harralander]] and [[vial of water]]), [[fishing boost]] (if needed), other items depending on chosen location (see below), dusty key.''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' [[Energy potion|energy]]/[[stamina potion]]s. If you do not have 25 herblore, bring your [[botanical pie]].''\n[[File:Heroes' Quest Gerrant.png|thumb|250px|Speaking to the fishing expert about catching a lava eel.]]\nGo to [[Port Sarim]] and talk to [[Gerrant]] at the [[fishing shop]]. He says lava eels are tricky to catch and require a fireproof line. He will give you a bottle of [[blamish snail slime]] used to make an oil to treat a fishing rod. He says the oil is made by mixing the slime with harralander and water. Buy a fishing rod and some bait from him if you haven't got any yet.\n\nOnce you have the items, use the [[harralander]] on the [[vial of water]] and then add the blamish snail slime (this is the portion that requires 25 Herblore). Right-click the [[blamish oil]] and use it on a normal [[fishing rod]] to get an [[oily fishing rod]].\n\nThere are '''two possible locations''' where you can catch [[Raw lava eel|lava eels]]: the [[Taverley Dungeon]] or the [[Wilderness]] [[Lava Maze]]. It is highly recommended that you go to Taverley Dungeon as it is much safer than travelling to levels 40-45 in the Wilderness to reach the Lava Maze and may be well worth it considering you will have to start over again and recollect supplies if you get [[Player killing|pk'ed]] there. Don't forget your [[dusty key]], [[anti-dragon shield]] and possibly [[antifire potion]]s if you are going the Taverley Dungeon route! Also, don't forget your fishing boost such as an [[admiral pie]] for either route if you require it.\n\n====Taverley Dungeon====\n'''''Items required:''' The [[dusty key]] (if you don't have 70 [[Agility]]) - can be obtained in the dungeon, [[oily fishing rod]], [[bait]], fishing boost if using.''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' The [[anti-dragon shield]] or a [[dragonfire shield]] and [[antifire potion]]. Also bring [[food]] or make sure you have ample prayer points for [[Protect from Melee]] if low-levelled.''\n[[File:Heroes'_Quest_-_Taverley_Dungeon_route.png|thumb|250px|Routes to the lava eels and dusty key.]]\nBring your [[fishing rod]], [[Fishing bait|bait]], and other items. Take the [[Balloon transport system|balloon]] to Taverley, or teleport to [[Falador]] and walk west over the [[Agility]] [[shortcut]] (requires 5 Agility) or through the main gate, or teleport to your house if it is in [[Taverley]].\n\n'''If you have 70 Agility''' (which can be boosted), enter the pipe (be sure to wear your [[anti-dragon shield]]) and run south. The [[fishing spot]] is near some [[baby blue dragon]]s. Catch a [[Raw lava eel|lava eel]].\n\n'''If you don't have 70 Agility''', follow the magenta path on the image to the right. Walk through the dungeon and use the [[dusty key]] on the door between the [[lesser demon]]s and [[blue dragon]]s. If you have 63 Agility, you can save a bit of time by squeezing through loose railings to go straight to the lesser demon area.\n\nIf you don't have the dusty key, go past the bridge, continue south-west past the [[hill giant]]s, and you will enter the [[Black Knights' Base]]. Go to the east into a jail, kill the [[jailer]] and then pick up his key. Use it on the jail cell holding [[Velrak the explorer]]. Ask him if there are any good places to explore to get the dusty key. Head back north past the hill giants and follow the magenta path to the fishing spot. Use the key on the door between the lesser demons and blue dragons. The fishing spot is near some baby blue dragons; from here, catch a lava eel.\n\n====Lava Maze====\n'''''Items required:''' A [[knife]] or a [[slash weapon]] (use any [[Wilderness sword]] for fastest completion), [[oily fishing rod]], [[fishing bait]], fishing boost if using.''\n{{Map|name=Lava Maze|3070,3853|zoom=1|align=right|height=180|width=280|caption=A map of the Lava Maze.}}\n\n'''{{Colour|Red|Warning}}:''' The [[Lava Maze]] is located in deep [[Wilderness]]. Beware of any [[player killer]]s. They can commonly be found at the maze and will most likely have the level range to [[Player killing|pk]] you. You may likely lose any quest items you are carrying and may end up needing to gather the items to make another [[oily fishing rod]]. Make sure to bring some food in case someone does try to kill you and make sure you are ready to fight!\n\nAt this point, travel to the nearest bank and stash anything that you don't intend on losing.\n\nIf you're going to the [[Fishing spots|fishing spot]] in the [[Lava Maze]], there are several methods of reaching it:\n\n*Teleporting there with the [[burning amulet]]. This is the quickest way.\n*Casting the [[Ghorrock Teleport]] spell (or [[Ghorrock teleport|tablet]]) in the [[Ancient Magicks]] spellbook, although this requires completing the quest [[Desert Treasure I]].\n*Use a [[Canoe|waka canoe]] from [[Edgeville]] into the Wilderness. This requires 57 [[Woodcutting]]. From there, simply walk west to arrive near the entrance.\n*Use the [[Wilderness Obelisk]]s to arrive in level 35 or 44 Wilderness. Either teleport will place you close to the entrance of the maze.\n\nMake your way through the aggressive [[black knight]]s at the entrance. Make your way through the maze until the fishing icon appears on your minimap. This is where the [[lava eels]] are caught.\n[[File:Catching a lava eel.png|thumb|220px|Fishing in the lava.]]\nFishing a lava eel here will also complete a Hard [[Wilderness Diary]] task.\n\nOnce you catch a [[raw lava eel]], cook it over a [[fire]] or a [[range]] ({{SCP|Cooking}}53+ [[Cooking]]). You can boost your cooking level with a [[Chef's delight]] ({{SCP|Cooking}}50+ [[Cooking]]) or [[Chef's delight(m)]] ({{SCP|Cooking}}49+ [[Cooking]]).\n\n'''Note:''' Lava eels do not burn when cooked (or, indeed, when swimming in lava). Do not worry about obtaining multiple eels if you are worried about burning one.\n\n===Quest end===\nGo back to the [[Heroes' Guild]], talk to [[Achietties]] outside and give her the three collected items.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Heroes' Quest|image=[[File:Heroes' Quest reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=1|rewards=*{{SCP|Attack|3,075}} [[Attack]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Defence|3,075}} [[Defence]] experience\n*{{SCP|Strength|3,075}} [[Strength]] experience\n*{{SCP|Hitpoints|3,075}} [[Hitpoints]] experience\n*{{SCP|Ranged|2,075}} [[Ranged]] experience\n*{{SCP|Fishing|2,725}} [[Fishing]] experience\n*{{SCP|Cooking|2,825}} [[Cooking]] experience\n*{{SCP|Woodcutting|1,575}} [[Woodcutting]] experience\n*{{SCP|Firemaking|1,575}} [[Firemaking]] experience\n*{{SCP|Smithing|2,275}} [[Smithing]] experience\n*{{SCP|Mining|2,575}} [[Mining]] experience\n*{{SCP|Herblore|1,325}} [[Herblore]] experience\n*Access to the [[Heroes' Guild]]\n*The ability to purchase and wield [[dragon battleaxe]]s and [[Dragon mace|maces]]\n*Ability to recharge [[amulets of glory]] at the [[Fountain of Rune]] (This grants 6 charges instead of the usual 4)\n*Ability to use [[Charge dragonstone jewellery scroll]]s.\n*Access to the [[Fountain of Heroes]], where players can recharge their [[amulets of glory]]}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Heroes' Quest is required for the following:\n*[[Throne of Miscellania]]\n*[[Legends' Quest]]\n*[[Recipe for Disaster]]\n*[[The Fremennik Exiles]]\n*[[Falador Diary#Hard|Hard Falador Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 5 October 2022\n|update = Clan Hall Upgrades & More\n|change = Heroes' Quest has been fixed for players stuck in a broken state.

First, you can enter the mansion without your full [[black armour]] and ask [[Grip]] for another [[miscellaneous key]] for your partner - to get another key, first ask him what your duties involve before asking \"what can I do now?\". Open the cabinet and allow Grip to walk into the room. Shut the door and trap him and the Phoenix Gang member '''must''' kill Grip. This will update their quest journal for the Heroes' Quest.\n*Members of the Phoenix Gang who have already completed the quest also have the ability to help others who have not, and are members of the Black Arm Gang. Either use the miscellaneous key received while completing the quest initially, or get a new one from the Black Arm Gang member. Return through [[The Shrimp and Parrot]] restaurant to the kitchen, and then through the secret panel. Head past the [[guard dog]]s again and into mansion. Use the miscellaneous key on the door, and kill Grip once the Black Arm Gang member has lured him into position.\n*After [[Grip]] is killed and before he respawns if the player searches the cupboard they will find [[Whisky]].\n*Attempting to drink the blamish oil results in the player saying \"You know... I'd really rather not.\"\n*Heroes' Quest was the first quest to have other quests specifically required to be completed, although [[Black Knights' Fortress]] and [[Dragon Slayer I]] had quest point requirements first.\n*Other than Crafting, Magic, and Prayer, Heroes' Quest gives experience rewards to all skills that were in the game at the time of its release.\n\n{{Heroes' Quest}}\n{{Heroes' Guild}}"

Speak to the [[High Priest (Entrana)|high priest]] of the church. He will say the holy grail is no longer here. Then, a [[Crone|strange old crone]] will appear and say that [[Fisher King]] is in trouble and to help him you must find where the six [[Mysterious statue|stone heads]] around the world point to and blow a [[magic whistle]] there.\n\n{{Map|name=Galahad|x=2613|y=3477|r=4|mtype=square|caption=[[Galahad]]'s house west of [[McGrubor's Wood]]s and [[Camelot]].|width=250|height=250|align=right}}\n[[File:Holy Grail - Taking the Whistle.png|thumb|left|200px|Taking the [[magic whistle]].]]\nReturn to [[Camelot]] (you can teleport or use a [[combat bracelet]] to teleport to the [[Ranging Guild]]); then, go to [[Galahad]] who's located in a house west of [[McGrubor's Wood]]. Tell him you're looking for an item from the [[Fisher Realm]], and he will reluctantly give you a [[holy table napkin]], a souvenir he took from the Fisher Realm. ''(If you talk to Galahad and use the option of asking him if he ever gets lonely, he will give you a cup of tea, which you can drink to complete a task in the [[Kandarin easy diary]])''\n\nNow, head to the top floor of [[Draynor Manor]] into the southern room. You need to have the holy table napkin with you, or you can't see the whistle respawn. Pick up '''two''' magic whistles (another is needed later, but can also be obtained in the Fisher Realm).

Aside from a player-planted [[spirit tree]], the fastest way to [[Brimhaven]] is using a [[scroll of redirection]] on a [[Teleport to house (tablet)|teleport to house tablet]] and directing it to Brimhaven. The second best method is teleporting to [[Ardougne]], or [[house]] (if your house is in [[Rimmington]]), and talking to [[Captain Barnaby]] in southern [[Ardougne]], on the docks, for 30 gold. You can also take a [[charter ship]] to Brimhaven from [[Port Sarim]] and the [[Catherby]] docks, this costs 1,600gp and 480gp respectively. You can also use the [[Fishing Trawler]] [[minigame teleport]] to easily take a charter ship (1,600 gp) to Brimhaven. You can also use your [[amulet of glory]] to teleport to Musa Point and run west, or use [[fairy ring]] code {{fairycode|BLP}} or the TzHaar Fight Pit minigame teleport to go to [[Mor Ul Rek]], the city of the [[TzHaar]] inside the volcano. Lastly, you can pay 30 coins to take a ship from Port Sarim to Musa Point and then walk to Brimhaven.\n\nAfter arriving in Brimhaven, head north-west of the town, where the [[North Brimhaven mine|goldmine]] is. Look for a guard tower north of where the [[gold rocks]] are. \n\n<small>(Bring a pickaxe and you can complete a task in the Karamja easy diary by mining a piece of gold here. You can also complete another Karamja easy diary task nearby, simply by taking the rope swing to the small island with the Giants on it, and then using the rope swing to then come back.)</small> \n\nGo under the tower and blow one of the magic whistles, and you will be teleported to the [[Fisher King's Realm]]. If you are below [[Combat level]] 41, be sure to bring [[Antipoison]] because there are level 20 [[poisonous]] [[scorpion]]s.\n\n[[File:Holy Grail - Fighting the Black Knight Titan.png|thumb|right|Fighting the [[Black Knight Titan]].]]\nNow, you need to get across a bridge to speak to the [[Fisher King]]. The [[Black Knight Titan]] stands there and won't let you through without a match. The titan can hit up to 15, so be prepared. The titan must be killed with the [[Excalibur]] blade only, although you may use other weapons to bring down his health (it is possible to kill him with a different weapon, however you must quickly switch to [[Excalibur]]). The titan has no specific weakness to an [[attack style]], but he is resistant to [[Ranged]] and [[Magic]] attacks, hence it is recommended to use [[Melee]]. If the finishing strike is not from the Excalibur, you will have to face him again. (If you have a low level combat, it is possible to use the [[hit-and-run]] method, as the titan does not move. You can simply hit him once and then walk a square back.) If you use a [[halberd]], you can just defeat him from a block away. (You can [[safespot]] with magic, stand 4 units east, and 1 unit north from the titan.) '''For [[Ironmen]]''': It's possible for another player to teleport into your Fisher Realm instance and attack the titan if you are flinching. '''This will cause you to have to fight the titan all over again.  It is also possible to Woox walk the titan and not take any hits.'''\n\nAfter you have killed the titan, cross the bridge and head south along the river till you find a [[Fisherman]]. Speak to him and ask how to get inside the castle. He will tell you that you need to ring a bell. Head to the castle (south-west from the fisherman), and there will be a [[grail bell]] on the ground in front of the entrance. Ring it, progress through the dialogue, and you will be inside the castle, pick up the magic whistle on the floor (you will need a second one later). Note that if you leave the Fisher King's Realm after talking to the fisherman but before you retrieve the grail bell, you will need to talk to the fisherman again to get the grail bell.\n\nHead upstairs and speak to the Fisher King. Choose every chat option because if you miss one, you may have to kill the titan again. He is very sick and wishes to see his son once more. The son's name is [[Percival]], and he is a knight of the round table. Now, blow your whistle again to be teleported out, or teleport directly to [[Camelot]] if you have the runes.\n\n===Finishing up===\n{{Needed|Both [[magic whistle]]s.|recommended=[[Falador Teleport|Falador teleport]], [[Camelot Teleport|Camelot teleport]], and [[Ardougne Teleport|Ardougne teleport]] or [[fairy rings]] teleport. Bring antipoison if under combat level 41.}}\n\nHead to [[Camelot]], and speak to [[King Arthur]]. Though he does not know where [[Percival]] is, he gives you a [[magic gold feather]], which points to the gold boots Percival was wearing.\n\n[[File:Holy Grail - Talking to Sir Percival.png|thumb|right|Finding [[Sir Percival]].]]\nBlow on the feather, and it will guide you towards [[Goblin Village]]. Teleport to [[Falador]], and head north. Once at the Goblin Village, head into the east house and open (do not just prod) the sacks, and you will find Sir Percival (you need to have the feather in your inventory to open the sacks). Tell him that his father wishes to see him.

Enter the cave and walk north, then west until you find two [[Goblin guard (Land of the Goblins)|goblin guards]] guarding the entrance to the temple. Drink a dose of [[goblin potion]] and enter the temple. '''Do not equip the ghostspeak amulet and ring of visibility yet, or you will revert to human form and be expelled from the temple.'''\n[[File:Goblin Temple crypt.png|thumb|280px|The crypt of the Goblin Temple.]]\nMake your way to the crypt within the [[Goblin Temple]], and once inside then equip the [[ghostspeak amulet]] and [[ring of visibility]] or [[Ring of shadows]]. You will see the ghost of [[Hopespear]], the goblin prophet. Ask him why he is here, and he will tell you that he is waiting for the [[Big High War God]] to take his spirit to [[Yu'biusk]].\n\nTell him that you have been to Yu'biusk, and he will ask you for a favour: to free the souls of the goblin high priests. To do this, you must complete a ritual which includes killing the goblin priests, without the use of weapons, spells, or armour, and retrieving their bones to be buried in Yu'biusk. \n\n'''Remove any items you have equipped''' or else the goblin high priests will not drop their bones upon defeat. This includes any equipment that gives stat bonuses, and jewellery like [[Ring of recoil|rings of recoil]]. Attempting to cheese the fights with stat-less [[attack speed]] enhancing weapons such as the [[Ham joint]] or [[Goblin paint cannon]] will not work either. However, the [[ghostspeak amulet]] and [[ring of visibility]] or [[ring of shadows]] can still be worn. \n\nNow summon and battle the five high priests as done during [[Land of the Goblins]] by speaking their name over their grave. Unlike the quest, the high priests can be fought in any order. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|Priest\n!Level\n!Grave location\n!Attack Style\n|-\n|[[File:Snothead chathead.png|center|x55px]]\n|[[Snothead]]\n|32\n|South-west\n|Melee\n|-\n|[[File:Snailfeet chathead.png|center|x55px]]\n|[[Snailfeet]]\n|56\n|South-east\n|Melee and Ranged\n|-\n|[[File:Mosschin chathead.png|center|x55px]]\n|[[Mosschin]]\n|88\n|North-west\n|Melee, and Magic\n|-\n|[[File:Redeyes chathead.png|center|x55px]]\n|[[Redeyes]]\n|121\n|North-east\n|Melee, Magic and Ranged (Lowers Attack, Strength and Defence)\n|-\n|[[File:Strongbones chathead.png|center|x55px]]\n|[[Strongbones]]\n|184\n|North\n|Melee, Magic, and Ranged. Summons level 29 [[skoblin]]s, and lowers Attack, Strength and Defence\n|}\n\n[[Strongbones]] is by far the hardest of the high priests. To take him on it is recommended to have at least level 70 melee stats along with 70 Prayer for [[Piety]], or slightly higher melee stats if using [[Chivalry]]. Redeyes and Strongbones will also periodically lower your Attack, Strength and Defence, so a few regular [[Super combat potion|super combat potions]] are also advised to keep boosting throughout the fight. Strongbones will hit up to 18 regularly so bring as much high-healing food as possible, as well as 2-3 prayer potions (3-4 if around 70 melee stats) to keep up [[Protect from Melee]] and Piety. Having access to the [[Ring of shadows]] over the [[Ring of visibility]] will also aid in boosting combat stats. \n\n'''Note:''' You can recharge your prayer inbetween fights at the altar outside of the crypt, provided you still have doses of your goblin potion. Drink a dose of it before leaving the tomb. You also do not have to defeat all the high priests in one go; you can leave the crypt to restock and bank any bones collected thus far. '''When returning, another dose of goblin potion is needed to enter the crypt but the ghostspeak amulet and ring of visibility are not needed'''. If you die fighting any of the high priests, you will lose any bones in your inventory and they will not be protected by your gravestone, so you must fight them again. Your gravestone will appear in the [[Goblin Cave]], near the stairs leading to the temple, thus, you do not need another dose of goblin potion to reclaim your items. \n\n'''Note:''' You must pick up each goblin's set of bones before killing the next, as the new goblin's death will cause the old goblin's bones to despawn. \n\nFinally, use [[fairy ring]] code {{fairycode|BLQ}} to reach Yu'biusk, and once there bury the bones. Players do not need to bury all five sets of bones at once. Burying all of the bones will complete the miniquest.   \n\nThe rewarded XP for each priest is as following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|Priest bone!!{{SCP|Prayer|link=yes}} experience\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Snothead's bone}}||1,250\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Snailfeet's bone}}||2,500\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Mosschin's bone}}||5,000\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Redeyes' bone}}||10,000\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Strongbones' bone}}||20,000\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total||{{SCP|Prayer|38,750}}\n|}\nThese bones do '''not''' benefit from the increased experience bonus granted after burning [[chewed bones]] on a [[pyre ship]], nor can they be converted using the [[Sinister Offering]] spell.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|miniquest}}\n\n==Historical==\nHopespear's Will was released in ''RuneScape'' on [[12 November]] [[2007]] alongside Land of the Goblins. Both this miniquest and its parent quest were extracted from the [[August 2007 Archive of RuneScape]] that ''Old School RuneScape'' is built off of. Compared to the original, the ''Old School'' version has a few differences:\n* Level 50 Prayer is required to start the miniquest, rather than level 40 in ''RuneScape''.\n* The total amount of Prayer experience rewarded is 38,750, rather than 13,750 in ''RuneScape''.\n* The goblin high priests are significantly stronger than their ''RuneScape'' counterparts.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Hopespear's Will is the first miniquest from the original game to be ported to ''Old School RuneScape'' since the start of the game.\n\n{{Hopespear's Will}}\n{{Land of the Goblins}}\n{{Miniquests}}\n[[Category:Backported and extracted content]]"

A fairy ring is located right next to the lighthouse (fairy ring code {{Fairycode|ALP}}). Her boyfriend, the lighthouse keeper, has disappeared and left the lighthouse locked whilst the lights are out. She is worried about him and explains that she has been cut off from the mainland [[Fremennik Province]] by a storm that destroyed the bridge to the east. She asks you to find her cousin, who has a spare key to the lighthouse, and to repair the bridge so she can tell her family what is going on. Agree to help her and ask what she wants.\n\n[[Larrissa]] explains that her cousin, [[Gunnjorn]], left their home in [[Rellekka]] to pursue his interest in practising [[Agility]]. Head to the [[Barbarian Outpost]], for example using a [[Games necklace]] or the [[Grouping]] interface. Alternatively, go down south of her jumping across the [[Basalt rock|basalt platforms]] and into the Barbarian Outpost. If planning on using the basalt rocks, bring food as it has a high failure rate even with decent agility.\n:*'''Note to 10 HP accounts''': The basalt path can hit up to 10, regardless of your Hitpoints level.\n\nTalk to [[Gunnjorn]] at the Barbarian Outpost [[Agility]] course past the pipe and tell him Larrissa is in trouble and needs her spare key back. He gives you the [[lighthouse key]]. You can get your two [[plank]]s here, which respawn on the north-east end of the Barbarian Outpost along the fence.\n[[File:Horror from the Deep bridge.png|thumb|Repairing the bridge.|220px]]\nUse both planks on the broken bridge some distance to the east of Larrissa (you will cross another bridge to get there). For ''each'' side of the broken bridge (east and west) you will need to use a plank (only regular planks work) and 30 [[steel nails]] with a hammer in your inventory. Note that you can cross the bridge before fixing it by jumping over the gap. Depending on the player's agility, they may take slight damage from the leap. After the bridge has been repaired (despite it not looking any different) the walkway can be used to cross it without failure. Check your quest log to make sure it says that you've fixed the bridge.\n\n===Voices in the night===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[tinderbox]], [[molten glass]], [[swamp tar]].''\n\nReturn to Larrissa. She asks you to go inside the lighthouse and find out what happened to [[Jossik]]. Enter the building; you will appear in an [[instance]] with Larrissa inside. The furniture is smashed and there are blood splatters and claw marks on the floor and walls. She asks you to repair the light mechanism to prevent any shipwrecks. She does not know how to, but says Jossik probably had some manuals lying around. Go up one floor. You may wish to search the [[bookcase (Lighthouse)|bookcase]] and take all the books to find out what is going on.\n\nThe [[Journal (Horror from the Deep)|journal of Jossik]] chronicles how he became lighthouse keeper when his uncle [[Silas]] mysteriously disappeared and that he began hearing strange voices. It also mentions the local Fremennik's superstition that there are sea monsters beneath the lighthouse and the strange metal door his uncle had installed in the basement. After meeting Larrissa, Jossik found Silas's 'bizarre' diary and put it in the bookcase as well. The voices and sounds he had heard became more disturbing over time and he eventually decided to give Larrissa a spare key. The diary ends with Jossik's decision to investigate strange noises from the basement. The [[Diary (Horror from the Deep)|uncle's diary]] reveals some passages about creatures called [[dagannoth]] and joining them and the ocean. In particular, it mentions the metal door several times as being 'the key'. In between the incoherent ramblings, it says that the key to the door is given by colours: white, blue, brown and red are the elemental [[runes]]. Similarly, yellow and green are weapons: the sword of the warrior and the arrow of the huntsman, respectively. The door is meant to bind the dagannoth to the lighthouse and Silas ends with the suggestion that either of them can become the other.\n\n[[File:Horror from the Deep - The Lighthouse.png|right|thumb|220px|Lighting the Lightomatic Deluxe 500.]]\nThe [[manual|lighthouse manual]] describes how to maintain the [[Lightomatic]] Deluxe 500. There is a troubleshooting FAQ section at the end of the book. If there is no light, you should use a tinderbox to light the Light Source Module producing the flame. If that does not work, the fuel may be the problem, in which case the book recommends official Lightomatic Non Renewing Light Source Fuel, though [[swamp tar]] can work. If the light is on but barely visible, you may need to remove the dark shipping wrapping from the Light Amplyfying Lens System (LALS) or use the official LALS Maintenance Pack to fix any cracks, though some [[molten glass]] will also work.\n\nGo up to the top floor and use some [[molten glass]] and some [[swamp tar]] in either order on the lighting mechanism in order to fix it. Then, light the tar with a [[tinderbox]]. The Lightomatic will be fixed. Return to Larrissa, who requests that you do everything to find Jossik.\n\n===The door is the key===\n'''''Items required:''' One of each elemental [[runes|rune]], 1 [[arrow]], 1 [[sword]].''\n[[File:Horror from the Deep - The strange door.png|thumb|220px|The strange door.]]\nGo down the iron ladder into the basement to find the door mentioned in Jossik's journal. You appear in a kind of sea cavern, with further passage blocked by the [[strange wall (Lighthouse)|metal door]]. It has a monstrous face in its centre surrounded by six icons: the four runes, a sword and an arrow.\n\nUse all of your basic elemental [[runes]] on the door ([[Fire rune|fire]], [[Water rune|water]], [[Earth rune|earth]], and [[Air rune|air]]). If you have many runes of a type the door will only use one rune, not the entire stack. Similarly, add your [[sword]] (any type, but you will not get it back) and [[arrow]] (any type except [[ogre arrows|ogre]] and [[training arrows|training]], but you will not get it back). Bolts will not work. This unlocks the door.\n\nA fight is imminent; if you need to bank, use your [[games necklace]]/[[Grouping]] teleport to go back to [[Barbarian Assault]], or use the fairy ring back to [[Zanaris]] to bank. Get good [[armour]] ([[Rune armour|rune]] or better for melee) or [[magic armour]] ([[Mystic robes]] or better); bring many [[Mind rune|mind]], [[Chaos rune|chaos]], [[Death rune|death]], or [[blood runes]] and enough runes to cast several of each elemental [[spell]] (wind, water, earth, and fire); get a good [[weapon]] for [[melee]] and some [[ranged equipment]].\n\n===Horrors from the deep===\n'''''Items required:''' Combat equipment.''\n\nGo through the eastern part of the door and down the ladder. You are in a spacious cavern with [[Jossik]], injured, sitting by the ladder. Talk to him and be prepared to fight a [[dagannoth]].\n[[File:Horror from the Deep first dagannoth.png|thumb|Safespotting the first dagannoth.|220px]]\nJossik says his leg is broken and 'those creatures' can come back any moment. He explains he was attacked by mysterious monsters whilst investigating what had happened to his uncle Silas, when suddenly he was attacked by very strong monsters who trapped him there. You suggest going back to inform Larrissa that he is safe, at which point a level 100 dagannoth emerges from the sea and attacks!\n\nThe [[Dagannoth (Horror from the Deep)|dagannoth]] only attacks with melee, so [[Protect from Melee]] is recommended, otherwise it is possible to [[safespot]] from behind the rocks in the room, alternatively, you can initiate the chat sequence with Jossik while standing in front of the stalagmite on his left (DO NOT MOVE) the Dagannoth will not attack. It can be killed by all forms of [[combat]].\n\nAfter defeating it, Jossik says that was not the creature that had attacked him but one of its offspring. A cutscene follows in which a larger dagannoth appears from the waters, revealing itself to be the much stronger [[dagannoth mother]]. She attacks with both Ranged and melee, periodically changes colour in cyclical fashion every 18 seconds. You have to attack her with the correct style depending on her colour in order to deal any damage.\n\nIt may be possible to safespot the Dagannoth mother by going to the south-east corner of the room; this will stop her colours from changing, allowing players to kill her using only a single type of elemental spell, such as [[Wind Blast]].\n\n[[File:Horror from the Deep - Dagannoth mother safespot.png|thumb|300px|A safespot for fighting the dagannoth mother. Protect from Missiles should be active at all times during the fight.]]\n\n:{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Image\n!Colour\n!Weakness\n!Attack Using\n|-\n|[[File:Dagannoth mother white.png|40px]]\n|White\n|[[Air spells]]\n|[[Wind Strike]], [[Wind Bolt|Bolt]], [[Wind Blast|Blast]], [[Wind Wave|Wave]], or [[Wind Surge|Surge]].\n|-\n|[[File:Dagannoth mother blue.png|40px]]\n|Blue\n|[[Water spells]]\n|[[Water Strike]], [[Water Bolt|Bolt]], [[Water Blast|Blast]], [[Water Wave|Wave]], or [[Water Surge|Surge]].\n|-\n|[[File:Dagannoth mother orange.png|40px]]\n|Orange\n|Melee\n|[[Melee]] attacks.\n|-\n|[[File:Dagannoth mother brown.png|40px]]\n|Brown\n|[[Earth spells]]\n|[[Earth Strike]], [[Earth Bolt|Bolt]], [[Earth Blast|Blast]], [[Earth Wave|Wave]], or [[Earth Surge|Surge]].\n|-\n|[[File:Dagannoth mother red.png|40px]]\n|Red\n|[[Fire spells]]\n|[[Fire Strike]], [[Fire Bolt|Bolt]], [[Fire Blast|Blast]], [[Fire Wave|Wave]], or [[Fire Surge|Surge]].\n|-\n|[[File:Dagannoth mother green.png|40px]]\n|Green\n|Ranged\n|[[Ranged]] attacks.\n|}\n\nIf you cannot see the colour changes clearly, look at the chat box. Using the wrong attack does no damage to it. She detects [[Prayer]]s and will automatically use the opposite attack type. By default, she will use ranged at a distance and melee up close. Her melee attacks are stronger.\n\nShe has higher defensive melee stats, so it is easier to ignore her melee form and either only use [[Magic]], or switch between that and [[Ranged]]. Any type of [[air staff]] can help switch between the correct spell types.\n\nThe stalagmites in the room can be used to safespot. Wait for the desired colour while taking no damage, attack from a distance with [[Protect from Missiles]] active, or [[flinch]] with a melee weapon. Alternatively, climb the ladder until she changes to the right colour. \n\n'''Note:''' If there are any dropped items at the time of the dagannoth mother's death, you will not be able to get them back. You are still able to loot your items if you died within the boss room, but only before the dagannoth mother is killed. \n\nYou'll get a [[rusty casket]] after you defeat the dagannoth mother and automatically finish the quest. If your inventory is full when killing the [[dagannoth mother]], you will not receive the casket. Instead, go and talk to Jossik upstairs, who will say he picked up the casket after you left it on the ground.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\nWhen closing the reward scroll interface, you tell Jossik to get out of the cave. He agrees you must go quickly for the mother's children are coming. He also tells you to follow him upstairs to open the familiar-looking casket.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Horror from the Deep\n|image = [[File:Horror from the Deep reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Magic|4,662.5}} [[Magic]] experience\n*{{SCP|Strength|4,662.5}} [[Strength]] experience\n*{{SCP|Ranged|4,662.5}} [[Ranged]] experience\n*A [[damaged book]] of your choice which, when complete, will become: a [[Holy book]] ([[Saradomin]]), an [[Unholy book]] ([[Zamorak]]), or a [[Book of balance]] ([[Guthix]]).\n**Further damaged [[God book|books]] can be purchased from Jossik for 5,000 coins each, even if you have not filled your other book(s).\n*Access to the [[Lighthouse]] [[general store]] and the [[Dagannoth]] caves underneath.\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Dagannoth mother]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Horror from the Deep is required for the following:\n*[[Recipe for Disaster]] - [[Recipe for Disaster/Defeating the Culinaromancer|Defeating the Culinaromancer]]\n*[[Rag and Bone Man II]] ([[The Fremennik Trials]] can be completed as an alternative prerequisite)\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*While in instanced versions of the lighthouse, you no longer see the fairy ring outside which was added later.\n*The location, characters, books, diaries, monsters, are paying an obvious tribute to the works of Howard Philips Lovecraft.\n*Despite being somewhat repaired during the quest, the broken bridge's examine will still refer to jumping off it rather than crossing it on the walkway.\n\n{{Horror from the Deep}}"

To get back in, enter the rocks on the east side of the Wanderer's tent.\n\n'''''Note:'''''  ''For the pit jump: 20% run energy is required and it will be drained. Higher agility increases the chances of success.''\n\n==Walkthrough==\n{{Map|3315,2849|r=4|mtype=square|width=250|height=250|align=right|caption=The quest's start point.}}\nCollect all the supplies needed for the quest including your [[cat]]. Use the [[Nardah teleport]] if you have one or use a [[magic carpet]] ride to [[Pollnivneach]], then south to Nardah  (or [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|DLQ}}) and head to the [[Wanderer]] (north of [[Sophanem]]) in the desert. If you brought an empty bucket to get a pile of salt, go to the pond west of the Wanderer, prior to talking to her. Use the collect water option to get a bucket of salt water. The Wanderer will have a strange reaction to your cat. Ask her why she has a problem with the cat. She will tell you that if you get your cat away from her, she would tell you about the secret entrance to [[Sophanem]]. Wait, and you will automatically pick up your cat. She will then ask for a [[tinderbox]] and full [[waterskin]]. Talk to her again and say '''Yes, I have them all here''' (4th dialogue option). Once you give them to her, she will hypnotise you and you'll enter a small cave just north-east of her tent. You can now use this passage to enter the city at any time, including if you die, which will give you the quest items back.\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - The Pyramid Door.png|thumb|The pyramid door.]]\nYou will end up outside a [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]] in Sophanem, and a [[canopic jar]] will appear in your inventory. Touch the northern door of the Southern pyramid. (There is a picture of a cat on the door) ('''Note: If you take too long, a spectre will attack you and steal some of your gold or deal damage.''') Touching the door will trigger the first flashback.\n\n===Flashback===\n'''{{Colour|Red|Warning}}:''' Once you begin a flashback, you will be unable to teleport away until you either finish it or die. Dying will cause your cat  to be lost. You will have to walk to the entrance if you need to leave. Make sure you are prepared. If you are low on food, you can log out. When logging back in you will end up outside of the pyramid entrance.\n\nEvery now and again during the quest, you'll experience a flashback where you remember what you did while you were hypnotised. You need to play through these in order to progress through the quest.\n\n'''Important note: Using the mini-map to navigate the pyramid will automatically avoid the traps (both the wall-crushers and pit traps) and is much more time efficient than manually navigating it.'''\n\nTouch the door of the [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]] to begin the first flashback. During the flashback, you will need to go through the pyramid. You'll see some wall crushers. Stand on the opposite wall and don't go next to them, as they will damage you if you do. Once you're past the crusher blocks, you'll find pit traps in the next hallway. If you step on the wrong spot, you'll fall into a pit and end up at the beginning of the pyramid. You can move forward by clicking on the map, and your character will avoid the traps automatically. To avoid traps, stay along the left wall until you pass the whitish rectangle on the wall, and then go to the right side. Continue walking until you are opposite a square. Go back to the left side until you pass a candle. Switch to the right wall once more.\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - The Pit.png|thumb|The pit.]]\nYou'll see [[mummies]] (level 84). They will attack you; simply go past them. You'll also see [[Scarab swarm|Scarab swarms]] (level 96) crack out of the ground. They can rapidly hit you for 2 damage and can also inflict a [[poison]] condition which hits you for another 2 points of damage, and they very obnoxiously stop you in your tracks, regardless of whether or not you have auto-retaliate enabled. Continue to some more wall crushers. Past these—you'll eventually find a large pit. Jump over it. (You'll need 20% run energy. If you fail, you'll reappear near the second set of wall crushers.)\n\nGo to the west door (double-check your compass) and try to open it. Now, you need to solve a puzzle. The objective is to flip all of the tiles onto their gold sides. There is no required number of flips that you must make, nor is there any limit of tries. Each time you flip a tile, the nine tiles in a 3x3 grid will also flip. To solve this puzzle click on the squares in the order shown on the image below (make sure the puzzle is in the default position as shown below. To get to the default position, right click on the gold solution to reset. Keep hitting the \"reset puzzle\" button until the puzzle looks as shown in the picture below).\nOnce you've solved it, you'll wake up fully healed outside the pyramid.\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - Puzzle.png|left|thumb|The puzzle.]]\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - Puzzle solution.png|thumb|Solution]]\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n===After Flashback 1===\nAfter you finish the flashback, talk to the [[Sphinx]] with your [[cat]] out. Ask for help and the Sphinx will ask you this question: \"A husband and a wife have six sons and each son has one sister. How many people are in the family?\" The answer is 9 (6 brothers + 1 sister + 2 parents = 9; while a naive reading might assume that each brother has a separate sister, since every member of the family is related, if that was true each brother would have six sisters, not one sister). '''If you guess wrong, you will lose your cat!''' Once answered correctly, you will receive the [[Sphinx's token]], so you can speak to the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]].\n\nGo to the High Priest, located in the south-west corner of the city, and ask him about the remains. He will tell you to put them back in the burial chamber.\n\nReturn to the [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]], and select open door. Your cat will help you get back inside. Go through the pyramid using the same steps as in the first flashback. ''Before you jump the pit examine the canopic jar in your inventory''! so you know which one to choose later. When you jump across the pit, you'll enter the second flashback.\n\n===Flashback 2===\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - Attacking the Guardian.png|thumb|Attacking the guardian.]]\nThe second flashback begins where the first one left off—on the other side of the pit. Open the unlocked door of the west room. Examine the four jars to find which one you used to have in your inventory. If you don't remember, you can open your quest journal to figure out which jar you need to pick up, which will be stated by the major organ inside of it, or just try them all. The player will only take the correct one. As soon as you try to pick up your jar, a guardian will attack you. It can be anywhere from level 75 to level 81. It attacks with [[Magic]] and [[Melee]]. Use a [[Protection prayers|Protection]] prayer or take off your [[armour]] to kill it with melee. \n\nDying during this fight will send you to your [[respawn]] location with the canopic jar in your inventory. Any other items are subject to normal death rules, while [[Ultimate Ironmen]] will have a death pile next to the pyramid entrance in Sophanem. Your cat will be gone. Re-entering the pyramid will return you outside of the west room in the flashback state.\n\n'''Once you've defeated the guardian, pick up the jar.''' Leave the room and jump across the pit again. The flashback ends. (If you forgot to pick up the jar before jumping the pit, leave the pyramid and enter it again to return to just outside the jar room.)\n\n===Returning the canopic jar===\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - Puzzle solution.png|thumb|Solve the puzzle by pressing the squares in the order indicated by the numbers]]\n{{Listen|filename=Icthlarin's Little Helper jingle.ogg|desc=The jingle that plays upon solving the puzzle.|title=Solved!}}\nAfter the flashback is over, you will feel regret and you will say to yourself that you think you should put the jar back. Jump the pit and go to the west door. You will need to solve the same door puzzle to enter the room. Click on the large golden bird to reset the puzzle until it lands on the solution shown in the image to the right. Then click the tiles indicated on the picture. Once you turn all of the tiles to their gold side; you will automatically enter the room. Drop the [[canopic jar]] where you found it and go back through the [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]], across the pit, past the monsters, and past the traps to the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]]. Alternatively, you can log out and back in, which will return you to the entrance with the objective still completed.\n\n'''Note:''' Jumping with an item in hand is not guaranteed to cause you to fall with higher agility levels.\n\n===The High Priest===\nTalk with the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]]. He will ask you to prepare a ceremony. You will need to help the [[Embalmer]] and the [[Carpenter]]. If you used a Protection prayer during the fight, recharge your prayer points at the altar here.\n\n===The carpenter===\nThen, head to the city's eastern side to find the [[Carpenter]], who can be found near the Pottery Wheel. He needs a [[willow log]] to make a [[Holy symbol (Icthlarin's Little Helper)|holy symbol]]. Talk to him again to give him your willow log. After the quest, the Carpenter will buy willow logs from you at 40 [[coins]] each in groups of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 (he stops doing this after the completion of [[Contact!]]). After a short wait, the carpenter will give you the symbol.\n\n'''Note:''' You can skip the \"short wait\" by turning in the bucket of sap, linen, and bag of salt to the Embalmer and then going back to the Carpenter to collect the holy symbol immediately.\n\n===The embalmer===\nTalk to the [[Embalmer]] in the building south of the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]], near the water symbol. He will ask for a [[bucket of sap]], [[linen]], and a [[bag of salt]]. Tell him you will get the items later. To get a pile of salt, use the [[bucket of saltwater]] on the [[suntrap]] east of the embalmer. A buckets of sap can be obtained by using a [[knife]] with an [[evergreen tree]] or a pointy regular wood tree with the description \"A commonly found tree\" while you have a bucket. If you didn't bring sap, you can get some from the latter kind around Lumbridge or the Grand Exchange. The [[linen]] can be bought from [[Raetul]] for 30 coins. He is located in the north-east part of [[Sophanem]], near the silk stall. '''Note:''' You will not be able to buy the Linen from him before you have spoken to the embalmer, as your player character will decline his offer.\n\n===Starting the ceremony===\nThe Carpenter or the Embalmer (whoever you helped last) will tell you that the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]] began the ceremony without you. To find him, go back into the [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]] past the traps and the pit. As you cross the pit, the third flashback will begin.\n\n===Flashback 3===\nYou will now have an [[Unholy symbol (Icthlarin's Little Helper)|unholy symbol]] in your inventory. Your character tells you that your mistress wants it inside the [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]] so she can teleport there. Enter the east room and use the symbol with any sarcophagus around the walls, flashback will end once done; if not, leave the room.\n\n===The ceremony===\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - The ceremony.png|thumb|The ceremony started and the player was too late.]]\nYou will speak to yourself again showing your regret for causing harm to the town. Jump across the pit again and re-enter the eastern burial chamber. After a cutscene, you'll learn that the [[Wanderer]] was behind it. She is really the Devourer, an evil goddess, and she'll possess one of the priests.\n\nYou will fight a level 91 [[Possessed Priest]]. You can use [[Protect from Magic]] and kill him. Once you have dealt with him he drops a four-dose [[Attack potion|attack]], [[Strength potion|strength]], [[Magic potion|magic]], [[Agility potion|agility]], or [[defence potion]] (Ironmen may wish to keep the agility potion if they plan on doing Tai Bwo Wannai Trio, should they receive it). Talk to the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]] again and he will tell you to meet them back above.\n\n'''Note:''' If you take too long to defeat him, the message \"''The priest seems to have recovered from the Devourers spell''\" will appear, and you will have to exit the door and re-enter to face him again with full [[Hitpoints]].\n\n===Flashback 4===\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - Meeting Icthlarin.png|thumb|Icthlarin, god of the dead stops the player from stealing.]]\nAfter talking to the High Priest, leave the room, you will see the final flashback as a cut-scene. You will be escaping from the [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]], and [[Icthlarin]], god of the dead, will dehypnotise you.\n\n===Finishing the quest===\nYou will find yourself outside the pyramid. Talk to the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]] to complete the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Icthlarin's Little Helper|image=|qp=2|rewards=*{{SCP|Thieving|4,500}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{SCP|Agility|4,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*{{SCP|Woodcutting|4,000}} [[Woodcutting]] experience\n*[[Catspeak amulet]]\n*Access to the city of [[Sophanem]]\n*Unlock the carpet rides from [[Pollnivneach]] to [[Sophanem]] and [[Menaphos]]}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Icthlarin's Little Helper is required for the following:\n*[[A Tail of Two Cats]]\n*[[Contact!]]\n*[[Ratcatchers]]\n*[[Falador Diary#Medium|Falador Medium Diary]] \n*[[Desert Diary#Easy|Desert Easy]] & [[Desert Diary#Elite|Elite Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 27 April 2022\n|update = Beneath Cursed Sands\n|change = \n*Fixed a few plotholes and inconsistencies in the Icthlarin's Little Helper and Contact! quests.\n*Removed some inappropriate dialogue from the Prince Ali Rescue, Icthlarin's Little Helper and Contact! quests.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 6 October 2016\n|update = The Hill Giant Boss\n|poll = \n|change = Talking to various NPCs in Tale of Two Cats/Icthlarin's Little Helper quests while other pets are visible displays the correct dialogue.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 7 April 2016\n|update = Hell-Rats, Fairy Rings & Perks\n|poll = \n|change = Several typos have been fixed in the Icthlarin's Little Helper quest.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n{{Icthlarin's Little Helper}}\n{{Sophanem}}"

Climb the stairs, and go up to the {{FloorNumber|uk=2}}. Talk to [[Wizard Mizgog]] and ask him questions to find out that he needs your help. He will tell you that [[Wizard Grayzag]]'s [[imp]]s have stolen his beads and he wants you to get them back for him. He needs you to collect:\n*A [[black bead]] - {{Coins|{{GEP|Black bead}}}}\n*A [[yellow bead]] - {{Coins|{{GEP|Yellow bead}}}}\n*A [[red bead]] - {{Coins|{{GEP|Red bead}}}}\n*A [[white bead]] - {{Coins|{{GEP|White bead}}}}\n\n===Obtaining beads===\nTo obtain the beads, you may buy them from the [[Grand Exchange]] for a total of {{Coins|{{GEP|Red bead|1}} + {{GEP|Black bead|1}} + {{GEP|Yellow bead|1}} + {{GEP|White bead|1}}}}, receive them in a trade with another player, or you can simply kill imps instead - each bead has a 5/128 chance of dropping. Imps can be found throughout [[Gielinor]]. There are several good spots to kill imps including: east of the [[Ardougne Monastery]], on top of the [[Karamja Volcano]] (be aware of level 14 [[scorpion]]s in this area), next to the [[Charcoal burner|Charcoal Burner]], or by the southern entrance to [[Falador]]. Imps may teleport away when in combat making them harder to kill, beads are also an uncommon drop, thus many players will often trade for beads instead to avoid the hassle of finding the beads themselves. If you choose to kill them yourself or are an [[Ironman mode|ironman]], it may be an advantage to use ranged/magic attacks to reduce the running around when the imps teleport.\n\nOnce you have all four beads, return to Wizard Mizgog and give them to him to finish the quest.  He won't accept them one at a time, so ultimate ironmen should plan to get the whole thing done at once. \n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Imp Catcher\n|image = [[File:Imp Catcher reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*{{SCP|Magic|875}} [[Magic]] experience\n*The [[amulet of accuracy]]\n*After the quest players can obtain more amulets by speaking to Wizard Mizgog with a complete set of beads.\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n\n==Trivia==\n*If you examine the Mizgog's table before giving him the beads, the examine text will read \"A table bearing a curious device\".

Keep at least 6 inventory spaces semi-free. If you have completed [[Shades of Mort'ton]] you can get the hammer and planks from the [[Mort'ton]] [[Razmire Builders Merchants|builder shop]].}}\n\n[[Burgh de Rott]] does not have a functional bank at the beginning of this quest; Canifis is the closest available bank. You will repair Burgh de Rott's bank, general store, and bar throughout the course of the quest.\n\nBefore you travel, you should make sure that you have what you need to complete the next part of the quest.\n\nYou will be attacked by aggressive shades when in Mort'ton if you are under level 81 combat.\n\n5 buckets are optimal in order to minimise the number of trips to and from the pub's basement, but you can use one bucket if inventory space is a priority. Buckets spawn just west of the well in Burgh de Rott.\n\nYou have several options of travelling from Canifis to Burgh de Rott. You could teleport to the ''[[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton]]'' minigame if you have completed ''Shades of Mort'ton''. You could use the boat shortcut you first used in the previous quest. You can teleport to fairy ring {{fairycode|BKR}} to be closer to this boat.  If you have at least 50 [[Agility]], you could use the fairy ring {{fairycode|BIP}}, which bypasses the swamp and avoids nearly all of the ghasts. Alternatively, you could run through the swamp again. You can also use a [[Mort'ton teleport]] scroll, [[Barrows teleport (tablet)|Barrows teleport]] tablet, or cast the [[Barrows Teleport]] spell (keep in mind you will need the normal spell book). \n\nTo return to Canifis from Burgh de Rott, you could use the fairy ring {{fairycode|cks}}, a slayer ring, the [[Kharyrll Teleport]] or [[Salve Graveyard Teleport]] (remember to switch back to the [[standard spellbook]] afterward), an [[ectophial]], or the boat shortcut.\n\n===Arrival at Burgh de Rott===\n[[File:Florin chathead.png|left]]\nWhen you arrive in Mort'ton (the town north of Burgh de Rott), head south to find angry residents at the gate. Before being able to enter, talk to [[Florin]] from the outside of the gate and then use your food item on the [[open chest (In Aid of the Myreque)|open chest]] directly in front of the gate. Florin will then let you into the town. Shades will no longer attack you.\n[[File:In Aid of the Myreque - clearing basement entrance.png|thumb|270px|Clearing the rubble from the basement entrance.]]\n\nOnce inside, talk to Florin again regarding 'out of the way' places to learn the cellar of the inn might be suitable but it is covered in rubble.\n\n===Clearing out the rubble from the bar basement===\nGo to the pub just south-east of the gate, climb over the [[broken wall (Burgh de Rott)|broken wall]], and mine the [[Rubble (In Aid of the Myreque)|rubble]] by using your pickaxe on it. If you forgot to bring a bucket, there is a bucket spawn near the well south of the front gate. You can [[world hop]] to pick up additional buckets quickly, 5 buckets will make this faster. When you have at least one bucket, climb down the [[trapdoor (Burgh de Rott)|trapdoor]].\n\nIn the basement of the pub mine each pile of rubble, and then use a spade on the remaining debris to fill [[bucket of rubble|buckets of rubble]]. Each bucket can contain 3 loads worth of rubble.\n[[File:In Aid of the Myreque - clearing rubble.png|thumb|270px|left|Mining rubble from the basement.]]\n\nEvery few rubble piles you mine, you will get 8 items: [[nail]]s (10 [[bronze nails|bronze]], 5 [[iron nails|iron]], 3 [[steel nails|steel]], 2 [[black nails|black]], 1 [[mithril nails|mithril]]), 1 [[rock (limestone)|rock]], 1 [[broken glass]], [[Dusty scroll (In Aid of the Myreque)|dusty scroll]], and [[plaster fragment]]. If you do not have space, they will drop to the floor, while the dusty scroll and plaster fragment will be discarded into the buckets of rubble. You can read the scroll and fragment, but they are not needed to complete this quest. The rest of the items are not required for the quest, unless you do not have the required nails.\n\nBuckets of rubble are tradable but not on the Grand Exchange. Players often pay 25k-50k for each bucket.\n\nWhen the buckets are filled, climb the ladder and use them on the [[Rubble Pile|rubble pile]] just south-west outside the bar to empty them. The dusty scroll and plaster fragment can be reobtained by searching the rubble pile. Trying to use the buckets' \"Empty\" option will simply give you a message that you cannot dump it anywhere. \n\nIf you drop items to make room for the junk, they will disappear if you exit the basement. If you only mine the rocks to rubble and exit the area, the rubble will be restored to rocks and you will have to mine them again.\n\nAfter you are finished mining all of the rubble, there will be a cutscene of you noticing a [[plaque (Burgh de Rott)|plaque]] on the wall. The plaque holds no significance for this quest. If the cutscene doesnt play, you need to return to the cellar and clear more rubble that magically appears.\n\nGo and talk to [[Razvan]] (who is typically located just north of the bar), and he will tell you to patch up the town a bit.\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n===Repairing the general store===\n[[File:In Aid of the Myreque - repairing general store.png|thumb|270px|Repairing Aurel's general store.]]\n[[File:Aurel chathead.png|left]]\nTalk to [[Aurel]] in the general store in the north-eastern part of the city, and he will tell you that you need to repair the roof and the walls of the shop. Head up the ladder on the outside of the southern wall of the General Store and use 3 planks and 12 nails in the hole in the roof to repair it. After that, head down and use 3 planks and 12 nails on the damaged wall just east of the ladder.\n\nThen, talk to [[Aurel]] again - he will want the store stocked before he can open it. You will be given a [[Crate (In Aid of the Myreque)|crate]] to fill up with these items. ('''Tip:''' You can change the second requirement in the request by walking away ''during'' the dialogue where Aurel tells you what he needs, but ''before'' he hands you the crate. Receiving the crate finalizes the requirements and cannot be changed afterward.)\n\nHe requires the following:\n\n{{Checklist|\n*10 [[bronze axe]]s\n*10 [[raw mackerel]] '''or''' 10 raw [[Snail meat]]s (depending on what is asked). The cooked foods may also be provided (tested for [[mackerel]] only).\n*3 [[tinderbox]]es\n}}\n\nYou will now need to visit a bank. Fill the crate with the items required.\n\nWhile you are at the bank pick up these items for the next part of the quest:\n\n{{Checklist|\n*5 planks,\n*a hammer\n*[[swamp paste]]\n*20 [[nail]]s\n}}\n\nThe snail meat can be acquired by killing snails throughout the [[Mort Myre Swamp]], or purchased on the Grand Exchange. Any type works. If you brought a [[big fishing net]], there are some big net spots south of the Burgh de Rott bank that can be used to obtain the mackerel.\n\nDeposit your crate to [[Aurel]] in Burgh de Rott. Talk to him again, and he will ask that you repair the bank to the south of the city.\n\n===Repairing the bank===\n{{Needed|A [[hammer]], 5 [[plank]]s,  [[swamp paste]], 20 [[nail]]s.}}[[File:In Aid of the Myreque - fixing bank booth.png|thumb|220px|Repairing Burgh de Rott's bank booth.]]\n[[File:Cornelius chathead.png|left]]\nRepair the bank booth by inspecting the bank booth, and then the wall on the west side of the bank as you did before. \n\nThen, ask [[Cornelius]] what to do, and in the same conversation, ask him: ''Do you fancy the job?''.\n\nYou will now be able to use the bank.\n\n===Repairing the furnace===\n{{Needed|a [[hammer]], 2 [[steel bar]]s, 1 piece of [[coal]], 1 [[tinderbox]], [[Efaritay's aid]] or a [[silver]] weapon such as the [[Silver sickle (b)]], and some food for lower-levelled players.}}\n[[File:In Aid of the Myreque - repairing furnace.png|thumb|Repairing Burgh de Rott's furnace.]]\nTalk to [[Cornelius]] again, he will ask that you fix the [[furnace (Burgh de Rott)|furnace]]. It can be found in the south-east corner of Burgh de Rott. Take two [[steel bar]]s, a [[tinderbox]], a [[hammer]] and one [[coal]] and repair the furnace to the south-east side of the city. Bring your [[silver]] weapon or [[Efaritay's aid]] along with you. Inspect the broken furnace to repair it. Put the coal inside of the newly fixed furnace, and light it with the tinderbox. You will then see a cutscene.\n\n[[File:In Aid of the Myreque cutscene.png|thumb|220px|Vanstrom notices the furnace has been lit!]]\n[[File:Gadderanks chathead.png|left]]\nAfter the cutscene, you will need to prepare for a fight with your [[silver]] weapon '''or''' any weapon wearing [[Efaritay's aid]]. Go to the general store, and talk to [[Gadderanks]] and then [[Wiskit]]. Talk to one of the [[Vampyre Juvinate]]s and Gadderanks will try to kill you.\n\nKill Gadderanks (he's level 35 and the fight is fairly easy), and then kill the Vampyre juvinates (level 50 and 54) with your silver weapon or any weapon with Efaritay's aid. During the fight, Veliaf will come and assist you by taking on one of the vampyres. (These enemies can all be safespotted from behind the store counter with a ranged weapon as long as [[Efaritay's aid]] is on) There is a bug where sometimes, one of the juvinates will not turn into mist and will instead become invincible. If this happens, leave the general store and try again. Switching to a non silver weapon for a few hits may also work.\n\nTalk to Gadderanks again, and he will tell you of the vampyre's weaknesses and then die. You will get his [[Gadderhammer|hammer]], which is similar to a [[Granite maul]] but stronger against [[Shade (disambiguation)|shade]]s. (If your inventory has no room for the hammer, you can speak to [[Aurel]] to receive it later.)\n\nTalk to [[Veliaf]], and he will tell you to meet him back at his [[Myreque Hideout|hideout]] in the [[Hollows]].\n\n===Transporting Ivan===\n{{Needed|[[Armour]], [[food]], 10 coins if taking the swamp boat back to Canifis, and a [[weapon]] to kill the [[vampyre]]s. The [[Silver sickle (b)|blessed silver sickle]] has no attack stats, so it is recommended to use the [[Wolfbane]] dagger from [[Priest in Peril]], [[Blessed axe]] from [[Animal Magnetism]] or a [[demonbane weapon]] such as Silverlight or Darklight. Players may also choose to use an [[Efaritay's aid]] to damage the vampyres with any weapon.}}\n\n''It is '''strongly recommended''' to bring a [[steel chainbody]], [[steel platelegs]], [[steel med helm]], and a [[silver sickle]] in order to arm Ivan for the fight, other gear will not work. Ivan will also accept up to 15 cooked [[snail]]s, cooked [[salmon]], cooked [[Cooked slimy eel|slimy eel]] or [[stew]].'' ''You will not get back any items you give to Ivan.''\n\n''It is also recommended to bring runes for one attack spell (if using melee) in order to lure the first vampyre to you.''\n\n''Remember to bank any pets before beginning this part of the journey, as Ivan will stop you from taking any followers with you.''\n[[File:In Aid of the Myreque juvinates.png|thumb|220px|The player and Ivan are ambushed by juvinates.]]\n\nReturn to [[Veliaf]] in the Myreque Hideout and talk to him. He will ask you talk to [[Radigad]] and [[Polmafi]] to have them head to the [[Burgh de Rott]] hideout, but wants you to escort [[Ivan Strom]] to the [[Paterdomus Temple]] because the mission is becoming too dangerous for the young, aspiring priest.\n\n{{Instance}}\n\nTalk to Radigad Ponfit and Polmafi Ferdygris. If you brought items for Ivan, right-click and \"use\" the items on him. Speak to Ivan when you're ready to escort him through the swamp.\n\nYou get to choose between two routes through [[Mort Myre Swamp]]. You will be attacked on both the 'long' and the 'short' routes. If you choose the long route, you have to fight four level 50 [[Vampyre Juvinate]]s. If you choose the short route, you'll be attacked by two that are level 75. The 'short' route is probably easier than the 'long' route because it's easier to defend Ivan, despite the fact that you have a harder fight. If you can, try and get Ivan behind you so he can't be attacked by the juvinates.  If you chose the 'short' route, you can sometimes intercept the vampyre that is meant to attack Ivan.  This can buy you significant time.  Simply attack the vampyre that beelines to Ivan when the instance starts to occupy him.\n\nWhen you first enter the fight area, don't move. If you chose to bring runes, cast any attack spell on the first vampyre and kill it. Remember to use your [[Silver weaponry|silver weapon]] OR equip [[Efaritay's aid]] to fight the vampyres! Efaritay's aid caps damage at 10, so a fast hitting weapon such as [[Dart|Darts]] are ideal.\n\nThe second vampyre will always attack Ivan at the same point, so just hope that Ivan survives until you finish off the first one. It is possible to finish this part without giving Ivan anything, but it is difficult, and it will often require several attempts just to keep Ivan alive. Therefore, it is highly recommended to give Ivan armour and food. It should also be noted that Ivan '''does not''' receive protection from the player's [[Protect from Melee]] prayer. If Ivan becomes trapped by the vampyres, you can talk to him then move your character in order to have Ivan follow you one square allowing you to block the vampyre from attacking Ivan.\n\nIf Ivan's health becomes too low (or after he runs out of food), he will teleport out. At this point, you might as well leave the area because killing the remaining vampyres will not let you progress. When you leave, you will reappear somewhere around [[Canifis]], so make your way back to where you spoke to Ivan to try again (make sure to collect food via the bank on your way back to him as he will need more). Once you defeat the vampyres, you will complete the trek and appear outside the Temple of the Salve.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>There is a bug where it is possible to complete the trek without completing the instance. Just continue the quest as normal.\n\nIf you take the short route with 2 level 75 Vampyre Juvinates, you can keep Ivan safe by walking west once the fight starts into a spot with 3 seaweeds surrounding it, and then keep walking back and forth to the east and west until Ivan decides to go into that spot. Wait for the Vampyre Juvinates to get close to you before attacking. This way, you can protect Ivan without giving him any supplies.\n\nCompleting the long route is possible at a low combat level by supplying Ivan with a full inventory of food and helping him tank the Vampyres.\n\nAfter successfully escorting [[Ivan Strom|Ivan]], talk to [[Drezel]] (inside the temple) at the [[River Salve]], and get the [[Temple library key|key to the library]] from him (using chat option 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3). Mention that the lives of Morytania rest on his decision.\n\nSearch the [[keyhole (Paterdomus)|keyhole]] on the east side of the room [[Drezel]] is in. Use your key on the keyhole. Go down the [[trapdoor (Paterdomus Library)|trapdoor]] into the library, and search the middle [[bookcase (Paterdomus Library)|bookcase]] facing the western wall; you will pick up a book titled inside ''[[The sleeping seven]]''. Read the book.\n\n===The rod of Ivandis===\n{{Needed|[[Hammer]], [[soft clay]], [[mithril bar]], [[silver bar]], 1 [[water rune]] (or [[water staff]]), 1 [[cosmic rune]] (make sure you have the normal spellbook activated for lvl-1 Enchant), a cut [[sapphire]], and a [[rope]].|recommended=[[Ectophial]], [[Amulet of glory]], [[Dramen Staff]], or [[Mort'ton teleport]]''}}\n[[File:Paterdomus library.png|thumb|250px|right|Drezel's library.]]\n[[File:Drezel chathead.png|left]]\n\n[[File:Inaid coffin.png|thumb|220px|The tomb of Ivandis.]]\n\nGo back to [[Canifis]], and enter the trapdoor behind the pub. Search the south wall. Now, directly to your east you should see two wooden boards forming an 'X' which are covering an entrance - use a [[hammer]] on the boards to get through and you should see a tomb that looks like a [[Coffin (Ivandis)|coffin]]. If nothing interesting happens, you must read \"The sleeping seven\".\n\nUse some [[soft clay]] on the top of the tomb to get a [[rod mould]].\n\nGo to a furnace, and use a [[silver bar]], [[mithril bar]], and cut [[sapphire]] to make a [[Silvthrill rod]] and enchant it using [[Lvl-1 Enchant]]. There are several convenient furnaces:\n*Use an [[Amulet of glory]] to access the Edgeville furnace,  return using the fairy ring west of the [[Grand Exchange]] (to fairy ring {{Fairycode|dkr}}) by using {{fairycode|cks}}.\n*Use a [[fairy ring]] to get to the [[Zanaris]] furnace, returning to fairy ring {{Fairycode|cks}}.\n*Minigames Teleport to [[TzHaar Fight Pit]], use the lava forge furnace, and then leave via the fairy ring slightly south (to fairy ring {{Fairycode|cks}}).\n*The one available in [[Port Phasmatys]] after [[Ghosts Ahoy]]; using an [[Ectophial]].\n*The Burgh de Rott furnace you fixed earlier.\n\nTake the enchanted Silvthrill rod and a [[rope]] back to the basement of [[Paterdomus Temple]], use the rod with the well (in the room next to Drezel) with the rope in your inventory to create the [[Rod of ivandis|Rod of ivandis(10)]].\n\nTake the Rod of ivandis to [[Burgh de Rott]], go into the cellar of the pub, and give it to [[Veliaf]] to complete the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=In Aid of the Myreque|image=[[File:In Aid of the Myreque reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=2|rewards=*{{SCP|Attack|2,000}} [[Attack]] experience\n*{{SCP|Strength|2,000}} [[Strength]] experience\n*{{SCP|Crafting|2,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*{{SCP|Defence|2,000}} [[Defence]] experience\n*Access to [[Burgh de Rott]]\n*Access to the [[Temple Trekking]] [[Minigames|minigame]]\n*A [[Gadderhammer]] from defeating [[Gadderanks]]\n*The ability to make the [[Rod of Ivandis]]\n*Completing this quest awards the player with 5 [[Kudos]] which can be claimed by talking to [[Historian Minas]] in the [[Varrock Museum]].}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of In Aid of the Myreque is required for the following:\n*[[Darkness of Hallowvale]]\n*[[Morytania Diary#Hard|Morytania Diary (Medium)]] (partial completion required)\n*[[Morytania Diary#Hard|Morytania Diary (Hard)]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n{{In Aid of the Myreque}}"

Use five pieces of food (must be fish, meat or vegetables), and he will heal to full health. Ask him who he is, and he will say he is here to discover the origins of his religion, and asks that you let him know about anything of interest that you find. Once you say \"I'll keep my eyes open\", the miniquest will begin. \n\nThe player must now gather four [[tattered sun page]]s, [[tattered moon page]]s and [[tattered temple page]]s.

You may also tell Logosia, ''\"I'm going to stop looking for temple, sun and moon pages\"'' to stop receiving them.\n\n==Trivia==\n*After completing the miniquest, as well as having used the [[temple coin]] on the [[Stone Relief]], the player will be able to inform the [[Knight of Varlamore (Kourend Castle)|Knight of Varlamore]] about the [[Forthos Dungeon]]. Once doing so, he will travel to the Altar of the Sun within the dungeon, as he claims the temple may be of help in his mission.\n*The player character's responds to Brother Aimeri saying \"the greater good\" by repeating \"the greater good.\" This is a reference to the 2007 British comedy film ''Hot Fuzz'' in which characters repeat the phrase \"the greater good\" after one another.\n\n{{In Search of Knowledge}}\n{{Miniquests}}"

You can use a [[Fairy rings|fairy ring]] with the code {{Fairycode|cks}} to get there. He tells you about [[the Myreque]], an organisation fighting [[vampyre]]s, which is currently low on weapons and needs an arsenal of steel weapons to survive; Vanstrom doesn't have the time to bring the weapons to his friends he has never actually met yet. If you agree to help Vanstrom, he will also tell you about a boatman in [[Mort'ton]] who is rumoured to be able to show you the Myreque hideout.\n\n:'''Note:''' Make sure that you offer to help (and that your [[Quest journal]] indicates that you have started the quest) or else your trip to Mort'ton will be in vain.\n\n===Mort'ton===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Druid pouch]] (must have 5 charges), [[Silver sickle (b)|blessed silver sickle]] (if refilling the pouch), 6  [[plank|normal plank]]s, a [[hammer]], 225 [[steel nails]], [[combat gear]] (for level 97 [[Skeleton Hellhound]]), 10 [[coins]] or [[ring of charos (a)]], [[steel longsword]], 2 [[steel sword]]s, [[steel mace]], [[steel warhammer]], [[steel dagger]] (all the steel weapons must be held in your [[inventory]] at the same time). You will also need the planks, unless you have completed the Shades of Mort'ton quest and opened the general store.''\n\n'''''Note:''' The end of this quest culminates in a small boss fight against a level 97 [[Skeleton Hellhound]]. Players should be prepared to fight once entering the Myreque Hideout. The beast isn't especially difficult for mid-leveled players, but lower-leveled players should be prepared.''\n\nGo to [[Mort'ton]]. You can walk on foot, but beware that the ghasts on the way will drain charges from your [[Druid pouch]]. Make sure to have plenty of charges because five items are needed in your pouch when you reach your destination. A way around this is to take six [[Mort myre fungus]] so that you can fill the pouch twice once you arrive in Mort'ton. Alternative methods of reaching Mort'ton include the [[Swamp Boaty]] located at [[The Hollows]], reachable on foot or with [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|bkr}} (closer to Canifis), {{Fairycode|bip}} (west of Mort'ton through the winding path; 50 Agility needed), a [[Mort'ton teleport]], the [[Grouping]] teleport to [[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton]], or a [[Barrows teleport]].\n\n===Convincing Cyreg Paddlehorn===\n{{Map|align=right|name=Cyreg Paddlehorn|x=3519|y=3284|r=3|mtype=square|caption=Cyreg's location, east of Mort'ton.|width=250|height=250}}\nFind [[Cyreg Paddlehorn]]. He is located on the eastern edge of Mort'ton, near his boat at the bridge leading to the Barrows. Attempt to persuade him to bring you to [[the Myreque]]. Cyreg will be very secretive about how to find them though, so you will have to choose the correct sequence of responses to make him feel guilty in order for him to allow you to use his boat. The steel weapons must all be in the inventory to continue dialogue, so Ironmen may choose to come back with the planks if inventory space is a challenge. Choose the following responses in this order:\n#''Well, I guess they'll just die without weapons... (2)''\n#''Resourceful enough to get their own steel weapons? (2)''\n#''If you don't tell me, their deaths are on your head! (3)''\n#''What kind of man are you to say that you don't care? (3)''\n\nHe will decline to take you himself, allowing you to take it yourself instead, but you must have six wooden [[plank]]s. They are sold in [[Razmire Builders Merchants]], [[Mort'ton]]'s [[general store]], but you must have (partially) completed [[Shades of Mort'ton]] and cured [[Razmire Keelgan]] with [[Serum 208]] to use it. Do not repair the bridge before talking to Cyreg (if you already have, you will still need to bring the planks and nails). When you give him three of the planks, he will give you directions and you can now finally board the boat, though he won't let you travel unless you are carrying your [[druid pouch]] with at least five charges. (A [[Silver sickle (b)|blessed silver sickle]] is recommended to refill your pouch.) Also, be sure to take the [[Swamp Boaty]] by paying the 10 gold or using the [[ring of charos (a)]], or you won't be able to proceed later on in the quest.\n\n===Myreque===\n[[File:In Search of the Myreque - Bridge repair.png|thumb|250px|Repairing the rope bridge.]]\n{{Map|3509,3448|align=right|width=250|height=250|mtype=square|r=3|caption=Location of the doors leading into the Myreque's hideout.}}\nOnce you land at [[The Hollows]], go north, avoiding the [[ghast]]s, until you see a strange tree. Climb up to see a damaged [[Rope bridge (The Hollows)|rope bridge]]. Mend the bridge as you walk along, which requires 75 [[steel nails]] per [[plank]] (225 steel nails total) and three [[plank]]s, and then climb down the other side of the bridge.\n\nGo north to the strange-looking hollow tree and talk to [[Curpile Fyod]] out front. Tell him you've brought the weapons for [[the Myreque]] and then answer some questions for him to prove that you are indeed telling the truth. If you fail to answer the questions correctly, you will be knocked unconscious and wake up at the boat again, but luckily the bridge will require no building the second time and your druid pouch will not need the full five charges to re-board the boat. Here are the answers to the possible questions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Question\n!Answer\n|-\n|'' Name the only female member of the Myreque.''||Sani Piliu\n|-\n|''Who is the leader of the Myreque in Mort Myre?''||Veliaf Hurtz\n|-\n|''What is the name of the boatman who helps the Myreque?''||Cyreg Paddlehorn\n|-\n|''Which member of the Myreque was originally a scholar?''||Polmafi Ferdygris\n|-\n|''Who is the youngest member of the Myreque?''||Ivan Strom\n|-\n|''What vampyre family rules over Morytania?''||Drakan\n|}\n\nWhen you have correctly answered the guard's questions, circle around his tree to the north, and you will see a set of doors in the earth (they are unlocked after you've answered the questions). Enter and proceed to follow the path to the north west. Halfway up there is an alcove to the east and on the southern wall of this alcove is the cave entrance to enter (this texture can be a little hard to see, its in the south eastern corner of the alcove).\n\nStart off by talking to [[Veliaf Hurtz|Veliaf]]; then, talk to all of the others before coming back to Veliaf. It isn't necessary to actually ask any questions of them (you don't need any more info to finish the quest); just say, \"I'll be back later\", and talk to another one.\n\nGo back and talk to Veliaf again. He will now accept your weapons, however...\n\n===Vanstrom Klause===\nWhen finished, give the weapons to [[Veliaf Hurtz|Veliaf]]. A [[cutscene]] ensues where a strange mist envelopes the room, and Veliaf realises that it is a [[vampyre]]. The mist shifts, revealing [[Vanstrom Klause]], the stranger you were trying to help. He transforms into his vampyre form and kills [[Sani Piliu]] and [[Harold Evans]] with Blood Burst. After performing the murders, Vanstrom disappears, before summoning a level 97 [[Skeleton Hellhound]] (his \"little gift\") to finish off the remaining members. In order to regain [[the Myreque]]'s trust after having lured Vanstrom to them, you must kill the hellhound.\n[[File:In Search of the Myreque - Skeleton Hellhound safespot.png|thumb|The safespot for killing the hellhound with magic attacks.]]\nThe hellhound only has 55 [[Hitpoints]], but hits fairly hard; lower levels should bring [[food]]. [[Magic]] is extremely effective compared to [[Melee]], as it has no Magic [[Defence]]. If you have access to [[Protect from Melee]], the fight will be much easier. If using Magic you can [[safespot]] the hellhound by getting it stuck on the south side of the chair located on the eastern side of the room.\n\nTalk to Veliaf Hurtz, who'll say he needs to speak to his superior in order to instate you into the Myreque; you can also ask him more questions about the Myreque and Vanstrom. Finally, ask him how to leave the hideout; he tells you about a secret passage to [[Canifis]]. Leave the chamber, and search the wall at the end of the tunnel; it will open. Now, climb up the ladder.\n\n====The Myreque shortcut====\n{{Main|Myreque Hideout}}\n[[File:The Hollows map.png|frame|centre|The dungeon underneath [[Hair of the Dog]] Inn houses the [[Myreque Hideout|Myreque's hideout]].]]\n{{Map|3495,3464|align=right|width=250|height=250|mtype=square|r=3|caption=The Myreque shortcut can be accessed via the trapdoor behind the Canifis pub.}}\nYou will surface south of the tavern. The nearby trapdoor leads back to the cave, which you can use as an alternate route back to [[Mort'ton]] in the future.\n:'''Note:''' Exiting through the trap door is a requirement of the quest. Exiting through the [[fairy ring]] or other method will require travelling here again to complete the quest. You can not return by fairy ring until the quest is completed.\n\nProceed back into the tavern and seek out [[Vanstrom Klause]], only to find that Vanstrom isn't there but only a [[Stranger (In Search of the Myreque)|Stranger]]. Speak to him to complete the quest.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = In Search of the Myreque\n|image = [[File:In Search of the Myreque reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Attack|600}} [[Attack]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Defence|600}} [[Defence]] experience\n*{{SCP|Strength|600}} [[Strength]] experience\n*{{SCP|Hitpoints|600}} [[Hitpoints]] experience\n*{{SCP|Crafting|600}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*Access to [[The Hollows|the Hollows]]\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Skeleton Hellhound]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n* Lore associated in-game [[Title|Membership of The Myreque]]. \n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of In Search of the Myreque is required for the following:\n*[[In Aid of the Myreque]]\n*[[Morytania Diary#Medium|Morytania Diary (Medium)]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 22 March 2006\n|update = In Aid of the Myreque\n|change = The quest was renamed back from \"In search of the Myreque\" to \"In Search of the Myreque\".\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|daterange = 26 January -<br/>25 June 2005\n|update = \n|change = The quest was renamed from \"In Search of the Myreque\" to \"In search of the Myreque\".\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n{{In Search of the Myreque}}"

He will explain to you that the Sinclairs have packed up and left after incriminating [[Anna]] as Lord Sinclair's murderer. This, however, may not be the same person you proved to be guilty in [[Murder Mystery]]. Gossip will explain that one of the family members provided new evidence to prove Anna's guilt. He will then go on to explain that [[King Arthur]] and his knights disappeared at the same time as the family's departure. Agree to investigate, and you will start the quest.\n\nNow, speak to the [[Guard (Sinclair Mansion)|guard]] who suspects that the Sinclairs have something to do with the mysterious disappearance of the king of [[Camelot]] and his knights. He suspects that since [[Lord Sinclair]] gave King Arthur the castle, the disappearances may be part of a bigger plot to reclaim Camelot. The guard will explain that the [[Seers' Council]] has forbidden anyone to enter Sinclair Mansion or Camelot to investigate and will so pass on the investigation to you.\n\n===Investigating===\n[[File:King's Ransom scrap paper.png|thumb|120px|Scrap paper]]Break the window on the east side of the mansion, and you shall be inside. Now obtain the following pieces of evidence from their respective locations:[[File:King's Ransom address form.png|thumb|120px|Address form]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Evidence\n!Location\n|-\n|{{plink|Scrap paper}}\n|Dining room on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}. The paper contains incomplete scribblings about [[Camelot]].\n|-\n|{{plink|Address form}}\n|{{FloorNumber|uk=1}} library and take an [[address form]] that was never filled out, proving that the Sinclairs left for good, and never intended to tell anyone where they were moving.\n|-\n|{{plink|Black knight helm}}\n|{{FloorNumber|uk=1}} library, western bookcase.\n|}\nReturn to the [[Guard (Sinclair Mansion)|guard]] by right clicking the window and click on 'break' to get through, and present to him all three pieces of evidence. The guard will agree that there is enough evidence to prove malintent towards [[King Arthur]]. He says that since he has to follow proper proceedings that he will have to wait a month before presenting the evidence. You will offer to avoid the bureaucracy. He will then suggest that you learn more about the Sinclair family history, suggesting that town gossips know much about history.\n\nTalk to [[Gossip]]. There are three options to ask. Ask all three to learn the Sinclair history.\n\nThe first two conversations are about the family history. Gossip will explain [[Lord Sinclair]] was a good friend of [[King Ulthas]] and did many good things for [[Kandarin]]. His children, however, were spoiled and horrid, but Gossip admits he didn't think they would commit murder. The second is about the mansion. He will explain that originally the Sinclairs lived in [[Camelot]] (then, under a different name). Lord Sinclair eventually sold the castle to King Arthur and his men. They packed up and built the [[Sinclair Mansion]]. His children were furious. The third option is about [[Anna]]. Gossip will tell you that she is in the courthouse in [[Seers' Village]], giving a really hard time to the authorities. Gossip is positive Anna will receive a guilty verdict.\n\nHead to the [[Seers' Village Courthouse|courthouse]] in Seers' Village (the building directly south of the mansion and south-east of the bank), and speak to Anna. She will say that the original murderer you suspected set her up. She will go on to explain that no one will believe her. She says the new evidence against her was forged. You will then ask her where her family has gone; she will say she doesn't know since she's been locked up. As you go to leave, she will make a deal to help you get into Camelot in exchange for help in receiving a not-guilty verdict. She will then hand you the [[criminal's thread]] that you found on the window in [[Murder Mystery]]. Anna will suggest that the servants may be able to provide testimony in her defence.\n\n'''Note: It is possible to skip the following section and obtain a not guilty verdict.''' Just walk down the stairs in the courthouse, and the trial will begin. Asking the servants questions does not advance the quest and is only purposeful for those who wish to do so or want to (re-)solve the case themselves.\n\nReturn to the mansion to learn what the various servants will state during the trial. There are '''six''' in total, two of them being located outside of the mansion and the other four being located within it (once again, enter via the broken window to get inside). Ask them every possible question.\n\nThe first question will gather information on what happened the night of the murder.\n\nThe second question will gather information on where they last saw Anna on that fateful night.\n\nThe third question will gather information on whom they ever saw handling the dagger.\n\nThe fourth question will gather information on whom the thread may belong to.\n\nThe fifth question will gather information on the poison.\n\nAfter talking to every servant (six in total), head to the lower level of Seers' Village courthouse to begin the trial.\n\n===The trial===\n{{Needed|[[Criminal's thread]]}}\n[[File:King's Ransom - court in session.png|thumb|220px|right|The trial begins.]]During the trial, you will call witnesses by talking to the judge, and question the witness by talking to the witness. The questions you may ask correspond to those asked while in the mansion. To get a not-guilty verdict, you must rebut the evidence provided:\n\n*Anna's fingerprints on the dagger\n*Anna having bought poison and not used it\n*A thread from Anna's clothing being found at the crime scene\n*Anna being at the scene of the crime\n\nTo successfully clear [[Anna]] of the charges, you must rebut this evidence without accidentally providing more incriminating evidence against Anna (for example, bringing out testimony which puts Anna near Lord Sinclair's meal before he died). To do this, call the following witnesses with the following questions:\n\n*Call the [[Hobbes|'''butler''']] as a witness, and ask him about the '''dagger'''.\n*Call the [[Pierre|'''dog handler''']], and ask him about the '''poison'''.\n*Call the [[Mary (Murder Mystery)|'''maid''']], and ask her about '''what she saw the night of the murder'''.\n*Call '''anyone''' and ask about the '''thread''' to complete the case for the defence.\n\nThe judge will end the trial and ask for a verdict. The jury will provide a not-guilty verdict against Anna.\n\n===Back to business===\n[[File:King's Ransom statue.png|thumb|220px|Secret passage]]\nLeave the courtroom by clicking the gate; then, talk to [[Anna]] in her cell. She will go back to being rude, but will tell you how to enter [[Camelot]].\n\nHead to the east side of [[Camelot Castle]], and search the [[statue (King's Ransom)|statue]] near the temple.\n\n[[File:King's Ransom confrontation.png|220px|thumb|left|Confronting Anna and Morgan.]]\nYou will now see a cutscene of Anna talking to [[David (Murder Mystery)|David]]. The siblings were both responsible for Lord Sinclair's death, and set you up to trap you. They will explain they have no intention to help you. Suddenly, [[Morgan Le Faye]] will appear and knock you out with her staff.\n\n===In jail===\nAfter being knocked out by [[Morgan Le Faye]], you will wake up in a jail with Arthur's Knights and [[Merlin]].\n\nSpeak to Merlin. He will explain that:\n\n*[[King Arthur]] has been turned to a granite statue and taken away by the [[Black Knight]]s.\n*Both the Sinclairs and Morgan Le Faye have teamed up to destroy Arthur and reclaim [[Camelot]] castle.\n*The black knights have also agreed to help Morgan Le Faye and the Sinclairs.\n*Morgan Le Faye has stolen the [[Holy grail (item)|Holy Grail]].\n\n====Freeing Merlin====\n[[File:King's Ransom - Freeing Merlin.png|thumb|right|220px|Freeing Merlin]]\nAsk [[Merlin]] what to do. Follow all of the available conversation options.\n\nClick on the [[vent (King's Ransom)|vent]] at the top of the wall opposite the jail gate inside the cell. A funny animation will show Merlin escaping with the help of all the knights making a pyramid, allowing him to reach the vent.\n\n'''Note:''' If you need to leave during this portion of the quest, click on the vent again and the knights will lift you out of the cell. To continue the quest later on, make your way back to Camelot and click on the [[gate (Camelot)|gates]] or search the statue again to be teleported back into the cell by Morgan Le Faye.\n\n====Freeing the Knights====\n[[File:Guard combing.png|thumb|right|220px|Using Telekinetic Grab to obtain the hair clip.]]\nIf you brought the runes for it, use [[Telekinetic Grab]] on the guard fixing his hair outside the cell to obtain a [[hair clip]] and use it on the metal door. Otherwise, talk to all of the knights and ask them if they have anything useful to help them escape. You will get a lot of items such as an [[air rune]], a [[law rune]], an [[vial|empty vial]], a cooked [[shark]], a [[normal log]], a bottle of [[vodka]], etc. If you received a [[lockpick]], use it on the metal door; if you received runes, obtain the hair clip from the guard.\n\nYou will need to solve a puzzle to unlock the jail lock. The puzzle very closely resembles the popular game [[Wikipedia:Mastermind (board game)|Mastermind]].\n\nTo complete this puzzle, you must set each of four tumblers to the correct height. The most foolproof way to do this (not necessarily the quickest) is to set all tumblers to the lowest height of 0/5, and try the lock. If a tumbler shows a green circle, do not change that tumbler anymore. For all the other tumblers, increase the height by one and try again. If you see a red circle, do not try that height on any other tumblers. Continue until the lock unlocks. This method will take at most six attempts.\n\n[[File:King's Ransom locked jaildoor puzzle.png|thumb|220px|Puzzle]]\nYou will emerge on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} of the [[Keep Le Faye]]. Arthur's knights will be engaged in battle with the [[Renegade Knight]]s.\n\n===Finding the Holy Grail===\n[[File:King's Ransom riddle.png|thumb|220px|Riddle to the Holy Grail]]\nHead to the top floor and search on the [[table (King's Ransom)|table]] to the north. You will now have to solve a riddle (click on Show riddle) and choose the correct container holding the [[Holy grail (item)|Holy Grail]]. The correct box is the round purple one on the right, second last box if counting from left to right.\n\n:'''Note:''' Some of the boxes contain a trap which will deal 5 damage, drain a random skill by several levels, and teleport you to near the [[Cave entrance (Clivet)|cave entrance]] just north of [[Ardougne Monastery]]. To continue the quest, you will have to either try opening the door to [[Keep Le Faye]], click on the gates of Camelot, or search the statue again. [[Morgan Le Faye]] will then appear and will teleport you back to jail. There, you don't need to solve the door puzzle again—you just have to open the door and walk back to the top floor.\n\n===Freeing King Arthur===\n{{Needed|[[Bronze med helm]], [[Iron chainbody]], [[Animate rock scroll]], [[Granite]] (any size), [[Black full helmet]], [[Black platebody]], [[Black platelegs]]/[[Black plateskirt|skirt]], [[Holy grail (item)|Holy Grail]]|recommended=[[Ardougne teleport (tablet)|Ardougne tab]], [[Mind altar teleport (tablet)|Mind altar tab]], [[Camelot teleport (tablet)|Camelot tab]]}}\nYou must now free [[King Arthur]] from his stone prison. Head to [[Wizard Cromperty]] in [[East Ardougne]].\n\nCromperty will explain you need to free King Arthur like you did to [[Petra Fiyed]] during [[One Small Favour]], though this time, you also need to unravel [[Morgan Le Faye|Morgan]]'s spell. He will give you an [[animate rock scroll]]—you will need to use on King Arthur once you have both the [[Holy grail (item)|Holy Grail]] and some [[granite]] in your inventory.\n\n:'''Note:''' Even if you already have the Animate scroll, you will still need to go talk to Wizard Cromperty, or your player will not be willing to cast the spell on King Arthur. '''Be sure to completely finish the dialogue after receiving the scroll, or you will need to return and speak with him again. If you have the animate scroll in your bank he will not give you another one.'''\n\nTo actually get to King Arthur, you will need to have a [[bronze med helm]], [[iron chainbody]], [[black platebody]], [[black platelegs]]/[[Black plateskirt|skirt]] and [[black full helmet]].\n\n:'''Tip:''' Get the bronze med helm and iron chainbody in [[Draynor Manor]] and at [[Wayne's Chains]] in [[Falador]] respectively if you still need them. Alternatively, you can purchase both at the Warriors' Guild if you have access.\n\nHead to the [[Black Knights' Fortress (location)|Black Knights' Fortress]] west of [[Edgeville]]/north of [[Ice Mountain]]. (A [[Mind altar teleport (tablet)|Mind altar teleport]] is the closest teleport. Alternatively, teleport to [[Burthorpe]] with a [[Games necklace]], use the [[Tight-gap (Goblin Village)|Tight-gap]] and continue east along the [[Wilderness Ditch|Wilderness ditch]].)\n\nEquip the [[black equipment]], and enter the Black Knights' Fortress through the guards' door. Then, push the wall right behind the guards' door. You cannot push the wall if you are not wearing full black armour.[[File:King's Ransom arthur statue.png|thumb|220px|King Arthur turned into a stone statue.]]Climb down the ladder, and you will see King Arthur's statue. Use the ''Free'' option.\n\nTalk to King Arthur, and give him the guard uniform (bronze med helm and iron chainbody).\n\nReturn to [[Camelot]] and speak to King Arthur in his castle to finish the quest and receive your reward.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = King's Ransom\n|image = [[File:King's Ransom reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = * {{SCP|Defence|33,000}} experience\n* {{SCP|Magic|5,000}} experience\n*Antique [[lamp]] granting 5,000 [[experience]] to any skill level 50 or above\n*Access to the [[Knight Waves Training Grounds]]\n*The ability to use the [[Chivalry]] and [[Piety]] prayers, with level 60 and 70 [[Prayer]], respectively, after completion of [[Knight Waves Training Grounds]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of King's Ransom is required for the following:\n*[[Knight Waves Training Grounds]]\n*Hard tier of the [[Morytania Diary]]\n*Hard tier of the [[Kandarin Diary]]\n\n==Music==\n*[[Knightmare]]\n*[[Lore and Order]]\n*[[The Sinclairs]]\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 10 September 2015\n|update = Slayer Assignment Rework\n|change = A cutscene in the King's Ransom quest has been fixed, it was cutting off King Arthur's poor head.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*When the quest was introduced in ''[[RuneScape 2]]'', the [[Party Room]] was moved from [[Seers' Village]] to [[Falador]] to make room for the [[Seers' Village Courthouse]].\n**When finding [[Anna]] not guilty, Party Room balloons fall down. This is because of the Party Room being here previously, as stated by the judge when talking to him after the acquittal, and the [[prosecutor]] also tells of the problem they have with the [[dancing knight]]s.\n*If you talk to [[Merlin]] after the quest, he will give you a [[hair clip]] as a memory of the adventure.\n*When in jail, one of the knights is playing with a baseball; it's a reference to the movie ''{{wp|The Great Escape}}'' with {{wp|Steve McQueen}}.\n*When the Knights of the Round Table die in battle at [[Keep Le Faye]], they simply respawn where they were killed.\n*When discussing with Merlin how to escape, your character asks if he's going to turn everyone into fish and swim out. This is a reference to the 1963 Disney animated movie ''{{wp|The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone}}''.\n*Despite the 65 [[Defence]] requirement not being boostable, if the quest hasn't been started and the player [[boosts]] to 65 Defence, the quest log will show the requirement as being met.\n*The Holy Grail riddle section is a reference to {{WP|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}, where Hermione solves a very similar riddle.\n*In [[Murder Mystery]], the player remarks that the [[Sinclair Guard dog|Sinclair guard dog]] would bark loudly at any intruder. Sure enough, after the player breaks the window and enters the house, the dog begins barking.\n*When talking to Wizard Cromperty about freeing King Arthur, he wonders aloud whether using a magical item that turns someone into stone on King Arthur would free him. You can use the [[ring of stone]] on King Arthur to free him without consuming granite.\n*To enter the Sinclair Mansion at the start of the quest, you have to break a smashed window, which already doesn't make much sense. Subsequently, you have to break the already-broken smashed window to enter or exit the mansion.\n\n{{King's Ransom}}"

He can be found on a platform near the [[protester]]s. He will explain that the previous king's daughter was supposed to take over the throne, but the [[Kourend Council]] seems to have taken control for themselves; agree to help him to start the quest, and Martin will explain what needs to be done. He tells you to talk to [[Commander Fullore]] on the ground floor of the castle.\n\n[[File:A Kingdom Divided - Tomas Lawry appears.png|thumb|right|Tomas Lawry arrives to take over the investigation.]]\nTalk to the Commander and she will explain that the council is actually very beneficial to Kourend, and she will agree to have you help find [[Sophia Hughes]], given that you follow her orders. Say \"Let's get going\" and you will see a cutscene, where [[Tomas Lawry]] will claim to have the authority to lead this investigation. After the cutscene is finished, enter the house just north of you, and search the scenery around the house to find clues where Hughes may have gone. The objects that can be searched are:\n* {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}: 4 shelves, 2 tables, 4 cabinets, roses\n* {{FloorNumber|uk=1}}: Bathtub, desk, dresser, chest, bed, 3 drawers, 2 wardrobes\n* {{FloorNumber|uk=2}}: Table, skeleton\n** Note: Watch out for the [[lesser demon]] (level 82) on the top floor.\nNote: You do not need all of the clues to continue with the quest. You only need to search the drawers by the door to the bedroom on {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} to get the [[Receipt (A Kingdom Divided)|receipt]].\n\nIf you want all of the clues, they are:\n{{Checklist|\n* [[Rose (A Kingdom Divided)|Rose]]\n* [[Kourend map]]\n* [[Demonic incantations]]\n* [[Order form]]\n* [[Delivery confirmation]]\n* [[Bloody knife]]\n* [[Receipt (A Kingdom Divided)|Receipt]]\n* [[Bone (A Kingdom Divided)|Bone]]\n* [[Cultist robe]]\n}}\n\nInspect the [[Receipt (A Kingdom Divided)|receipt]], and it will indicate that there is an order for a bed at [[The Deeper Lode]]. Talk to Tomas Lawry by the roses in the house where you searched for clues and tell him you have found something that might be useful. Due to his incompetence, you will tell him that Sophia may have gone to [[Mount Quidamortem]] and he goes there without question. Talk to Fullore again and you will tell her that you suspect Hughes may have gone to the Deeper Lode.\n\nGo to the Deeper Lode, the pub in [[Lovakengj]], and talk to [[Fuggy]]. A quick method of getting there is by using the [[Jewellery of jubilation]] teleport on [[Kharedst's memoirs]] and running east. Ask him if he has had any councillors stay there recently, and he will say he's only had one human customer lately, a woman who did not look like a councillor. He will mention that he overheard her saying she was going to catch a ship in [[Port Piscarilius]]. Upon asking which ship it was, the ground will shake briefly, after which he will say she was going to catch [[Veos]]'s ship.\n\n===Standing before the Judge===\n[[File:A Kingdom Divided - confronting Sophia Hughes.png|thumb|The player and Commander Fullore confront Sophia Hughes.]]\n{{Needed|recommended=[[Food]] and [[combat equipment]] to defeat the level 168 [[Judge of Yama]] with melee.}}\n\nGo to [[Veos]]'s ship in [[Port Piscarilius]] and talk to [[Cabin Boy Herbert]], who has taken Veos's place. He will say Veos just wandered off in a trance right after the earthquake. Ask him if he has seen the councillor, and he will tell you that the ship is about to leave soon. A cutscene will start where you confront Hughes, who will claim that all her crimes were coordinated with the rest of the council and that she is being betrayed by them to save themselves. She will hint at playing a role in getting rid of the old king and his daughter. She will then summon a [[Judge of Yama]] to eliminate the two of you, but because she had \"taken advantage\" of Yama's generosity, the demon incinerates her before focusing on the two of you, also deeming you a threat to Yama. You will challenge the demon, who will agree to remove the \"sins\" you committed if you defeat it in combat.\n\n[[File:Fighting the Judge of Yama.png|thumb|250px|The player is challenged to a fight by the Judge of Yama.]]\n\n==== The Fight ====\nThe [[Judge of Yama]] is immune to [[magic]] and [[ranged]] damage, meaning it is only vulnerable to [[melee]]. The demon itself also only attacks with [[melee]] when up close, but it will occasionally teleport you further on the docks, and cast [[Fire Wave (Judge of Yama)|waves of fire]] towards you; since it can only be damaged with melee, you need to pass through the waves to reach the boss.\n\nThe battle takes place on a thin pier of 4 squares wide, where the demon will cast three waves of fire towards you. This leaves a single square without a wave, which can be used to dodge the attack completely. Use these gaps to walk closer towards the demon, and then attack it. If you run into a wave of fire, you will take moderate damage and be inflicted with a minor burn. Repeat this if you get teleported back away from the demon, until it dies. Players with decent Hitpoints (70+) may find it easier to simply run through the waves back to the Judge and tank the damage.\n\nIf you die or have to teleport for any reason throughout the fight with the Judge of Yama, there will be a portal to re-enter the battle near Veos's ship in Port Piscarilius. If you die, the gravestone appears by this portal.\n\n===Kourend's Last Princess===\n{{Needed|[[Axe]], [[runes]] to cast a [[Fire spells|fire spell]] higher than [[Fire Strike]] ([[Fire Bolt]] works).|recommended=[[Xeric's talisman]] or [[Kharedst's memoirs]] for quick transport around [[Great Kourend|Kourend]], [[games necklace]], [[food]] and [[combat equipment]] to defeat a level 132 [[Assassin (A Kingdom Divided)|Assassin]].}}\n[[File:A Kingdom Divided - Andrews thanks.png|thumb|Councillor Andrews expresses his gratitude for dealing with the demon.]]\nA cutscene will play where [[Councillor Andrews]] will thank you for your help, and tell you they will be investigating how Hughes managed to escape. Meanwhile, he will ask you to tell [[Martin Holt]] that the issue with Sophia Hughes is resolved, so he and the other protesters should go home. Before doing that, however, [[Commander Fullore]] will ask you to meet her outside the castle. She will be standing just south of the castle, directly north of the [[Shayzien mine]] (accessible through the small door in the south wall of the castle).\n\nTalk to the commander, and she will discuss the things Hughes said on the docks. She will give some backstory regarding the old king, and his daughter called Rose. Fullore will ask you to investigate the council's conspiracy against the royalty, and recommends you start by talking to [[Martin Holt]]. Martin is the leader of the Kourend [[Royal Society]], and the expert on the old royal family. He may know where Rose is. Talk to him to ask him about Rose's whereabouts. He will mention that Rose wrote [[Kharedst's memoirs]], which were recently auctioned off. However, Rose's personal diary is still in the [[Library Historical Archive]]. He will ask you to talk to [[Archeio]] in the [[Arceuus Library]], who will teleport you to the Archive.\n\nIn the Archive, pickpocket [[Istoria]] to obtain a [[bluish key]]. Use it to open the purple display case in the eastern wall of the south-eastern corner of the room to obtain [[Rose's diary]]. Read it, and you will not find anything of note. Go back to [[Martin Holt|Martin]], and talk to him while holding Rose's diary. He will find [[Rose's note|a note]] in the cover of the book, and read through it. After that he hands it to you. Read it, to find some instructions on where to find more information. Talk to Martin again, and he will tell you to split up from him and figure out what the location is the note is hinting at.\n\nGrab an [[axe]] from your bank, and head to the [[Forthos Ruin]]s. Talk to Martin on the west side of the northern entrance, and he will explain what the note meant, and why this must be the location. After giving some explanations on his past involvement with the Council, his relationship with [[Commander Fullore]], and the corruption that goes on inside the current government of Kourend.\n\nSearch the four stone piles around the ruins to figure out the number combination. Write these down. Each stone pile has an inscription where a letter is mapped to a number. For example, a tile may say \"S - 9\", which means the letter S maps to the number 9. The combination required is random for all players, so note down the numbers. Chop the vines just south of [[Martin Holt]], and squeeze through them. On the east wall of this small room, check the panel. Fill in the number combination that matches the numbers for \"ROSE\". Doing so will give you another [[Rose's note#Forthos Ruin|note]]. Read it, and talk to Martin again. You will split up again, and meet at the next location.\n\n[[File:A Kingdom Divided - fighting assassin.png|thumb|right|The player and Martin are ambushed by an assassin.]]\nGrab runes to cast a fire spell, [[Fire Bolt]] or higher works. Head to the [[Settlement Ruins]], just south-west of the [[Wintertodt Camp]]. Beware of the aggressive [[ice wolf|ice wolves]], [[ice giant|giants]] and [[ice spider|spiders]]. Martin can be found in the north-western building in the ruins. Talk to him, and you will be attacked by a level 132 [[Assassin (A Kingdom Divided)|Assassin]]. He will exclaim that he is there to kill Martin. Kill him. The assassin will attack with a [[dragon dagger]] and [[dragon dart]]s, so protection prayers will not be able to block all damage. Regardless, this fight should not be too difficult compared to the fight with the demon.\n\nMartin will believe that the Council had hired assassins to kill him, but you quickly point that the assassin only mentioned Martin, thus ruling the decision out.\n\nYou now need to find a key to the panel in the ruins. Cast [[Fire Bolt]] or a higher fire spell on the Ice chunks in just west of the southern part of the building you're in. This melts the ice, which means you can retrieve the [[cold key]] from it by searching the chunks. Check the panel on the western wall of the building near Martin. You will find another [[Rose's note#Settlement Ruins|note]]. Read it, and talk to Martin again to move on to the next location.\n\nTravel to [[The Legless Faun]], the pub in the south-western corner of [[Port Piscarilius]]. Speak to Martin again, and he will give some more information about the situation. You will have to climb the pillar just west of Martin, to reach the upper floor of the pub building. Search the panel on the northern wall of the building, and take note of the order the cities are listed in. Climb down the wall again, and inspect the statues in the '''same''' order as given on the panel; press it in for each of the statues. If you did it right, you will hear a click nearby. Climb back up the pillar and check the panel to receive [[Rose's note#The Legless Faun|the final note]].\n\nA cutscene will play of you looking over the balcony, observing Lawry arrest Martin for inciting protests against the Council, leaving you on your own. Read the note to find the final location in the hunt for Rose. This is located at the small house just south of [[Mount Karuulm]], and can be easily reached by travelling west of the [[Fairy ring]] {{fairycode|cir}} or teleporting to the [[Farming Guild]] with a [[skills necklace]] and running north-east. Search the [[bed (tatty note)|bed]] to find a [[tatty note]]. Read it to discover it's a letter to Rose from a certain \"L.O.\" Inspect the crates in the north-western corner of the shack, and climb down the hidden trapdoor. (''Note: The option to inspect the crates will not appear until you've read both notes.'')\n\nA cutscene will play of a woman − presumably Rose − lying on a large stone on the side of the underground room. A man will walk in, identifying himself as [[Councillor Orson|Councillor Liam Orson]], of the [[Kourend Council]]. After a short conversation you will bring in Fullore, and together you get Orson to confess, where he reveals that he and the others killed the King to save the kingdom and that Rose is being kept alive by potions from a mysterious mage that resided with the lizardmen.\n\nIf you accidentally click anywhere other than the chat box during the cutscene it will end and put you back in the shack. You can inspect the crates again to resume.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nA Kingdom Divided - Martin Holt is arrested.png|Martin is arrested by Tomas Lawry.\nA Kingdom Divided - Councillor Orson confesses.png|The player discovers Rose and Councillor Orson.\n</gallery>\n\n===The Mysterious Mage===\n{{Needed|[[Weapons|Weapon]] and [[armour]] to kill [[Xamphur]], [[food]] and [[prayer potion]]s.}}\n\nGear up for the fight against [[Xamphur|a level 239 enemy]] that uses several special mechanics. Using a ranged weapon such as a [[Toxic blowpipe]] will make the fight much easier, though armour with good magic defence such as [[Dragonhide armour]] should be brought even with melee. For melee bring an [[Abyssal whip]] or better if possible, though a [[Dragon scimitar]] will also suffice. If you are a low combat level (~80), bring at least 3-4 [[Prayer potion]]s and 20+ high-healing food such as [[Shark]]s. You should also bring an emergency one-click teleport such as a [[Teleport tab]].\n\nHead to the [[Lizardman Temple]] in [[Molch]] - use a skills necklace to teleport to the Farming Guild and head south-east. Enter the temple via any of the Lizard dwelling entrances and head east through the middle hallway. Enter the room to the north, where you will find [[Kaht B'alam]]. Talk to him and ask him if he can help you find a mage, or as they call him, Yo'kal ahk. He will help you get to the mage, but in exchange he wishes to escape from the war against the humans. To do that, he wants to take his [[lizardman egg|last egg]] with him, and asks you to retrieve it for him.\n\nExit the temple through the strange hole at the west end of the hallway and head west in the swamp and go south across the stone bridge, to find several piles of Lizardman eggs. Search them until you find the right pile, at which point you will be attacked by a level 75 [[Lizardman brute]]. Kill the brute or run away from it, and return to Kaht with his egg. In return, he will give you a [[damp key]], which unlocks the small door on the northern wall in the corridor of the temple, very close to Kaht, next to the Bones on the floor. Opening this will put you in a small room that leads to a gate. Open the gate to start a cutscene, after which you will enter the boss fight with [[Xamphur]]. In the cutscene you will see two mysterious voices discussing the past events in the Kourend quest line. After some time, one of the voices will be revealed to be Xamphur, and the other voice turns out to be [[Veos]]. Veos will sense your presence and order Xamphur to eliminate you, who forcibly teleports you into his chamber and attacks.\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nA Kingdom Divided - eavesdropping on the mage.png|The player eavesdrops on the mysterious mage.\nA Kingdom Divided - Xamphur appears.png|Xamphur appears to kill the player.\n</gallery>\n\n==== The Fight ====\n[[File:Fighting Xamphur.png|thumb|280px|The player fights against Xamphur, one of [[Xeric]]'s closest comrades.]]\n[[Xamphur]] is immune to [[Magic]] attacks, and attacks primarily with magic; praying [[Protect from Magic]] will greatly reduce damage done by Xamphur's basic attack. It is recommended to use range against him if you are low level.\n\nAround the room, there are several Marks of Darkness on the floor. Walking over these will inflict a [[Mark of Darkness]] effect on you, causing his basic attack to become twice as effective, and cause [[Corruption (status)|corruption]] to happen twice as often, if you get corrupted by one of the other mechanics. Avoid these marks to fully avoid this effect; be aware that he can also bind you in place, so for this reason, it's critical to ensure that you're never standing on a Mark of Darkness.\n\nThe best method is to turn off auto retaliate and running, '''pick a row of tiles that you can move on, and only walk along that plane throughout the fight'''. This will also allow you to more easily avoid his hand crushing attack later in the fight.\n\nOther than the basic attack, he has two special mechanics, which he uses '''every ten attacks.''' He'll begin an attack by saying either {{overhead|You will fall by my hand}} or {{overhead|Your fate is in my hands}}.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Mechanic\n!Action\n!Pray\n|-\n|Hands will fall from ceiling, '''dealing up to 10 damage every tick''', for 5–10 seconds\n|Walk around the room, avoiding Marks of Darkness.\n\nStepping between two tiles, when timed correctly, will also work.\n|Magic\n|-\n|Two Phantom Hands spawn\n|'''Kill the hands as soon as possible'''.

If you died, your gravestone will be outside the door.\n\nAfter you have defeated Xamphur, he will state that your efforts to defeat him are amusing as he unleashes a powerful bolt of magic that seemingly kills you. There is then a short cutscene where two lizardmen come to dispose of your body, but run away when they hear you groan and think you are a zombie. After standing back up, search the table in the north wall of the room to read a note. The note reveals that Xamphur was responsible for the events that occurred during the quest [[The Ascent of Arceuus]]. After reading it, return to Fullore in the basement of the shack where you found Rose, near fairy ring code {{Fairycode|cir}}, by inspecting the crates again.\n\n===The Houses of Kourend===\nReturn to the basement and a cutscene will play where you explain to Fullore what just happened. Fullore will tell you that she researched the potions and confirmed Orson's statement that the potions were the only thing keeping Rose alive, and adds that Rose has been braindead since she was originally poisoned twenty years ago. She decides to mercy kill her to put her out of her misery before the two of you bury her outside the house. With the truth known, Fullore suggests that you speak to the leaders of the five Houses as they have the power to overthrow the council. Go past each of the five cities to ask their leader to come to [[Xeric's Lookout]].\n[[File:A Kingdom Divided - Rose's funeral.png|thumb|250px|The player and Commander Fullore bury Rose, the last princess of Great Kourend.]]\n\n{{Checklist|\n* [[Lord Arceuus]] is found in the upper level of the [[Tower of Magic]], north-west of Arceuus. Players can use the [[Arceuus Library Teleport]] spell or tablet and run west, or using a [[fairy ring]] (code {{Fairycode|CIS}}) and running south-west. Players can also use [[Kharedst's memoirs]] (\"A Dark Disposition\" teleport) and run north-west past the Library.\n* [[Lord Hosidius]] is found in the family mansion in [[Hosidius]], north-west of the [[vinery]]. [[Xeric's talisman]] (\"Xeric's Glade\" teleport) brings players a short distance from the mansion; players can also use [[Kharedst's memoirs]] (\"Lunch by the Lancilliums\" teleport) and run south, east across the bridge, and south again.\n* [[Lady Lovakengj]] is found in the [[Lovakengj Assembly]] in Lovakengj. Players can use [[Kharedst's memoirs]] (\"Jewellery of Jubilation\" teleport) and run westwards, or use [[Xeric's talisman]] (\"Xeric's Inferno\" teleport) and travel south.\n* [[Lady Piscarilius]] is found in [[The Warrens]] under [[Port Piscarilius]]. Players can use [[Kharedst's memoirs]] (\"The Fisher's Flute\" teleport) to teleport close to the entrance.\n* [[Lord Shayzien]] is found in the upper level of the [[War Tent]] in the [[Shayzien Encampment]].

A cutscene will play of the five leaders, Fullore, Orson and the player discussing what has happened, and confronting Orson with what he has done. After some discussion regarding what should happen after the council is deposed by the leaders of the five houses, [[Lord Kandur Hosidius]] will show the [[Royal Accord of Twill]] as a proposed solution to the issue.\n\nVisit the different floors of the lookout, including Lord Arceuus outside at the entrance, and talk to each of the leaders before doing any of their tasks in order to be able to do them all in one go. Each of them will share their opinions on following the Royal Accord. After speaking with Lady Lovakengj, you '''must''' speak with Commander Fullore and tell her you need help with Lady Lovakengj. After that, the tasks may be completed in any order.\n\n====Lady Lovakengj====\n{{Needed|[[Weapons|Weapon]] and [[armour]] to kill a level 132 [[Assassin (A Kingdom Divided)|assassin]]}}\n\nSpeak to Lady Lovakengj, who is now on the {{FloorNumber|uk=2}} of the lookout. She will wish to replace [[Councillor Andrews]] with [[Councillor Unkar]], so she must be convinced that Councillor Unkar is not innocent in this conspiracy. Talk to [[Commander Fullore]] and ask about Lady Lovakengj. She will recommend talking to [[Martin Holt]] to find Unkar's connection to the conspiracy. Martin can be found in the [[Shayzien Prison]], just west of the Graveyard of Heroes. Make sure you have spoken to [[Commander Fullore]] or you will not be able to speak with [[Martin Holt]].\n[[File:A Kingdom Divided - another assassin.png|thumb|250px|Jorra is ambushed by another assassin.]]\nGo west of Shayzien, to the Shayzien prison, very close to the [[Kharedst's memoirs]] ''History and hearsay'' teleport and just south-west of the southern Shayzien bank. Climb down the staircase and talk to Martin, who is in one of the four cells of the prison. A guard will initially stop you from talking to Martin, but relents when you claim to be on a task for the Council. Martin will say that he has no direct proof of [[Councillor Unkar]]'s involvement, but he will tell you to go to the Royal Society's meeting, and tell them the passphrase 'Evil only triumphs when the good do nothing.' to talk to Martin's contact, who is a dwarf. Go to the [[Graveyard of Heroes]] just east of the prison's entrance, and talk to [[Jorra]], Vulcana's assistant. Tell him the passphrase, and Jorra will start to give some information he found out. However, you will be attacked by an [[Assassin (A Kingdom Divided)|assassin]] again. Defeat the assassin and continue the conversation to receive a [[declaration]]. Read it to learn that there was a plan to overthrow Lady Lovakengj.\n\nReturn to Lady Lovakengj with the note, who will be shocked that Unkar had secretly tried to remove her. She will agree to sign the new accord.\n\n====Lord Hosidius====\n{{Needed|[[Weapons|Weapon]] and [[armour]] to kill a level 91 [[Barbarian Warlord]].}}\n[[File:A Kingdom Divided - fighting Barbarian Warlord.png|thumb|right|Phileas Rimor is discovered to have been imprisoned, and the Barbarian Warlord attacks.]]\nSpeak to Lord Hosidius in the basement of the lookout. He needs your help investigating Lord Shayzien's involvement in a [[barbarian camp]] just south of the lookout (he's located downstairs). Go to the barbarian camp in the [[Kourend Woodland]]s, just south-east of the [[Rada's blessing]] Kourend Woodland teleport destination. Go down the ladder next to the southern wall and [[Phileas Rimor]] will talk to you from a cell. A level 91 [[Barbarian Warlord]] who had Phileas captured will attack you. Kill him, and talk to Phileas again. He will say that he was captured by the barbarians, who said they were doing this as a task from someone. The barbarians also stole his package, King Shayzien VII's journal.\n\nReturn to Lord Hosidius, who will theorise that Shiro wanted to hide information that would link his house to Xeric. He will agree to sign the new accord.\n\n====Lord Shayzien====\nSpeak to Lord Shayzien on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the lookout. He will ask you to find [[King Shayzien VII]]'s journal in [[Lord Kandur Hosidius|Lord Hosidius]]' private office, which is hidden at the southern end of the Hosidius [[Vinery]]. You can use the Xeric's Talisman 'Glade' teleport and head east to the vinery, Tithe Farm mini game teleport and head north, or fairy ring AKR and head west. Inspect the eastern wine barrel to find a hidden trapdoor. Climb down, and picklock the chest in the corner of the room. You will obtain a [[Shayzien journal]]. You will need to bring this back to Lord Shayzien, who will agree to sign the accord.\n\n====Lady Piscarilius====\n{{Needed|[[molten glass]], [[dark essence block]] or a pickaxe and a [[chisel]]}}\nIf you do not already have a dark essence block, go to the [[dense essence mine]] to mine a [[dense essence block]] and then imbue it at the [[Dark Altar]].\n\nSpeak to Lady Piscarilius on the {{FloorNumber|uk=3}} of the lookout. She will wish to have the cult of [[Yama]] stopped by having an [[Arceuus]] mage named [[Mori]] attempt to stop the disciples of Yama's connection to Yama himself. To find Mori, head to the [[Arceuus]] church - you can use the Kharedst's memoirs teleport 'A Dark Disposition' and walk north (look for the Altar icon on the Worldmap). Mori can be found on the very top floor of the church.\n\nMori will explain her plan to disconnect the [[Voice of Yama]]'s connection to [[Yama]] himself, by using a connection to the [[Dark Altar]]. To do this, she needs some [[molten glass]] and a [[Dark essence block]]. Hand the items over to Mori, and she will give you a [[Dark nullifier]]. You must hide it somewhere in the [[Chasm of Fire]] to prevent the cult from contacting [[Yama]]. Go to the Chasm ([[fairy ring]] {{fairycode|djr}}) and try to climb down. The [[Disciple of Yama]] standing outside will interrupt you and take the device off you. You will be taken to the forest just south of the chasm, believing the device has been planted. Return to Shauna, who will agree to sign the accord despite insisting that it's a bad idea.\n\n====Lord Arceuus====\n{{Needed|[[Defence potion]] (3 or more doses) and [[Volcanic sulphur]]|recommended=[[Games Necklace]]}}\nSpeak to Lord Arceuus just outside of the lookout. He will ask you to investigate whether [[Xamphur]] is indeed the same mage as the one that served [[Xeric]] long ago. To do this, you must visit the [[Tasakaal]] in [[Mount Karuulm]] Rada's Blessing or (fairy ring {{Fairycode|cir}}) and show them the [[broken redirector]] for help.\n\nEnter [[Mount Karuulm]] ([[Boots of stone]] are not needed in this area), and talk to any of the Tasakaal sitting in the middle of the first room. The Tasakaal will analyse the broken redirector, and they will trace the history of the object. Many humans and people of Arceuus have used it, but also two others: one touched by fire, and one touched by darkness. The one touched by darkness was indeed one who served [[Xeric]], and the player concludes that the one touched by fire must be the pyromancer who damaged the [[Doors of Dinh]].\n\nTo prevent further damage to the Doors of Dinh, the Tasakaal will offer to create a potion that will reinforce the [[Dark Altar]]'s power on the Doors of Dinh. Use the [[Volcanic sulphur]] on a [[defence potion]] with '''at least''' 3 doses to create a [[sulphur potion]], and talk to the Tasakaal again to have them enchant it, turning it into a [[shielding potion]].\n\nTeleport to the Wintertodt Camp ([[Games necklace|Games Necklace]] or fairy ring {{Fairycode|CIS}}) and use the [[shielding potion]] on the [[Doors of Dinh]].\n\nReturn to Lord Arceuus, who you will inform that the Xamphur you met is the same as the Xamphur from back then, giving him much worry. You will also inform him that one of the Pyromancers colluded with Xamphur to sabotage the Doors of Dinh. While the information is of great importance, Lord Arceuus states that dealing with the Council comes first and will agree to sign the accord.\n\n===The Council's End===\n[[File:A Kingdom Divided - Councillor Orson's death.png|thumb|right|Councillor Orson's body is discovered outside Xeric's Lookout.]]\nReturn to the lookout and talk to each of the five leaders again to finish up their task. Some of the leaders will provide their insights on your discoveries. After that, talk to Fullore again, who reveals Orson's body being found at the bottom of the lookout tower, after he fell down from it, either from jumping, or being pushed. After that, all of the leaders will convene again in the basement, and they will all sign the accord. All leaders, including a reluctant Lord Shayzien, will agree to make Lord Hosidius the new king of Kourend. The accord is named Rose's Accord, in the honour of the unfortunate demise of Rose.\n\nAfter the cutscene, Commander Fullore will talk to you about the decision that was just made. She is confused that Lord Shayzien did not want to take up the leadership, and notes that Lord Hosidius wishes to talk to you. Go down the ladder again to speak with him, and he will explain the details of how he managed to convince Lord Shayzien not to make a bid for the throne. Lord Shayzien's attempted cover-up of the journal of King Shayzien VII, and his eventual capturing of [[Phileas Rimor]], would be too humiliating for him to be confronted with, so he decided to withdraw his attempts to become king.\n\nAfter this reveal, talk to Fullore again to start a long final cutscene. The remaining council members get arrested, and Lord Hosidius being crowned the new King of Kourend. A banquet is held to celebrate, with prominent guests from [[Great Kourend]], [[Misthalin]], [[Asgarnia]], [[Kandarin]] and [[Varlamore]]. You will have a talk with Lord Arceuus, who teaches you some spells discovered in [[Xamphur]]'s hideout. After that you'll have a short chat with Fullore, who points out the guests from [[Varlamore]]. After a coronation speech by the new king, you will have a private conversation with him in which he wishes to call on your services once more when they have enough information on Xamphur, but before the two of you can do anything, another assassin appears and assassinates him, claiming he has been marked for death and teleports away.\n\nAfter the cutscene concludes, speak with Commander Fullore a final time. She will express surprise that they buried a king just as fast as they crowned one, and that they commenced another crowning ceremony for his son, now king. She then hands you a reward for your work, as well as the book Lord Arceuus mentioned he would give you.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nFile:A Kingdom Divided - civil unrest at Kourend Castle.png|The protests approach a breaking point.\nFile:A Kingdom Divided - Lord Shayzien and Hosidius arrive.png|Lords Shayzien and Hosidius arrive to control the situation.\nFile:A Kingdom Divided - removing the Kourend Council.png|The Five Houses of Kourend declare the Council unfit to rule.\nFile:A Kingdom Divided - arriving at the coronation.png|The coronation of King Kandur Hosidius commences.\nFile:A Kingdom Divided - coronation toast.png|The King thanks the attendees for coming to his coronation, and toasts to the player, Martin, and Lydia for their efforts.\nFile:A Kingdom Divided - regicide.png|The king is killed by an assassin.\n</gallery>\n\n'''Congratulations, Quest Complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = A Kingdom Divided\n|image = [[File:A Kingdom Divided reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards =\n* The [[book of the dead]]\n* Two [[Antique lamp (A Kingdom Divided)|antique lamps]] giving 10,000 [[experience]] to any skill level 40 or above.\n** If players claimed the antique lamp from the [[Architectural Alliance]] miniquest before [[10 January]] [[2024]], they will only receive one lamp.\n* Ability to set your [[respawn point]] to [[Kourend Castle]].

When the quest was clicked on, the usual interface opened which formally announced the quest's release date:\n{{Cquote2|{{colour|#000080|Coming to}} {{colour|#800000|Old School RuneScape}} {{colour|#000080|on}} {{colour|#800000|June 16th 2021}}{{colour|#000080|...}}\n\n{{colour|#000080|Once it has been released, I can start this quest by talking to}} {{colour|#800000|Martin Holt}} {{colour|#000080|at the entrance to }} {{colour|#800000|Kourend Castle}} {{colour|#000080|in}} {{colour|#800000|Kingstown}}{{colour|#000080|.}}}}\n\nAround 17:42 (UTC) on the same day, an [[Unannounced phenomena|Unannounced phenomenon]] occurred, where players in various areas of the game had their screen rumble with accompanying messages in their chatbox, depending on where they were:\n* If players were in [[Great Kourend]] and the [[Kebos Lowlands]] the chatbox stated \"''{{Colour|#ef1020|The ground beneath you violently shakes.}}''\"\n** Players exclaimed {{overhead|What the... What was that?}} after the rumbling ended.\n* If players were anywhere else the chatbox stated \"''{{Colour|#ef1020|You hear a faint rumbling coming from the far west...}}''\"\n\n==Developers==\n* '''Main developer(s)''': [[Mod Ed]]\n* '''Quality Assurance''': [[Mod Curse]] and [[Mod Moogle]]\n* '''Art''': [[Mod Brow]], [[Mod Gee]], and [[Mod West]]\n\n==Trivia==\n* A Kingdom Divided is the first quest to have the chatbox in cutscenes be in the bottom-centre of the screen.\n*During one of the conversations with Martin, if the player has completed [[Song of the Elves]], [[King Lathas]] is brought up. The player will mention the former king of Ardougne being executed.\n*If the player has used a knife on the Kharedst's Memoirs to find the [[secret page]] there is additional dialogue between the player and Martin Holt.\n\n{{A Kingdom Divided}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kingdom Divided, A}}"

The [[Squire]] will tell you he lost [[Sir Vyvin]]'s sword, and would like you to help him replace it. He will tell you to talk to [[Reldo]], [[Varrock]]'s librarian.\n\n''Note: If you have completed [[The Giant Dwarf]], you may skip talking to Reldo and go straight to Thurgo. (Your character will mention to the squire that they already know an [[Imcando dwarf]])''\n\nGo to [[Varrock Palace]], and go to the far north room on the ground floor of the palace to find Reldo. Ask Reldo about Imcando dwarves. He will tell you that one is located south of [[Port Sarim]]. If you haven't already made or bought a [[redberry pie]], do it now. Consider getting two pies, if you're planning on doing [[The Giant Dwarf]] soon after this quest. Players can grab the [[pie dish]] spawn from the kitchen just east of the [[Varrock Palace Library|library]] if baking the pie themselves. [[Members]] can buy one from [[Romily Weaklax]] in the [[Cooks' Guild]] just west of Varrock (entry requires level 32 in [[Cooking]] and a [[chef's hat]]) (note: if you are an [[Ironman]] and have a low Cooking level it is useful to get the materials to bake multiple pies in case you burn one). When you have one, continue to Port Sarim and then head south.\n\n'''Note:''' You have to talk to Reldo before you talk to Thurgo\n\n===Thurgo the Imcando dwarf===\n{{Map|name=Thurgo|x=3001|y=3144|r=2|mtype=square|align=right|caption=The location of Thurgo, an Imcando dwarf.}}\n'''''Items required:''' [[Redberry pie]], suggested [[Falador teleport (tablet)|Falador teleport]] or [[fairy ring]] ({{Fairycode|aiq}}) (teleporting to [[Pest Control]] via [[minigame teleport]]s and then taking the boat is faster than walking or if house is in Rimmington, [[Teleport to House]] and then walk south)''\n\nYou should see a small house on the side of a hill with a red exclamation mark. Look for [[Thurgo]], who is an Imcando dwarf. Ask him if he would like some [[redberry pie]]. He'll take the one you have and eat it. Talk to him again to ask him about the sword. He says he'll need a picture of it. So, go back to [[Falador]] and talk to the [[Squire]] again.\n\n===Acquiring the picture===\n'''''Items required:''' none''\n\n'''Note:''' You have to talk to the Squire first before searching for the portrait.\n\nYou ''must'' go talk to the squire again who will tell you that [[Sir Vyvin]] has a portrait in his room. From the courtyard of the [[White Knights' Castle]] in [[Falador]], go east through three doors, and then up the ladder. Go west through the door and then further west through the open doorway, then up the stairs. Sir Vyvin's room will be directly to the south. Open and search the [[Cupboard (The Knight's Sword)|cupboard]] inside his room. You will obtain a portrait that shows the sword. However, Sir Vyvin will stop you if he is in the room. There are six ways to avoid this:\n\n*Hop worlds, it's the easiest way!\n*Have a friend talk to [[Sir Vyvin]] while you open and search the cupboard. You can also wait for Sir Vyvin to be out of the cupboard room if you don't have friend near.\n*Open the door to his room and wait for him to walk out.\n*Have the door open, and wait next to the cupboard. When Sir Vyvin walks behind the door, quickly search the cupboard.\n*The cupboard is searched while Sir Vyvin is not looking towards the player.\n*Search the cupboard while the door is open and Sir Vyvin is one space left of the door.\n\nOnce you have the portrait, you're done at [[White Knights' Castle]] for now.\n\n===Getting the iron bars (optional)===\n'''''Note: '''If you already have 2 iron bars (4 if you want your own sword), or will definitely buy them, skip this part. Bring food for all four of the alternative options below.''\n\nIf you don't already have the iron bars, you can get them very easily by buying them from the [[Grand Exchange]]. Make sure you bring them when you're going to [[Thurgo]] next, as it saves you a trip to a nearby bank. If you're an [[Ironman]], and you wish to obtain them without buying or [[Smithing]], you have 5 options. The first three involve killing (so at least the ability to survive a fight is necessary), the fourth one involves a trip to the [[Wilderness]]. The fifth one requires the completion of low-level quest 'Children of the Sun', and an iron bar spawns by Sunset Coast.\n\n====Killing dwarves====\nThe first one is to kill [[Dwarf|Dwarves]], head to either the ground floor or beneath the [[Dwarven Mines]] to find groups between combat level 10 & 14, which have a rare chance of dropping one iron bar. Make sure to loot them!\n\n====Killing pirates====\nThe second one is to take food from your bank, go to [[Thurgo]] without iron bars, talking to him, heading to the [[Asgarnia Ice Dungeon]] on the hill nearby and killing the [[Pirates]] there, as they have a rare chance of dropping one iron bar. They have a combat level of 26, and can be easily [[safespot]]ted.\n\n====Killing white knights====\nThe third one is to go to the [[White Knights' Castle]], bring some [[Magic]] (they have a weakness to Magic) or [[Ranged]] gear, and safespot [[White Knight|White Knights]] on the second floor of the castle, in the jail-like room. Compared to the [[Pirate]]-option above, this requires more effort to get there and to kill a single one, but the drop rate of iron bars for [[White Knight]]s (level 36, 38 and 42; '''not''' the level 39 ones) is uncommon instead of rare, and they can drop max. 2, instead of one. That makes it a viable option if you want to save time. They do have twice as many hitpoints compared to Pirates, so a high combat level (45+) is recommended.\n\n====Spawns====\n{{Map|height=200|mtype=pin|align=right|caption=The spawn point of an iron bar, north-west of [[Ferox Enclave]].|3111,3657}}\nThe fourth option: a single iron bar can be found west of the [[Graveyard of Shadows]] next to the [[bear]]s in some trees in level 18 Wilderness (hop to another world for more). Bring a [[teleport]] to get out of the [[Wilderness]] quickly after you have what you need.\nFor members, a single iron bar also spawns in Sunset Coast, requiring completion of Children of the Sun.\n\n===Getting the blurite===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[pickaxe]], food (recommended), the portrait, 2 [[Iron bar]]s (to save a bank trip - 4 if you want to make your own sword).''\n\n''Don't forget to bring your pickaxe for this next step, and if you are at a low [[combat level]], make sure that you take food with you as well! If needed there is an altar just north of the dungeon to restore prayer points.''\n\nNow that you have the portrait, talk to [[Thurgo]], and give it to him. He now knows what kind of a sword he is making, a [[blurite sword]], and he will need the materials to make the sword. You will have to enter the [[Asgarnia Ice Dungeon]] on the hill nearby to obtain the [[blurite ore]]s. All enemies in the cave are [[aggressive]], so bringing [[food]] could save your life. If bringing armour, it is recommended to bring plate armour or other slash-resistant equipment, as most enemies in the cave use [[Attack types|slashing attacks]]. It is also recommended that you only bring a good pickaxe if you want two blurite ores so that you can get your own sword (you also need a Blurite ore for the Falador Easy Achievement Diary - to smith Blurite limbs on [[Doric]]'s anvil). So, go down the ladder and walk through. When you see snow/ice ahead of you, be prepared to run. Run along the southern walls to find blurite ores. The rocks are bright blue. Mine one ore or two if you want your own sword. When you have the amount of blurite you want, run out. If you want to do the [[Falador Diary|Falador Achievement Diaries]], mine an extra blurite ore as it is necessary for one of the easy tasks.\n\nIt may be helpful to have a bodyguard to protect you from the aggressive monsters; however, if done correctly, a level 3 player can get the ore. If you die you will retain the ore, however, this obviously doesn't apply to [[Hardcore Ironman]] characters.\n\n''Note that there is a spot where the monsters cannot attack you. It is right next to the entrance to the members-only area of this dungeon. It is recommended that you mine at the blurite ore rock right next to this area, so you can easily retreat to safety if necessary.''\n\n===Creating the sword===\n'''''Items required:''' 2 [[Iron bar]]s, and a [[blurite ore]]. (Or 4 Iron bars, and two blurite ore if you want your own sword). '''Optional''': an additional [[redberry pie]].''\n\nGet back to [[Thurgo]] with your [[blurite ore]]s and your iron bars. He will make you a sword. If you want a sword for yourself, drop it and ask Thurgo for a replacement. Pick up the second sword again.\n\n[[Members]] planning on doing [[The Giant Dwarf]] soon after this quest are recommended to give Thurgo an additional [[redberry pie]] now, to avoid having to do this at a later point during that quest.\n\n===Finishing up===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Blurite sword]] (suggested [[Falador teleport (tablet)|Falador teleport]]).''\n\nGo back to the [[Squire]] and he will take one of your blurite swords. After handing over the sword you will be done with the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Knight's Sword\n|image = [[File:The Knight's Sword reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n* {{SCP|Smithing|12,725}} [[Smithing]] [[experience]]\n*A [[blurite sword]] (if you got [[Thurgo]] to make you an extra one)\n*The ability to smelt [[blurite ore]] into [[blurite bar]]s (members only)\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*When trying to complete the quest while having the [[blurite sword]] equipped, the [[Squire]] would say \"So can you un-equip it and hand it over to me now please?\"\n*The [[Smithing]] experience granted by this quest is so much that, if the player's Smithing level is 1, it will be levelled up to 29 after this quest. If they start at 15 Smithing (to create the iron bars), it will be levelled up to 31.\n*This is the only free-to-play quest that requires a skill above level 1.\n\n{{The Knight's Sword}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Knight's Sword, The}}"

This will bring you directly outside of the room with Tarn.

There is an [[Agility]] shortcut between the town of [[Burgh de Rott]] and the [[Haunted Mine]] area. Climb over the mine cart just south of the [[Zealot]] (featured in the Haunted Mine quest), and enter the haunted mine, then travel north and enter the lair. Upon entering the room, a cutscene will appear showing [[Tarn|Mutant Tarn]] and two [[terror dog statue]]s.\n\n*The entrance is the same cave as the [[Haunted Mine]] quest (west of [[Burgh de Rott]], south of [[Zealot]], Climb-over mine cart, Crawl-down cart tunnel).\n*Once inside the mine, Level 1, go north to the end of the path.\n\n===Reaching the bank===\nThe banker is to the north-east. To get there:\n*When entering the lair, go east past the floor traps, which are indicated by <span style=\"line-height:21px;\">a big X across the floor tile,</span> and attacking monsters to the end of the passage.\n*Follow the path heading north ('''disarm''' the two wall traps by \"searching\" them, the southern one being attached to the western wall, the north one being attached to the eastern wall) the banker carrying a huge backpack at the end of the hall in a little room.\n*It costs 100 [[coins]] each time to use the bank. Some of the undead in the lair drop coins.\n*This is the last place to restock or heal prior to moving on to [[Tarn Razorlor]].\n\n===Getting to Tarn Razorlor===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" captionalign=\"center\" heights=\"180px\">\nTarn's Lair Part 2.png|The U-shaped hallway after the bank.\nTarn's Lair Part 3.png|The room with a giant skeleton in it followed by the room containing three floor traps.\nTarn's Lair Part 4.png|Pass through the inverted-T hallway, deactivate the log trap in the pillar room, and navigate the wall traps.

There are also numerous monsters and passages within the lair. \n\n*'''Note:''' It is recommended that you have [[Auto Retaliate]] '''OFF''' whilst in the lair, because after disabling a wall trap, you don't want to run back across the spikes straight into the trap again.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Trap/Feature\n!Failure result\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Floor trap'''\n|You will be hit 7-8 hitpoints if you run over a floor trap\n|They are fairly obvious, having a big X across the floor tile. Right-click and search floor to disarm the trap. Another simple alternative is to carefully walk around them.\n|-\n|'''Wall trap'''\n|You will be hit 7-10 hitpoints if you run past a wall trap\n|These are harder to see, but generally only occur in narrow passages, so check for them when you are in a narrow passage.\n|-\n|'''[[Hanging log|Log trap]]'''\n|You will be hit 15-20 hitpoints by a log trap, and knocked to a level below.\n|Log traps only occur on jumps to pillars. There is a nearby right-click [[Floor (Tarn's Lair)|\"Search\" floor]] which will disable the log trap near one of the walls. '''NOTE: If you fall at any point after having disabled a log trap, the trap will become active again the next time you attempt to pass it. Disable them every time.'''\n|-\n|'''Receding walls'''\n|You will be pushed by the walls, and knocked to a level below.\n|Occurs sometimes on slim ledges. Wait until the trap moves back into the walls and '''run''' past it.\n|-\n|'''Passage'''\n|N/A\n|Passages lead to new areas in the lair. Following the more ornate doors (especially with water-features) will eventually lead you to Tarn Razorlor.\n|}\n\n# Starting at the [[bank]], go north through the doorway.\n# Follow the U-shaped hall heading westward to the end, and take the south-western-most doorway.\n# You will now be in a trap-less, square room with a single giant [[skeleton]] in it. Go into the square room to the north, which has three floor traps in it, via the northern door, and take the passageway to the west.\n# You will now be in a hallway that looks like an inverted T. Take the passage to the '''NORTH''', and go through the opening on the west side. Don't go all the way west in the inverted T-shaped room, or you'll face more traps and monsters and end up going in a big circle. (There are no traps in the first part of the hall, but the north hall has two; the first one is on the west wall, and the second one is on the east wall.)\n# This puts you in room with a bunch of pillars that you must jump on. Make your way to the west side of the room using the southern pillars, and deactivate the log swing trap by searching the floor. Sometimes, the trap will not deactivate when you search it, thus you should click the floor again, and if the trap has been deactivated, texts will appear saying, \"That flagstone has already been pressed down. You'll need to wait until it reactivates.\" Then, it will be safe to cross. The log swing trap will reset in 10 to 15 seconds, so you must move quickly. Use the second row of pillars from the west to go north.\n# Follow the path to the east (with a wall trap on the south and then north walls), and you will end up in a room with a big hole in the centre. The walls will shoot out from time to time and knock you into the hole if you are standing there. Time your moves to avoid being knocked into the hole. Take the passageway on the east wall. (There's a total of four areas that will knock you to the lower area.)\n# This is another room of pillars you have to jump on to get across; it does a zigzag across the room from the north-west to the south-east. You will be attacked by two level-94 [[skeleton mage]]s as you are crossing this room. They will start attacking you when you reach the second pillar. It is recommended to turn on [[Protect from Magic]] prayer and ignore them. Hurry across, and go down the stairs. Once on the bottom floor, the passageway to the north leads to Tarn's chamber.\n\n===Preparations===\n[[File:Tarn transforms.gif|frame|Tarn looks angry...]]\n*Make sure you check your health, prayer (if you're going to use it) and have your equipment in order to start the fight, as once you enter there will be little time for any preparations. '''Note''': Wearing the salve amulet is not required to start or end this fight.\n*At least 2 [[prayer potions]] and/or 15 pieces of food ([[monkfish]] or better) left is recommended prior to entering Tarn's room.\n\n===Strategies===\n*The fight itself is fairly easy with high level combat stats (60+).\n*He can attack with both melee and magic, but attacks solely with melee if approached. Since the [[terror dog]]s can only use melee, [[Protect from Melee]] is strongly recommended.\n*[[Tarn Razorlor]] is the only monster required to be killed, so ignoring the minions and turning off Auto Retaliate is recommended.\n*Prayer is drained constantly, regardless of the use of prayers. Make sure you keep an eye on it.\n*During the fight with Tarn Razorlor, you can manoeuvre the terror dogs behind Tarn allowing you to only be attacked by Tarn himself, therefore eliminating the terror dogs from the fight completely.\n\n===Fighting Tarn Razorlor===\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Fighting Tarn.png|thumb|Fighting mutant Tarn.]]\n{{Listen\n|title = [[Tarn Razorlor (music track)|Tarn Razorlor]]\n|desc = The music which plays while fighting Tarn.\n|filename = Tarn Razorlor.ogg\n}}\nThere is a prayer drain effect during this fight, so make sure that you're stocked up on prayer potions before entering, as you'll lose your prayer even if [[Prayer Flicking|prayer-flicking]].\n*A cut scene of [[Tarn]] transforming into a green mutant with lashing tentacles and unleashing two level-110 [[terror dog]]s appears upon entering the room. After this cut scene, the fight will begin. [[Animated steel armour (Tarn's Lair)|Animated steel armour]] (level 53) will also attack if moved near them.\n*As soon as the cut scene ends, turn on [[Protect from Melee]] and attack [[Tarn]], who is level 69 Combat. Be sure to turn on prayer before eating as well, as there seems to be a delay before you can consume food.\n*If you poison him in mutant form, the poison will carry over to his ghost form.\n*After his first form is defeated, he will turn into a ghost, but this form is easier to defeat.\n*As soon as [[Tarn]] is defeated, the northern door will open up. Go inside.\n**Neither the Animated Armours nor the Terror Dogs will despawn or de-aggro once Tarn is defeated, though doing the next step seems to \"reset\" the room's instance.\n*[[Tarn's diary]] is in this next room on a table. Read through it to complete the miniquest.\n*You can use the diary with a [[salve amulet]] to create a [[salve amulet (e)]]. This does not need to be done in the boss room, and you can enchant multiple salve amulets.\n'''Note: '''Kill a [[terror dog]] while you are here to complete a [[Medium Morytania Diary|Medium Morytania]] task.\n\n==Rewards==\n*{{SCP|Slayer|5,000}} [[Slayer]] experience (only if not in Deadman Mode) {{CiteReddit|author=Mod Light|url=https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/pb735r/deadman_reborn_megathread/hbfhr9j/|title=Deadman Reborn Megathread|quote=I've heard from Husky this is intentional as it's an instance and xp gain is disabled in instances in Deadman.|date=3 September 2021|archiveurl=https://archive.is/8tcib|archivedate=8 September 2021}}\n*[[Tarn's diary]]\n*[[Salve amulet (e)]] [[File:Salve amulet (e).png]] (20% [[Attack]] and [[Strength]] bonuses against the [[undead]])\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Lair of Tarn Razorlor is required for the following:\n*[[Morytania Diary|Medium Morytania diary]] (kill a [[terror dog]])\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|miniquest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*If you do not have level 40 Slayer, you can traverse most of Tarn's Lair, but you cannot enter Tarn's room.

Here, you will find [[Grubfoot]], who tells you that he wants to enter Dorgesh-Kaan to speak to [[Zanik]], who he refers to as the Chosen Commander, as he had a dream about her that he needs to discuss with her.\n[[File:Land of the Goblins - Grubfoot's dream.png|thumb|280px|Grubfoot's vision of Yu'biusk, the Land of the Goblins.]]\nHowever, [[Mistag]] says that though the [[Dorgeshuun Council]] agreed to allow humans into the city, their laws currently don't allow surface goblins entry. Though the Council wishes to establish relations with them, they have heard the surface goblins are a very warlike people, and most believe letting them into the city is too much of a risk. You will tell Mistag that you will take responsibility for Grubfoot, and enter the city.\n\nTake Grubfoot to [[Zanik]], who can be found in [[Oldak]]'s workshop in the north-west corner of the city. He will tell you and Zanik about his dream of [[Yu'biusk]], the Land of the Goblins, where goblins of all tribes live together in peace in a lush land. He believes that Zanik, the Chosen Commander, is the one who is prophesied to save the goblins by leading them back to Yu'biusk.\n\nGrubfoot will then tell you of a hidden temple of the [[Big High War God]], where the priests within may know the means to reach Yu'biusk. After promising to keep the location of the temple a secret, he'll tell you the entrance is found in a muddy cave near a \"place where many humans catch fish\". Oldak will recognise that he is referring to the [[Goblin Cave]], and will use a teleportation sphere to take you and Zanik there.\n\n===Impostor Among Goblins===\n{{Needed|recommended=[[Dorgesh-kaan sphere]], [[skills necklace]]}}\n\nUpon arrival, head north-west until you reach the entrance to the temple, guarded by two [[Goblin guard (Land of the Goblins)|goblin guards]]. If you haven't obtained [[black dye]] already, pick the [[black mushrooms]] nearby for later use.\n[[File:Land of the Goblins - temple entrance.png|thumb|280px|The entrance to the Goblin Temple, guarded by two goblins.]]\nSpeak to the goblin guards, who will allow [[Zanik]] to enter the [[Goblin Temple]]. However, as you are a human, they will deny you entry. Return to [[Oldak]] in [[Dorgesh-Kaan]] and tell him about your predicament, and he will refer you to the [[Makeover Mage]], who may be able to help you. (Talking to Oldak is not required to progress.)\n\nMake your way to the Makeover Mage, who can be found north of the [[Crafting Guild]] (easily reached via [[skills necklace]]), and ask them about turning yourself into a goblin. Though they don't want to perform the procedure for you, wanting to avoid being responsible should something go wrong, they will tell you the recipe to create the [[goblin potion]], which are [[toadflax]] and [[pharmakos berries]], found on bushes just outside the building. They'll also tell you that the potion has several restrictions that if not adhered to will result in the transmogrification being reversed, which include standing in direct sunlight, entering combat, and wearing any items that is not a [[goblin mail]]. (It can be beneficial if doing [[Hopespear's Will]] to make two potions, allowing for you to kill the weaker priests and then re-gear for the last.)\n\n===The Temple of Tribes===\n{{Needed|[[Toadflax potion (unf)]], [[pharmakos berries]], [[goblin mail]], [[black dye]], don't bring any armour for this part because you will need to unequip it}}\n\nIf you picked a [[black mushroom]] earlier, use it on a [[pestle and mortar]] whilst having an empty [[vial]] in your inventory to create [[black dye]], as you'll need it for this part of the quest. Otherwise, bring the vial and pestle and mortar with you when you return to the Goblin Cave. In addition, if you have a [[pet]] following you, deposit it at a bank or store it in your [[POH]] [[menagerie]] as you will not be able to enter the temple otherwise.\n[[File:Drinking goblin potion.gif|frame|The player transforms into a goblin.]]\nOnce you create the [[goblin potion]], make your way back to the [[Goblin Cave]]. You can use the [[Fishing Guild]] teleport on the [[skills necklace]] to reach the cave entrance.\n\nDrink the goblin potion, and you will be prompted to choose how you'll appear as a goblin. Speak to the [[Goblin guard (Land of the Goblins)|goblin guards]] again, who will try guessing your [[goblin name]]; if you like the name they've guessed, tell them they've guessed correctly, otherwise keep telling them to guess again. Afterwards you'll be granted entry to the [[Goblin Temple]]. '''Once inside, if you haven't obtained a goblin mail already, search the crates by the exit for one.'''\n\n'''Note:''' if you at any point need to teleport out while in goblin form, make sure to not be wearing your dyed goblin mail with a full inventory or the armour will be '''permanently destroyed'''.\n\nInside the temple, speak to [[High Priest Bighead]] in the north of the temple, who will tell you that [[Zanik]] has been imprisoned for her antitheist views by the [[Huzamogaarb]] tribe. Use your [[black dye]] on a [[goblin mail]] to create a [[black goblin mail]], then wear it and enter the Huzamogaarb tribal room, found in the north-eastern part of the temple. Speak to Zanik, who will tell you that her [[Dorgesh-kaan sphere]] was confiscated and placed in a crate across the room. Search the crate to receive the sphere and return it to Zanik, who will use it and escape. If you speak to Zanik with a Dorgesh-Kaan sphere already in your inventory, she will take it; you can still search the crate to retrieve a spare.\n\nReturn to High Priest Bighead, and ask him about [[Yu'biusk]]. He will tell you that knowledge is not for ordinary goblins, and only those who understand the ways of the [[Big High War God]] may learn of it. The High Priest will test your knowledge about the Big High War God, and you must answer four questions with the correct replies to proceed, as seen below:\n* True or false: those who do not believe in Big High War God, whether they goblins or other races, must die.\n** True.\n** Big High War God commands it.\n* True or false: Big High War God chose goblins to be his race because goblins mighty warriors.\n** False.\n** Goblins not mighty warriors before he chose us.\n* True or false: goblin leaders should be good at planning in order to win battles.\n** False.\n** That one of the commandments.\n* Prophecy say some day Big High War God send Chosen Commander. What Chosen Commander do?\n** Lead goblins to victory over whole world.\n\n===Keys to the Crypt===\n{{Needed|[[Fishing rod]], [[raw slimy eel]], 5 [[coins]], [[blue dye]], [[orange dye]], [[purple dye]], [[yellow dye]], [[black goblin mail]], [[goblin potion]], [[combat]] equipment for the next section|recommended=Two teleports to Draynor Village}}\n\nAfter passing the test, the High Priest will answer your questions. Ask him about Yu'biusk, and ask of its whereabouts. He will say he does not know, but his predecessor [[Snothead]] might. However, he is buried in the temple crypt, which only the High Priest can enter with the six keys of the six tribal priests. You can also ask other questions, such as the Big High War God's true name, and the reason why there are only six tribes in the temple when there were originally twelve. ''If the pickpocket option doesn't show up on the six Priests, talk to the High Priest again until he mentions the six keys. The option to pickpocket becomes available when you select \"can i talk to old high priests\"''\n\n[[File:Goblin Temple.png|thumb|280px|The Goblin Temple, dedicated to the Big High War God.]]\nTo access the temple crypt, you'll need to steal the keys from each of the tribal priests. As you're already wearing the black goblin mail, enter the Huzamogaarb tribal room and pickpocket the [[Priest (Goblin)|priest]] for the [[Huzamogaarb key]]. You will then need to dye your goblin mail to match each of the remaining tribes in order to gain access to their rooms. You will now need to leave the cave to bleach your armour white, and collect the other dyes if you don't already have them.\n\nMake your way to [[Aggie]] in [[Draynor Village]] and ask if she can make dyes for you, and then about the black and white dyes. She says that she will need 5 coins and a [[whitefish]], which are caught only at [[Hemenster]] with [[raw slimy eel]] as bait. Go to the [[Fishing Contest]] area west of the [[Ranging Guild]]. Upon arrival, click on the gate and tell [[Morris]] that you need to catch a whitefish. Once you've caught one, return to Aggie and she'll give you a [[white goblin mail]]. ''Note that you cannot do this before speaking to Aggie''.\n\nTake the dyes, the white goblin mail, the Huzamogaarb key, and some combat gear to the cavern. Unequip everything, and take another sip of your goblin potion to enter the temple.   Pass the guard in the doorway of Saragorgak tribe in the west side of the temple, pickpocket the tribe's priest, and then pass the guard again to leave.\n\nDye your goblin mail and pickpocket the remaining keys correspondingly:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Tribe\n!Corner\n!Colour\n!Key\n|-\n|[[Saragorgak]]\n|West\n|{{plink|White goblin mail|txt=White}}\n|{{plink|Saragorgak key}}\n|-\n|[[Yurkolgokh]]\n|North-west\n|{{plink|Yellow goblin mail|txt=Yellow}}\n|{{plink|Yurkolgokh key}}\n|-\n|[[Huzamogaarb]]\n|North-east\n|{{plink|Black goblin mail|txt=Black}}\n|{{plink|Huzamogaarb key}}\n|-\n|[[Ekeleshuun]]\n|East\n|{{plink|Blue goblin mail|txt=Blue}}\n|{{plink|Ekeleshuun key}}\n|-\n|[[Narogoshuun]]\n|South-east\n|{{plink|Orange goblin mail|txt=Orange}}\n|{{plink|Narogoshuun key}}\n|-\n|[[Horogothgar]]\n|South-west\n|{{plink|Purple goblin mail|txt=Purple}}\n|{{plink|Horogothgar key}}\n|}\n\n===High Priests of Ages Past===\nOnce obtaining  all 6 keys and using them on the door, they will be removed from your inventory and the door will be open from then on without the use of the keys again.\n\nNow you can enter the crypt - the big door in the north. Once inside, prepare for battle by equipping weapons and armour; you will change from goblin to human when you do this. Go to the first grave to the left, and say the name of the high priest, [[Snothead]]. He will rise from the ground and proceed to attack.\n\nAfter defeating Snothead, ask about Yu'biusk's whereabouts. Though he does not know, he believes his ancestor knows. Ask for his name, and he'll tell you it is [[Snailfeet]]. Continue with this pattern until you have beaten the remaining high priests. The further back in time you go, you'll realise that the older high priests have a more expansive knowledge of Yu'biusk, speak more eloquently than their successors, and are also more adept at fighting.\n\nAfter defeating the last priest, [[Strongbones]], he will tell you that Yu'biusk is another plane of existence, not a place on Gielinor.\n\n'''Note:''' Redeyes and Strongbones can deal high amounts of damage, players should be prepared. If needed, players can leave the crypt between fights to bank, but doing so requires turning into a goblin to gain access to the temple and therefore crypt again. \n\nAll of the high priests that attack with Ranged/Magic can be somewhat safe-spotted. As long as you stay a few tiles away, they will default to their Ranged/Magic attack and you can use protection prayers. Redeyes and Mosschin both attack with magic, even though their attack animation is with a bow. You might want to attack [[Strongbones]] with strong armour praying against Magic so that you're fairly protected against both the reanimated skeletons and the boss's melee and Ranged attacks.\n\nIf the player dies during the fight, their gravestone will appear in the cave outside the temple entrance  - obtaining a new goblin potion and goblin mail is '''not''' required to retrieve their items.\n[[File:Land of the Goblins - fighting Strongbones.png|thumb|280px|The player fights Strongbones, the strongest high priest in the crypt.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Image\n!Priest Name\n!Level\n!Grave location\n!Attack Style\n|-\n|[[File:Snothead chathead.png|center]]\n|[[Snothead]]\n|32\n|South-west\n|Melee\n|-\n|[[File:Snailfeet chathead.png|center]]\n|[[Snailfeet]]\n|56\n|South-east\n|Melee and Ranged\n|-\n|[[File:Mosschin chathead.png|center]]\n|[[Mosschin]]\n|88\n|North-west\n|Melee, and Magic\n|-\n|[[File:Redeyes chathead.png|center]]\n|[[Redeyes]]\n|121\n|North-east\n|Melee, and Magic (Lowers Attack, Strength and Defence)\n|-\n|[[File:Strongbones chathead.png|center]]\n|[[Strongbones]]\n|184\n|North\n|Melee, Magic, and Ranged.

Oldak will tell you that they've found a [[fairy ring|fungus ring]] in the [[Dorgesh-Kaan South Dungeon|southern caves]] with similar properties to [[law rune]]s, and believes that with enough power and Zanik's presence, it should be able to open a portal to Yu'biusk.\n\nIf players have access to the [[fairy rings]], use the code {{Fairycode|AJQ}} to teleport there. Otherwise, to get there, travel south on the same floor level as Oldak's workshop, go up the stairs at the end and then up again to reach the [[Dorgesh-Kaan Agility Course|agility course]]. Climb down the ladder at the west side of the agility course platform, walk a bit south and take the first corridor to the east. At the end of the corridor, head south and look west for the [[File:Transportation icon.png]] icon at the southern entrance of the {{FloorNumber|uk=2}}.\n\nMeet up with Zanik and Oldak, who will ask you to adjust the machine by allocating power to each ring proportional to the area within the ring. The rings, from outer to inner, have a radius of 3, 2 and 1. Because a circle's area is proportional to the square of its radius, this means the power given to each of the circles should be 9, 4, and 1.\n\n[[File:Fairy ring power relay.png|right|thumb|280px|The interface used to allocate power to each of the circles in the [[fairy ring]].]]\n\nEnter the values 9-4-1 and activate the machine to start a cutscene where the three of you will be teleported to [[Yu'biusk]]. Upon arriving, you see that it is a barren wasteland, torn asunder by [[Bandos]] after the [[God Wars]] in a fit of rage. Walk north-west until you get to some short walls surrounding a [[Strange box (Yu'biusk)|strange box]]. Oldak will warn you that you need to return fast, but keep walking. Zanik will notice the box and ask you to help her open it.\n\nOpen the strange box, and Zanik will be sucked into it. As this happens, Oldak tells you that you and him have to leave, as the portal is closing. Upon returning to Gielinor, Oldak will tell you that he hasn't been able to get the fairy ring-hacking machine working again, and suggests that there may be a way to reach Yu'biusk after breaching the planar barriers between it and Gielinor.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nLand of the Goblins - arriving in Yu'biusk.png|The player, Zanik, and Oldak arrive in Yu'biusk, only to find it is not as Grubfoot described.\nLand of the Goblins - dreams shattered.png|A strange box is found, being the only intact object you can see in this place.\nLand of the Goblins - opening the strange box.gif|The player and Zanik open the box, and Zanik is sucked into it.\n</gallery>\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Land of the Goblins\n|image = \n|qp = 2\n|rewards =\n* {{SCP|Agility|8,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n* {{SCP|Fishing|8,000}} [[Fishing]] experience\n* {{SCP|Thieving|8,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n* {{SCP|Herblore|8,000}} [[Herblore]] experience\n* Access to the [[Goblin Temple]] (with an [[altar]] to recharge prayer points).\n* Access to [[Yu'biusk]], using [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|BLQ}}.\n* Ability to purchase [[plain of mud sphere]]s that transports you to the [[Goblin Cave]].\n* Ability to make [[goblin potion]]s.\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Land of the Goblins is required for the following:\n* [[Hopespear's Will]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Unlock details\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Music track\n|-\n|[[Zanik's Theme]]\n|Unlocked during the cutscene showing [[Grubfoot]]'s dream\n|[[File:Zanik's Theme.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Temple of Tribes]]\n|Unlocked upon entering the [[Goblin Temple]]\n|[[File:Temple of Tribes.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Catacombs and Tombs]]\n|Unlocked upon entering the Goblin Temple crypt\n|[[File:Catacombs and Tombs.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Dusk in Yu'biusk]]\n|Unlocked upon arriving in [[Yu'biusk]]\n|[[File:Dusk in Yu'biusk.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Don't Panic Zanik]]\n|Unlocked after Zanik disappears into the strange box\n|[[File:Don't Panic Zanik.ogg]]\n|}\n\n==Historical==\nLand of the Goblins was originally released in ''RuneScape'' on [[12 November]] [[2007]], three months after the [[August 2007 Archive of RuneScape]] that ''Old School'' was built off of. Like other content from the immediate post-backup era (such as [[God Wars Dungeon]] and the [[Ourania Altar]]), it was present in the Archive's files but had not yet been added to the live game.\n\nIn December 2021, a Developer's Blog was written which revealed that the majority of the work for the quest was already completed and offered players the opportunity to introduce it to the game via a [[Poll:Tombs of Amascut, Quests & GIM Improvements|poll]].\n\n===Differences from original version===\nAlthough largely identical to the original Land of the Goblins, there are a few differences in the Old School edition:\n\n* As is the case with almost all Old School-exclusive quests, the player is prompted on whether they want to begin the quest with a chatbox option when speaking to Grubfoot and Mistag. The original quest automatically started after the player agreed to vouch for Grubfoot.\n* The original quest awarded 3,000 Agility, Herblore, Thieving, Fishing, and Strength XP along with 2,000 Prayer XP. In Old School RuneScape, the quest instead awards 8,000 Agility, Herblore, Fishing, and Thieving XP.\n* The quest completion icon is an image of the [[Goblin potion]]; Zanik's face is displayed on the original reward scroll.\n* The original only awarded one quest point; two are awarded in Old School.\n* There are minor changes to dialogue throughout, including the removal of dialogue choices at several points throughout the quest.\n* In the original, Pharmarkos berries were just given to you by the [[Makeover Mage]], instead of being harvested from bushes. The item also originally had a unique model, instead of being a recoloured version of [[dwellberries]].\n* [[High Priest Bighead]] was known as simply \"High Priest\" in the original version, and was seated on a small pew between some candles.

Other questline continuations have been unique quests developed exclusively for ''Old School'' (e.g. [[A Taste of Hope]] and [[Song of the Elves]]). This is because the quest was already nearly complete in the archives that the ''Old School'' team had access to. \n* The goblin high priests become more articulate and well-spoken as the player progresses through them, with [[Redeyes]] and [[Strongbones]] speaking in the same dialect as a human. This implies that surface goblins were once more educated and civilized than they are today.\n* In the Goblin Temple, the Narogoshuun priest says, \"I tell you truth! There some goblins here who not die before they see Chosen Commander coming with glory of Big High War God!\" It's very likely that this is a reference to Matthew 16:28 in the Bible, with the King James Version quoting Christ as saying to his disciples, \"Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.\"\n* The Horogothgar priest tells a story about Hopespear cursing a number of goblin children who came to make fun of him in his old age, whereupon monsters came and tore the children to pieces. This is likely also a reference to the Bible, namely 2 Kings 23-24, in the King James Version: \"And he (Elisha) went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.\"\n\n{{Land of the Goblins}}\n[[Category:Backported and extracted content]]"

If they think you're worthy, they'll send you through the gates to talk to Sir [[Radimus Erkle]] to get your assignment. He will give you an incomplete map of the [[Kharazi Jungle]], which you're to complete, and tell you to make friends with the inhabitants of the jungle so they'll give you a totem pole to proudly display inside the guild.\n\nBefore you leave, take 3-5 [[papyrus]] off the table, and grab a [[machete]] from the [[Cupboard (Legends' Quest)|cupboard]]. You can buy them from the [[Obli's General Store|general store]] in [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] too, but these are free.\n\n===Transport and banking===\nYou will need to bank several times during the quest. Depending on stats and risk tolerance, it may be possible to complete more steps in a single trip, so read ahead to see what will be required.\n\nIf you have unlocked [[fairy rings]], the shortest way to the jungle is code {{Fairycode|ckr}}. When you need to bank, teleport out of the jungle and return using the fairy ring. Wearing a charged [[amulet of glory]] or [[ring of wealth]] throughout the quest provides a convenient teleport close to a bank and fairy ring ([[Edgeville]] and the [[Grand Exchange]] respectively). It may be worth taking the alternative route to Shilo Village on the first trip, to buy charcoal and papyrus.\n\nIf not using the fairy rings, make your way to [[Brimhaven]] by taking a boat from [[Ardougne]] or any [[charter ship]]. Then, you can take [[Shilo Village cart system|Hajedy's cart]] to [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] (his fee is 200 [[coins]]). Later, you can exit the jungle the same way as entering it, and return to Shilo Village to use the bank.\n\nIt will be necessary to exit from the depths of the [[Viyeldi caves]], twice for the short path and three times for the long path. Even for players travelling by cart, teleporting out will be faster than climbing out. If climbing out, you can fail at some obstacles, particularly the strength door (where your attempts to open it from the inside can be interrupted by attacks from [[death wing]]s). Teleporting out also provides an opportunity to bank before continuing.\n\n==Mapping the jungle==\n'''''Items required:''' [[Radimus notes]] (he will replace at the [[Legends' Guild]] for 30gp), [[axe]], [[machete]], at least 1 [[charcoal]] (3 to be safe), at least 3 [[papyrus]] (5 to be safe).''\n\n'''''Skills required:''''' {{SCP|Crafting|50|link=yes}} ''to map the [[jungle]].''\n\n:'''Note:''' You do not need 50 [[Woodcutting]] to enter the jungle. However, you do need 50 Woodcutting to cut down the Yommi Tree at the end of the quest.\n\n[[File:Legends' Quest - Thick jungle.png|thumb|220px|The jungle is very dense.]]\nHead to the jungle boundary south of Shilo Village. To get into the Kharazi Jungle, you'll need to cut your way through the overgrown jungle vegetation using an axe and machete.\n\nOnce inside (preferably on the eastern/western sides, so you don't have to run back and forth), start mapping down the jungle with your charcoal and papyrus by right-clicking on the Radimus notes and then selecting 'Complete'. Sometimes the charcoal and/or papyrus can break, so you should bring extra just in case. Alternatively, you may mess up the papyrus, but be able to salvage it. You should watch out for the [[jungle wolf|jungle wolves]], as they are aggressive; the [[Tormented Warrior|tormented warriors]] and oomlie birds aren't aggressive unless provoked (see below).\n\n{{UIMnote|You can drop your charcoal and papyrus after completing the notes all three times.}}\n\n===Extra tasks===\n*If you intend on freeing [[Sir Amik Varze]] in [[Recipe for Disaster]], you should grab [[Vanilla pod|vanilla pod(s)]] whilst you are here—they are located directly south-west from the [[Water Pool]] near the beach in a group of five plants.\n*Shake a [[leafy palm tree]] to acquire a [[palm leaf]]. Pick up five palm leaves (or pick up and drop the same one five times) to complete a hard task for the [[Karamja Diary]].\n*Additionally, kill an [[oomlie bird]] and collect its [[Raw oomlie|meat]]. Use a palm leaf on the raw meat, then cook the resulting [[wrapped oomlie]] over [[fire]] (now or later) and eat the resulting [[oomlie wrap]] to complete another hard task.\n*Chop some [[teak]] and [[mahogany]] trees at the pool or southern coastal end (teak) and south-east (mahogany) of the jungle to complete two medium tasks rather than paying 100 [[trading sticks]] to enter the [[Hardwood Grove]].\n\n==Contacting the locals==\n'''''Items required:''' [[Radimus notes]], [[axe]], [[machete]], 4 free inventory slots.''\n\n'''''Skills required:''''' {{SCP|Agility|50|link=yes}}.\n\nConsider banking here to get the items for the '''Binding book''' section.\n\nTalk to one of the [[jungle forester]]s, who are standing at various points along the outside of the jungle boundary. They have a [[bullroarer]], which they'll be willing to give up if you give them a copy of your notes. Use the completed Radimus notes on the forester, who will then make a copy before giving you their bullroarer.\n\n:'''{{Colour|red|Warning:}}''' Do not use the bullroarer around [[Tormented Warrior|tormented warriors]] or oomlie birds, or you'll be attacked!\n\n{{Map|align=right|mtype=pin|2793,2908|2855,2916|2872,2909|2919,2920|2952,2898|caption='Totem Pole' Locations in Jungle.}}\nGo inside the jungle again, and swing it near the totem pole found east of the water pool represented by a blue square on the map to call a local named [[Gujuo]] out of hiding. '''(There are multiple totem poles in the jungle, so if nothing happens, try another one.)''' He'll ask for your help, since his tribe's shaman, [[Ungadulu]], is trapped in his [[Shaman Caves|cave]].\n{{Map|2782,2935|r=5|mtype=square|align=left|caption=The location of the cave.}}\nFrom now on, you can call Gujuo using the bullroarer from anywhere in the jungle. Towards the north-western edge of the jungle, you'll find some [[Mossy rock|rocks]] that you can squeeze through to get into the cave.\n\nInvestigate (right-click) the [[Fire Wall]] and talk to [[Ungadulu]], who warns you not to approach the flames, but becomes possessed and informs you that only pure water can extinguish the flames. Next, search the various items; the [[Bed (Viyeldi caves)|bed]], [[Table (Viyeldi caves)|table]], and [[Crate (Viyeldi caves)|crate]] to obtain Ungadulu's notes: a [[scrawled note]] from the crate; [[a scribbled note]] on the table; and a [[scrumpled note]] on the bed. Reading them tells you how the shaman had prepared to summon his ancestors and pay homage to them, but fell prey to an evil presence in the cave.\n\nOnce you're back outside again, call [[Gujuo]] with your [[bullroarer]]. Ask the shaman for more information and tell him you need some pure water to douse some magic flames (option 4). Ask, \"What kind of a vessel?\" (option 5). He'll give you a [[sketch]] of the vessel. (If you do not have these dialogue options, go back inside the cave and speak to [[Ungadulu]] again after you read the notes and they should become available).\n\n[[File:Legends' Quest - Viyeldi caves entrance.png|thumb|right|220px|The entrance to the cave.]]\n\n{{Map:Viyeldi caves}}\n\n==Binding book==\n'''''Items required:'''''\n* ''[[Radimus notes]], [[axe]], [[machete]], [[pickaxe]], 1-2 [[lockpick]]s (2 to be safe).''\n* ''\"SMELL\" runes: 1 [[soul rune]], 1 [[mind rune]], 1 [[earth rune]], 2 [[law runes]].''\n* ''Cut [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], [[ruby]], [[diamond]], [[red topaz]], [[jade]], and [[opal]].''\n\n'''''Recommended: '''''\n* ''Supplies to pass level 83 [[Death Wing]]s, and equipment to kill one for the [[Karamja Diary]] if you wish to do it on this trip. (The second trip may be more convenient, as you will need combat equipment anyway.)''\n* ''A [[Super restore|super restore potion]] if your level is not far above the required level stated below.''\n\n'''''Skills required:''''' {{SCP|Agility|50|link=yes}} ''to squeeze through the crevice,'' {{SCP|Thieving|50|link=yes}} ''to pick the locked door,'' {{SCP|Mining|52|link=yes}} ''to smash the [[Boulder (Shaman Caves)|boulders]] (if you're boosting mining, bring 2-3 Dwarven Stouts(m)),'' {{SCP|Strength|50|link=yes}} ''to force the heavy door.''\n\n'''Make sure that you have all the required items.''' Go back to the cave. Ignore the fire wall and head to the east side of the room. Squeeze through a crevice hidden behind the [[Bookcase (Shaman Caves)|easternmost bookcase]] by searching it.\n\nAs you proceed further into the cave, you will come across an [[Ancient Gate]]. This is where your [[lockpick]] comes into play. Attempt to pick the lock; if you fail, you may lose your lockpick. However, as there is a message before the lockpick breaks, you can easily circumvent it by clicking elsewhere, which will save your lockpick.\n\nOnce past this door, you'll need a [[pickaxe]] to mine three [[Boulder (Shaman Caves)|boulders]] out of the way. If you fail, your [[Mining]] level will decrease by 1. Once past these three boulders, use brute force to open the next set of [[Ancient Gate#Second gate|gates]]; failing this will result in your [[Strength]] being lowered. Beware of level 83 [[Death Wing]]s on the other side; activating [[Protect from Melee|Protect From Melee]] can completely negate their damage. Killing a Death Wing, either now or on the second visit, will complete a hard task in the [[Karamja Diary]].\n\nRun farther into the cave, and jump over the [[jagged wall]]. When you get further inside, you'll find a place where there are [[Marked wall|markings on the wall]]. Read them and it will give you the riddle:\n:''\"Place five stones of magical power - but place them wrong, and your fate will sour. First is the spirit of man or beast (Soul rune), second the place where fools tread least (Mind rune). Third is the soil where plants do grow (Earth Rune) -- and four and five are the rules you must know (Two Law Runes). Solve this riddle, and overcome your ignorance; arranged correct, it should make sense.\"''\n\n[[File:Gems locations.png|thumb|223x223px|Gems location for puzzle]]\nIt spells SMELL. Use the runes with the wall in the order of Soul, Mind, Earth, Law, Law and then the door will appear. If the runes are used in an incorrect order, you will have leave and re-enter the cave. \n[[File:Legends' Quest - Binding book.png|thumb|220px|Retrieving the binding book]]\nInside, you'll face your next puzzle, where you'll see a number of [[Carved rock]]s sitting in pools of water. Fit your [[gems]] into each one by referring to the map at the beginning of this section. When all of them are in, there will be a little light show, and the [[binding book]] will appear. Take the book. (One useful feature of this book is that you can bless [[vials]] and fill them with pure water from your bowl to make [[holy water]]. Wielding these while fighting [[demons]] damages them.)\n\nOnce you have the binding book, you can leave the cave (recommended to teleport out).\n\n'''Note:''' If you lose the binding book, you must repeat the steps above in order to reclaim it! However, the \"SMELL\" runes are not needed a second time.\n\n==Gold bowl==\n'''''Items required:''' [[Sketch]], [[hammer]], 2-6 [[gold bar]]s ({{Ironman}}'' ''if you're planning on gathering magic logs from the yommi tree using the yommi tree sapling method described later, you do not need to make additional gold bowls).''\n\n'''''Skills required:''''' {{SCP|Smithing|50|link=yes}}.\n\nGo to any [[anvil]] while holding the sketch of the vessel you obtained from Gujuo and try to make the [[gold bowl]]. You may fail, so to be safe, bring more than two bars. If walking, the closest anvil is in [[Tai Bwo Wannai Village]]. If you can use fairy rings and have 60 smithing, you can use the minigame teleport to [[Blast Furnace]] for an anvil, take a mine cart back to the [[Grand Exchange]], then use the fairy ring there to return to the jungle.\n\n{{UIMnote|You can now drop your Sketch after successfully making a Gold bowl.}}\n\n==Pure water==\n'''''Items required:''' [[Radimus notes]], [[axe]], [[machete]], [[bullroarer]], [[gold bowl]], [[prayer potion]] (if you fail to bless the bowl and your prayer drops below 42).''\n\n'''''Skills required:''''' {{SCP|Prayer|42|link=yes}} ''to bless the bowl (if boosting Prayer, make sure to use your [[ancient mace]] special attack on a [[PoH]] [[max hit dummy]] before this).''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' Bring the items for '''Freeing Ungadulu'''.''\n\nHead back into the jungle and call [[Gujuo]]. He'll help you bless your gold bowl so that it can carry the pure water. Your [[prayer points]] must be ''at or above'' 42 to attempt this, and if you fail, it will drain 5 prayer points. If it drains your prayer below 42, you'll have to restore it to try again.\n\nTo bless multiple bowls, talk to Gujuo again (without saying \"thanks for your help\").\n\nWith your [[blessed golden bowl]], head to the pool of pure water towards the middle of the jungle. Since you can't quite reach the water, cut a [[hollow reed]] by using your [[machete]] on the tall reeds by the edge of the pool, then use the reed on the pool to siphon the water into your bowl. If you left-click the reeds, you will receive a message saying you need a knife to cut them, but a machete works just as well. Note that if you leave the jungle, the water in your bowl may evaporate, requiring you to refill the bowl again when you return.\n\n==Freeing Ungadulu==\n'''''Items required:''' [[Radimus notes]], [[axe]], pickaxe, [[machete]], [[bullroarer]], [[binding book]], [[blessed gold bowl]] filled with pure water.''\n\n'''''Skills required:''''' {{SCP|Agility|50|link=yes}} ''to enter the cave,'' {{SCP|Woodcutting|50|link=yes}} ''for the [[yommi tree seeds]].''\n\n'''''Recommended'': '''''[[Combat]] [[equipment]], [[food]] and several [[prayer potion]]s.''\n\n[[File:Legends' Quest - Fighting Nezikchened.png|thumb|220px|Nezikchened, the demon possessing Ungadulu.]]\nThere is an upcoming fight, so be prepared. '''''If you die during the fight, you will have to re-obtain all quest items.'''''  When you're ready, use your pure water on the fire wall to step through without damage. Then, use your [[binding book]] on [[Ungadulu]] to release the demon, [[Nezikchened]]. Do not talk to or attack Ungadulu. (If you talk to him, he will damage you. If you attack him, he will damage you and knock you out of the octogram.)\n\nNezikchened is level 187 and will drain a large amount of [[prayer]] (90%) at the beginning of the battle, but never again after that, so be careful if you want to use it while fighting him. Additionally, he'll cast a [[Fire Blast]] just before dying, so make sure to keep your [[HP]] up so that he doesn't kill you with his last ditch attack. '''This Fire Blast will hit through the [[Protect from Magic]] prayer.'''\n\n[[Arclight]] is heavily recommended for its damage and accuracy boost, as well as its stat-lowering special attack versus demons. If unavailable, other [[demonbane weapons]] (eg. [[Silverlight]], [[Darklight]], [[Holy water|Holy Water]]) may be used alongside a higher-tier weapon. The [[Desk (Viyeldi caves)|desk]] can be used as a [[safespot]], resulting in Nezikchened switching to [[Magic]] attacks.\n\n:'''Note:''' There seems to be a glitch where if there is more than one person in the room (not inside the octagram), Nezikchened may go [[aggressive]] on the other player. This then makes Nezikchened completely harmless and unable to attack the player.\n:'''Note:''' If you don't kill [[Nezikchened]] fast enough, he will reset, causing you to have to use the book on Ungadulu again. The combat will reset, restoring him to full [[health]] and re-draining your [[prayer]].\n\nOnce Nezikchened is defeated, talk to Ungadulu. Ungadulu will thank you and give you some [[yommi tree seeds]]. '''Be careful not to attack him as this will knock you out of the octogram and deal some damage, and if your health is low after the fight, this may kill you.''' You can use the [[drop trick]] to get more yommi tree seeds, to save time later if you lose the plants to rotting or if you are an [[Ironman]] and want to get [[magic logs]]. Ask Ungadulu how to get out, and he will tell you that he cast a spell to protect you from the flames. You can now walk through the flames at any time without the bowl.\n\n{{UIMnote|You can now drop the Binding Book.}}\n\nExit the cave, head back to the pure water pool, and refill your bowl with water if needed. Then, use it on the [[yommi tree seeds]] to germinate them. (Doing this will empty all your bowls if you had more than one, and you cannot plant the seed without more pure water.) After germinating the seeds, attempt to refill your bowl again to discover the pool is now gross with sludge. We will need to cleanse the pool during the next section before we can plant the seeds. (You must use a hollow reed on the pool to get the next dialogue from Gujuo.) \n\nCall [[Gujuo]]. He will tell you that the underground source has probably been blocked off, and you'll need a [[bravery potion]] to be able to make it through the dark tunnel.\n\n==Bravery potion==\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ardrigal]], [[snake weed]], [[vial of water]].\n\n{{Map|align=right|mtype=pin|caption=The locations of the herbs for the bravery potion.\n|2875,3121,title:[[Ardrigal]],desc:\n|2764,3046,title:[[Snake weed]],desc:\n}}\nTo make the potion you need [[Ardrigal]] (obtained during the [[Jungle Potion]] quest) and [[Snake weed]].

In addition, the skills to go through the [[Shaman Caves|cave]] again (indicated above)<!--: 50 [[Agility]], 50 [[Thieving]], 52 [[Mining]] and 50 [[Strength]].''-->''\n\n'''''Recommended items: '''[[Super restore potion]] in case of failed obstacles. [[Salve amulet]] or [[Salve amulet (e)]] for fighting the 3 [[undead]] warriors.''\n\nGo back to [[Ungadulu's cave]] and head down into the cave again, going through all the same areas that you did before. Kill a [[death wing]] on the way past if you have yet to complete a [[Karamja Diary#Hard|Karamja Hard Task]].\n\nWhen you reach the area with the seven pools, head further to where another door is. Cast any [[Charge Orb]] spell on it to go through. You'll find yourself in a room with several [[Barrel (Viyeldi caves)|barrels]] in it. You can smash them to reveal things like [[food]], [[rope]], [[weapons]], or sometimes enemies. For now though, ignore them.\n\nUse your rope on the [[Winch (Viyeldi caves)|winch]] and drink the bravery potion before heading down into the depths of the [[Viyeldi caves]]. If you've brought along a [[Salve amulet]], now is the time to equip it. If the rope disappears, searching the winch again will cause it to reappear. Climb down the winch.\n\nYou'll be on the top of a long, winding path with several [[Rocky Ledge|rocks]] covering it. The [[Blue hat (Legends' Quest)|blue wizard hat]] to the right of the ladder is the spirit of [[Viyeldi]], which you can take to talk to or skip past for now. Climb over these rocks to the bottom of the path, but be warned. '''If you fall off, you can take extremely heavy damage (40+)''', depending on where you fell. You may also be immediately attacked by one of the three warriors mentioned below.\n\nOnce at the bottom, you'll see three groups of different [[undead]] warriors named [[Ranalph Devere]] (level 92), [[Irvig Senay]] (level 100), and [[San Tojalon]] (level 106), who will drop the [[Lump of crystal|lump]], [[Hunk of crystal|hunk]], and [[chunk of crystal]], respectively. Approach them and fight them individually. There are multiple of each warrior in the room. If you are using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]], hiding behind one of the empty ore rocks allows you to [[safespot]] them. Once you've defeated them, they won't attack again. Take the crystals over to the [[Furnace (Viyeldi caves)|furnace]] to the north-east, and put them in to make a [[heart crystal]].\n\nGo south to the shimmering field and look at the [[minimap]]. If you haven't noticed already, the area to the north-north-west looks like the head of a dragon.\n[[File:Legends' Quest - Viyeldi caves mossy rock.png|thumb|220x220px|The mossy rock that players must use the heart crystal on to activate it.]]\nGo to where the eye is, and use the crystal on a [[Mossy rock (Viyeldi caves)|mossy rock]] there. It will glow. Go back to the shimmering field, place the crystal in the heart-shaped recess next to it, and pass through the barrier. On the other side of the barrier are three [[lesser demon]]s, and past them to the west is the source of the pure water.\n\n==The second battle==\n'''''Recommended:'' [[Demonbane weapons]] (eg. [[Archlight|Arclight]], [[Silverlight]], [[Darklight]]) '''\n[[File:Legends' Quest - Echned Zekin appears.png|thumb|220x220px|Echned Zekin, the ancient spirit.]]\n\n\nYou'll notice that there is a boulder blocking the water flow. Try to push it, and a spirit named Echned Zekin (which is an anagram of [[Nezikchened]]) will appear. He'll say he's being tortured and beg you to help him by killing the spirit, [[Viyeldi]]. He'll give you a [[dark dagger]] to do so.\n\nIf you have no intentions of killing Viyeldi, you still have to accept the dagger from Echned, as the dagger must be given to [[Ungadulu]] in order to proceed with the quest.\n\nThere are now two paths to choose from.\n\n:'''Note:''' Players who leave the cave will need another [[Charge Orb]] spell to get through the door again. You will not need another rope or bravery potion.\n\n===The short path===\n'''Note: If you choose the short path, you will have to fight the three undead warriors again in the final battle!'''\n\nDo as the spirit asks. Walk back to the rock path with the blue wizard hat that you climbed down, and climb the rocks back up to the very top (you cannot fail here).\n\nYou may have noticed a [[Blue hat (Legends' Quest)|blue wizard hat]] on the way in—maybe even tried to pick it up. If you did, you met a spirit named [[Viyeldi]], who [[Echned]] wanted you to kill. Stab him with the [[dark dagger]] (use the dagger on him while the dialogue is shown); then, go back down to the boulder.\n\nBefore pushing the boulder, proceed to the southern boulder if you wish to [[safespot]] [[Nezikchened]]. Tell Echned Zekin that you did as he asked, use dark dagger on him. Nezikchened will reveal himself and attack the player, draining the player's [[Prayer]].\n\nAfter the battle, push the boulder out of the way of the water's flow. You may need to try from different angles, try from the East side.\n\n===The long path===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Dark dagger]]; the same items as for '''Finding the water source''', including another unpowered orb and runes to cast any [[Charge Orb]] spell (but you will not need another rope or bravery potion).''\n\n:''Skip the \"long path\" if you did the short path.''\n\nDo not try to pick up the [[Blue hat (Legends' Quest)|blue hat]] or talk to [[Viyeldi]].\n\nBank if desired. Go back to the beginning of the cave, investigate the fire wall and [[Ungadulu]]'s magic will allow you to pass through the fire wall safely. Use the [[dark dagger]] on Ungadulu. He will recognise the evil in the dagger and take it from you, giving you a [[Holy Force]] spell card, which will reveal the spirit's true form.\n\nNow, head back down to the bottom once again. You'll have to use another [[Charge Orb]] spell to get back in (including another unpowered orb). Search the winch to make the rope reappear.\n\nAt the bottom, you'll have to fight [[Nezikchened]] again. Choose the southern boulder if you wish to safespot him. Push the boulder and Echned will appear again. Do not tell him you lost the dagger or he will damage you. To start the fight, cast the Holy Force spell (left-click on the card) when Echned is near you, and he will transform into Nezikchened and attack you. At the start of the battle, your Prayer will be halved. Nezikchened fights with a very ineffective [[magic]] attack at the beginning of the battle, and he'll soon realise that it doesn't work and will switch to [[melee]]. Defeat him however you like. '''After the battle, push the boulder out of the way of the water's flow and fill the bowl from the pool below it.''' You may need to try from different angles, try from the East side.\n\n:'''Note:''' If you don't kill [[Nezikchened]] fast enough, he will reset, causing you to have to push the boulder again to talk to him. The combat will reset, and he will have full [[health]] as well as drain your [[prayer]] again.\n\n==Restoring the totem==\n'''''Items required:''' [[Radimus notes]], [[axe]] ([[Rune axe|rune]] or higher required to cut the [[yommi tree]]), [[machete]], [[bullroarer]], [[yommi seeds]], [[blessed gold bowl]], and any [[equipment]]/[[potions]]/[[food]] you need for the most difficult battle of this quest.''\n\n'''''Skills required:''''' {{SCP|Herblore|45|link=yes}} ''to plant the yommi tree,'' {{SCP|Woodcutting|50|link=yes}} ''to create the [[yommi totem]].''\n\n*'''Note for Ironmen: Do not make the [[yommi totem]] until you have all the [[magic logs]] you need!''' Allowing a [[yommi tree]] to die and then chopping it down has a 1/4 chance to yield magic logs. This can be done quickly by not watering it, letting it die in the sapling stage, and hopping between three separate worlds. At the minimum [[Herblore]] requirement to plant the tree, about 192 seeds should be enough to get 16 magic logs accounting for a high (66%) failure rate from planting the seeds. When a dead tree is chopped down, the soil is damaged, so the player will have to hop worlds or move to another spot. It's possible to walk/run between two fertile soils and plant two yommi trees at once. While this can take awhile, it is more reliable and has lower requirements than most other [[Magic log#Obtaining magic logs|sources for magic logs]].\n\nReturn to the pure water pool, then use the bullroarer to call [[Gujuo]] for instructions on what to do next. Fill the bowl again. Find a patch of [[Fertile Soil (scenery)|fertile soil]] - it will be bare of vegetation and brown on the map. Plant the germinated seeds in the fertile soil and wait for the tree to grow (boost for 45 Herblore here if needed). If it says you planted the seeds incorrectly, just keep trying until it works (the chance of planting it successfully is based on your Herblore level). The growing process only takes a matter of seconds so be prepared. Once the tree reaches the second stage, use your bowl of water on it. The third and final stage is the '''adult''' yommi tree. Use your axe on it, and keep doing this until you've chopped all the branches off and shaped it into a [[yommi totem]]. You'll know it's done when you can pick it up.\n[[File:Legends' Quest - Chopping yommi tree.png|thumb|220x220px|A player creating the yommi totem.]]\n\n*'''Note:''' Keep alert, because once the Yommi tree has reached the adult stage, you'll have only a brief window of time where you can cut it, or it will go rotten, and you will need to start again.\n\nIf you lose all your seeds, you can always go back and get more from [[Ungadulu]] in the cave. Remember to germinate them with the sacred water.\n\n==The final battle==\nNow, find any of the locations where there's an old, brown totem. One is located just east of the pool, but there are others all over the forest. Once you find one, make all the preparations you need to fight. Turn on [[Protect from Melee]] and use your new totem on the old one.\n\nNote: you cannot replace the totem if you have inspected it recently. Wait a short time for it to return to its default state.\n\n[[File:Legends' Quest - Final Nezikchened fight.png|thumb|220x220px|Nezikchened returns to destroy the hero once and for all.]]\nWhen [[Nezikchened]] spawns, he will say his dialogue and begin attacking you! You are immobile while he is speaking and can take heavy damage, so '''it is highly recommended to turn on Protect from Melee before replacing the totem to be safe'''.\n\nIf you chose the '''short path''', you will need to kill the three undead warriors you saw down in the [[Viyeldi caves|dragon cave]] once again. He will summon them one at a time, going from the strongest to weakest in terms of combat level. After each hero is killed, make sure that Protect from Melee is up as the interlude repeats, and [[Nezikchened]] will freely hit you four times on three occasions, which can deal a lot of damage if he gets lucky with his hits. '''Low levels should note that if you kill the three undead warriors and then leave, you will not have to fight them again upon returning.'''\n\nIf you took the '''long path''', Nezikchened will not summon the undead heroes because Viyeldi is protecting them, but be cautious as he will hit four times before the fight.\n\nNezikchened will attack and drain your [[prayer]]. He attacks with [[Melee]] and [[Magic]], which is much more effective this time. He doesn't use Magic that much if you melee him. Using [[Ranged]], Magic, or a [[halberd]] from between the trees with [[Protect from Magic]] on will allow you to defeat him without losing [[health]].\n\n:'''{{Colour|red|Warning:}}''' If you take too long to fight him, he will disappear. When you resummon him, he returns with full health.\n\n==Finishing up==\nWhen [[Nezikchened]] dies, replace the totem, and [[Gujuo]] will appear to thank you for defeating the demon. He'll give you a totem pole as a reward for everything you've done.\n\nReturn to [[Radimus Erkle]] with the [[Radimus notes]] and [[gilded totem]] ([[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|blr}}), who will then let you into the guild. He will train you in one of 12 various skills of your choice up to four times. After all the experience rewards are claimed, the quest is complete.\n\n'''Congratulations!

Go to the [[Adventurers' Camp (Lumbridge Swamp)|Adventurers' camp]] located at the north-west edge of the swamp and find a [[Warrior (Lost City)|Warrior]], [[Archer (Lost City)|Archer]],  [[Wizard (Lost City)|Wizard]], and [[Monk (Lost City)|Monk]] standing around a campfire. Talk to the warrior, and ask, ''\"What are you camped out here for?\"'' He will let it slip that he is searching for [[Zanaris]]. Ask, ''\"Who's Zanaris?\"'', and then, ''\"If it's hidden, how are you planning to find it?\"'' Lastly, say, ''\"Looks like you don't know either,\"'' and in his anger, he will accidentally reveal that there is a [[leprechaun]] hiding in a nearby tree who knows how to get to [[Zanaris]]. Open up your quests tab and verify that you have started the quest.\n[[File:Lost City - Chop Tree.png|thumb|220px|\"Chop\", instead of \"Chop down.\"]]\nTake a few steps north-west, and look for a tree that only has a \"Chop\" option instead of a \"Chop down\" option. Click on the tree, and a leprechaun named [[Shamus]] will pop out. Ask him \"''How does it fit in a shed then?''\", and he will tell you that you need a [[Dramen staff]] made from a [[Dramen branch|Dramen tree branch]] cut from the [[Dramen tree]] in [[Entrana Dungeon]] beneath [[Entrana]].\n\n===The island of Entrana===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[knife]].

Store your axe in the bank deposit box and take the boat to Entrana. When you get off the boat, go to the east; then north over the bridge; then west. You will find a [[Cave monk]] next to a dungeon entrance. Make sure not to have crafted the Battlestaff or a Bow before climbing down the ladder. You will be kicked off of the island and have to start over. Climb down.\n\n'''Note:''' when you enter the dungeon, your prayer will be reduced to nearly 0. If you aren't safespotting, it's suggested that you bring at least one prayer potion to counteract the effect.\n\nOnce in the dungeon, you will need to obtain a [[woodcutting axe]]. The most straight-forward way to accomplish this is to kill [[Zombie (Entrana Dungeon)|zombies]] (level 25) until one of them drops a [[bronze axe]]. There is a safespot by the mushrooms against the west wall, and another by the little group of mushrooms in southern part of the zombie area. If using the [[Crumble Undead]] spell to fight zombies, make sure to save runes for some 20-30 casts for use against the [[Tree spirit (Lost City)|Tree spirit]] later. Once you have obtained an axe, go south through the cave until you see some [[greater demon]]s and a small cave off to the south. ('''{{Colour|red|Warning}}: Do not go through the magical door to the east, it takes you to level 32 wilderness'''.) Run past the demons to the south, and chop the [[Dramen Tree]] found inside.\n\n[[File:Tree spirit (Lost City) safespot.png|thumb|290px|A safespot for ranging or casting magic on the Tree Spirit.]]\nA level 101 [[Tree spirit (Lost City)|tree spirit]] will appear. An easy way to safespot this fight is to run all the way to the north (with the tree spirit in tow) and then all the way to the south behind the mushrooms. The most efficient strategy it to bring runes and safely kill it with [[Magic]] from the safespot. [[Crumble Undead]] is extremely effective even at low levels. If intending to use [[Ranged]] to kill the tree spirit, bring plenty of arrows (200+ if at a low Ranged level), the materials to fletch a bow, and preferably some materials to craft ranged armour.\n\nIt ''is'' possible to have someone else weaken the tree spirit by indirectly damaging the tree spirit with a [[ring of recoil]]. The player doing the quest must deal at least 1 damage at any point during the fight for the kill to be counted. A second possible safe spot is to cut the branch at first from the South-side of the tree, doing this means the tree spirit will spawn on the other side of the tree from you. from there you can just magic it to death as usual. Do not use the mushroom by the greater demons outside of the room as a safespot, as even if you kill the tree spirit, they will respawn again after trying to cut the tree.\n\nOnce you've defeated the tree spirit, cut the tree again to get a [[Dramen branch]].\n\n'''Note:''' A dramen branch is required for the [[Freeing Sir Amik Varze]] subquest of [[Recipe for Disaster]], and another is useful for the smuggling into [[Thorvald]]'s trial in [[The Fremennik Trials]], but do not make them into staves yet. Cutting at least three branches is recommended.\n\nUse a [[knife]] on the [[Dramen branch]] to get a [[Dramen staff]].\n\n'''{{Colour|red|Warning}}:''' If you decide to go through the magical door, you will be teleported into level 32 [[Wilderness]].\n\n===Finishing up===\n{{Map|3204,3169|r=3|mtype=square|caption=Entrance to Zanaris.|align=right|width=200|height=200}}\n'''''Items required: '''[[Dramen staff]]''\n\nTeleport out and go to the [[Shed (Lumbridge Swamp)|tool shed]] in the centre of [[Lumbridge Swamp]], north-west of the [[Lumbridge Swamp training mine]].

One of them will tell you that they saw a goblin with huge eyes in the castle basement. '''Note:''' '''Once someone has told you that they saw a goblin, you do not need to question anyone else.'''\n\n[[File:The Lost Tribe - the goblin brooch.png|thumb|220x220px|Finding the [[brooch]].]]\nReport this to the [[Duke Horacio]]. [[Sigmund]] will join in on the conversation. After the conversation is finished, you'll be able to go down to the basement, entrance is in the kitchen through the trapdoor.\n\nOnce in the basement look for a blocked tunnel (rubble) on the east side of the cellar. Use your pickaxe on it. Light your [[Light sources|light source]], then squeeze through (requires 13 Agility), grab the [[brooch]], and turn back. Otherwise, you'll fall into a pit.\n\nGo back to the duke and show him the brooch. You will be asked to show it to [[Reldo]] in the [[Varrock Palace Library|library]] (located north of the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}) in [[Varrock Palace]].\n\n===Investigating in the library===\n[[File:The Lost Tribe - goblin symbol book location.png|thumb|220x220px|The bookshelf where the book is located]]\nShow the [[brooch]] to [[Reldo]], the librarian. He'll tell you to search the bookcases for a book on goblin history, the [[Goblin symbol book]]. It's called \"the History of the Goblin race\" when you first pick it up, but the character mentions that \"this must be it\", so you'll know when you've hit the right shelf. The book is found in a [[Bookcase (The Lost Tribe)|bookcase]] at the north-western portion of the room; the furthest up the west wall of the room.\n\nTurn to the last page to see that the symbol on the brooch translates to \"[[Dorgeshuun]], goblins of the strong spears\". Keep the book for the remainder of the quest since it's very important.\n\n===Goblin history===\nHead to [[Goblin Village]] (using a [[Falador Teleport]] or [[Mind Altar Teleport]] via Arceuus spellbook) and talk to the Generals. Eventually, they will teach you the goblin salute and the goblin bow [[emotes]].\n\nDuring the dialogue with the Generals, you should choose the following options:\n[[File:The Lost Tribe - goblin generals teach greetings.gif|thumb|220x220px|The goblin generals teach the player the goblin greetings.]]\n{{Checklist|\n*Have you ever heard of the Dorgeshuun? (1)\n*It doesn't really matter (3)\n*Well either way they refused to fight (2)\n*Well I found a brooch underground... (3)\n*Well why not show me both greetings? (3)\n}}\n\nYou will then receive confirmation you've learned both emotes. Double check your emote page to be sure, then move on to the next section.\n\n===The Goblin Maze===\nGo back to Lumbridge, and talk to the duke. He will tell you to investigate the caves further. Go back into the tunnel. '''See the map for the correct path.''' \n\n'''Warning''': Players using [[Light sources#Types of light source|an open flame]] must pay very close attention to this guide. Taking the wrong route will cause a trapdoor to be opened, which leads to the [[Lumbridge Swamp Caves]], which has explosive [[swamp gas]]. Players using such a light source might want to consider bringing a teleport out (such as the [[chronicle]], for lower-levelled players) in case they take the wrong route. When taking the correct route, no swamp gas will be encountered, so open flames are safe in that case.\n\n[[File:The Lost Tribe - tunnel symbol.png|thumb|220x220px|One of the symbols on the rock.]]\nIf you go the wrong way, one of two things will happen:\n\n#A rock will fall in front of you or on top of you, dealing damage.\n#You'll fall down a trapdoor and end up in the main part of the [[Lumbridge Swamp Caves]]. Exposed flames will be put out, so be ready to use your Tinderbox to relight it. You can find your way back through the hole you created earlier by heading north.\n\nThe way through the Goblin Maze is the same for all players. See the map.\n\n===Contact===\nWhen you reach the end, you'll find the [[Dorgeshuun]] tribe. Talk to [[Mistag]], and do your [[Goblin Bow]] in front of him. He will tell you that the Dorgeshuun are actually peaceful, and the Lumbridge kitchen incident was an accident. You'll also learn about the [[goblin (race)|goblin]]s' backstory. Mistag will offer to take you back to [[Lumbridge]] if you ask him to show you the way out. Agree and talk to the duke.[[File:Dorgeshuun_Tunnels.png|center|frame|A map of the tunnels.]]\n\n===Missing silverware===\n[[File:The Lost Tribe - silverware location.png|thumb|160x160px|The [[silverware]]!]]\nSpeak with the [[Duke Horacio|duke]] and tell him that you've made contact with the goblins. Some [[silverware]] was stolen from the castle basement, and the goblins are being blamed for it.\n\n[[Pickpocket]] [[Sigmund]] (requires 13 Thieving) and unlock his [[Chest (The Lost Tribe)|chest]] (located in the [[spinning wheel]] room) to find some [[H.A.M. robes]] (keep them as you'll need these for [[Death to the Dorgeshuun]], the sequel [[quest]]).\n\nTell the duke that Sigmund is part of [[Humans Against Monsters]].\n\n{{Map|mtype=square|r=3|3165,3252|align=right|width=150|height=150|caption=Trapdoor location}}\nExit through the west side of Lumbridge castle and go to the [[H.A.M. Hideout]] (the trapdoor entrance is north-west of [[Lumbridge castle]]; pick the lock; you do not need a lockpick).\n\nYou will find the stolen silverware in the crate near the entrance, before the large meeting area.\n\nGive it back to the duke, who will fire Sigmund.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Peace===\n[[File:The Lost Tribe - the peace summit.png|thumb|220x220px|The meeting between Duke Horacio and Ur-tag.]]\nThe [[Duke Horacio|duke]] will give you a peace treaty. He will sign it and ask you to set up a meeting with the leader of the [[Dorgeshuun]] to sign it as well. Go into the tunnel. This time, you won't have to navigate through yourself because you'll see a new goblin there, [[Kazgar]], whom you will follow to the mines.\nTalk to [[Mistag]], who will summon the Dorgeshuun leader, Ur-tag to sign the treaty. The signing will commence with a cutscene in the Lumbridge dining room, with you and Mistag as witnesses. During the cutscene you will see [[Sigmund]] outside, saying that the goblins will soon be destroyed.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n{{Listen\n|title=[[Dorgeshuun Treaty]]\n|align=right\n|desc=The music track that only plays during the cutscene.\n|filename=Dorgeshuun Treaty.ogg\n}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Lost Tribe\n|image = [[File:The Lost Tribe reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Mining|3,000}} [[Mining]] [[experience]]\n*The ability to use the [[Goblin Bow]] and [[Goblin Salute]] [[emotes]]\n*Access to the [[Dorgesh-Kaan mine]]\n*A [[ring of life]]\n*Access to [[Nardok's Bone Weapons|Nardok's Bone Weapon's store]] where players can purchase the [[Dorgeshuun crossbow]], [[bone bolts]] and other [[bone weapons]].\n*A [[mining helmet]] from giving the [[brooch]] back to [[Mistag]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of The Lost Tribe is required for the following:\n*[[Death to the Dorgeshuun]]\n*[[Wanted!]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* If the player has completed the quest [[Dragon Slayer I]] or [[Rune Mysteries]], Sigmund will convince Duke Horacio to listen to them by telling him that the player is the adventurer who slew [[Elvarg]] or that they were the one who delivered the [[Air talisman]] to Sedridor.\n*Father Aelbeck will also remark about [[Restless Ghost]] and the Cook about [[Recipe for Disaster]]\n\n{{The Lost Tribe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Lost Tribe, The}}\n[[Category:Dorgeshuun]]"

If you put the [[emerald lens]] in the given lantern, drop it and ask for a new lens, which you then use on your working brought bullseye lantern.\n\n===Part 1 - The Ship===\n{{Needed|[[Tinderbox]], [[Bullseye lantern]] (or [[swamp tar]])}}\n\n'''Note:''' If you have a [[bullseye lantern (unf)]] in your bank, you will have to bring it with you, or else [[Cabin Boy]] will not give you one.\n\n*Take your [[tinderbox]], your choice of transport to [[Rellekka]], and talk to [[Lokar Searunner]] on the westernmost dock of Rellekka. He will tell you about the [[Moon Clan]].\n*Talk to [[Brundt the Chieftain]] in the longhall, and get a [[seal of passage]]. '''Keep it with you at all times when you're on the [[Lunar Isle]] or any related areas''', or else you'll get teleported back to Rellekka, even when the quest is over. '''Note:''' If you lose or destroy the seal and have a placeholder for it in your bank, Brundt won't give you a replacement until you remove the placeholder.\n*Talk to [[Lokar]] again to sail to the [[Pirates' Cove]]. Climb the ladder on the dock you arrive at in order to board the [[Lady Zay]].\n*Talk to [[Captain Bentley]] on the ship and ask him to sail you to the Lunar Islands. The ship will proceed to only sail around the island in a circle, befuddling the captain. Talk to the Captain again. '''Note:''' You and the captain must be on the boat and not the docks in order for the story to progress.\n*Talk to the navigator [['Birds-Eye' Jack]], found at the rear of the lower deck.\n*Talk to the captain again to ask what happened, and suggest it was the navigator's fault.\n*Talk to the navigator again — he will mention a jinx being put on the ship.\n*Talk to the captain, and he will tell you to talk to members of the crew for help. '''You must talk to them in the sequence below.''' \n*Talk to [['Eagle-eye' Shultz]], located on the same deck as the captain at the far northern end of the ship. He will tell you about jinxes.\n*Talk to the [[Cabin Boy]] up one deck from the captain (south).\n*Talk to [['Beefy' Burns]] on the lowest most deck (go down two decks to where the navigator is. Then, go north and climb down the stairs and south to the galley (kitchen) area to find him).\n*Talk to [['Lecherous' Lee]] next to the cabin boy on the uppermost deck.\n*Talk to [[First mate 'Davey-boy']] (same deck as the captain).\n*Talk to the cabin boy, who will now confess to placing the jinx. ('''Make sure you have two empty inventory spaces.''') You should now have received an [[emerald lantern lens]] and an unfinished [[lantern]] (if the cabin boy didn't give an unfinished lantern, one may be in your bank)\n*'''Use the lens on the working lantern you brought, not the [[bullseye lantern (unf)]] the cabin boy gave''' (if you accidentally use it on the unfinished lantern, drop it and talk to the cabin boy to receive another emerald lens), to get an [[emerald lantern]]. Use a tinderbox on the lantern to light it.\n**'''If you couldn't bring a functional bullseye lantern, you will have to fuel the lantern yourself by doing the following:'''\n*** Pick up [[swamp tar]] from a tar barrel. You can find one in [['Birds-Eye' Jack]]'s room. Another one is located on the dock, right next to the gangway.\n***Head to the still inside the [[Chemist's House]] in [[Rimmington]].\n*** Use your [[swamp tar]] on it.\n*** Combine the emerald lens with the lantern the cabin boy gave, and use the emerald lantern on the [[lamp oil still]] to fill it with lamp oil.\n\n[[File:Finding jinx.gif|frame|A player finds a jinx.]]\n\n* Next, you need to find five symbols and wipe them all away. The seals are on the following locations (use your lantern on the object to reveal the symbol):\n**'''Big and metal:''' The eastern cannon by the cabin boy (if this didn't work, try the other cannon).\n**'''Wallchart:''' Same floor as Captain, towards the rear of the ship in the First Mate's cabin.

There is a [[bank]] and a [[general store]] on [[Moonclan Island]], so you can get items here. \n\nFind [[Meteora]] in the village; she is on the south-western side of the village by the wall. She will tell you that although they don't have a leader, the [[Oneiromancer]] will be able to help you more than anyone. Walk to the south-eastern part of the island, and find the Oneiromancer (near the [[Astral Altar]]), who tells you that you will need three things (which must be done in the following sequence).\n\n====Waking sleep potion====\n{{Needed|[[Guam leaf]], [[Marrentill]], [[Pestle and mortar]], [[Suqah tooth]]|recommended=[[Combat equipment]] to kill [[Suqah]]s if you do not already have the tooth}}\n\nTalk to [[Baba Yaga]] in the chicken house in the village (north of the bank in the fenced area — it walks like a chicken). She will give you a special potion bottle, and tell you that you need a [[guam leaf]], [[marrentill]] and a crushed [[Suqah tooth]].\n\nFirst, fill the [[empty vial]] from a nearby water source (using a [[bucket of water]] does not work); then travel to the south-east again, and kill a [[Suqah]] (level 111). Suqah can be [[safespotted]] using the tree on the path to the [[Oneiromancer]]. The tooth does not drop every time, but it's fairly common. '''Make sure to also pick up [[Suqah hide|their hides]], as you will need four of them later on''' (note that you do not need to get all four hides now, as you will be killing more Suqah to obtain the [[Lunar amulet|amulet]] later). They also drop guam and marrentill herbs. Once you have a tooth, add the guam leaf and marrentill to the vial, and then crush the Suqah tooth with the [[pestle and mortar]] to get a [[ground tooth]]. Add the ground tooth to the vial and then talk to the Oneiromancer again to give her the potion.\n[[File:Enchanting dramen staff.gif|thumb|220px|A player enchanting the [[Dramen staff]].]]\n\n====Lunar staff====\n{{Needed|[[Dramen staff]] (will turn into a [[lunar staff]] - bring several if you want multiple lunar staves), necessary items to access all four ([[Air Altar|air]], [[Fire Altar|fire]], [[Water Altar|water]], and [[Earth Altar|earth]]) elemental rune altars (either the corresponding talismans or tiaras, an [[elemental talisman]], access to the [[Abyss]], or [[Guardians of the Rift]] minigame).}}\n\n'''Talk to the [[Oneiromancer]] to give her the potion before starting the staff.''' You won't be able to make lunar staves after this next part (and must pay 30,000 coins for more), so it is advisable to make more than one. Take your [[dramen staff]] (or staves) to all four elemental altars '''in this order: Air, Fire, Water and Earth'''. Once there, 'use' the staff on each of the four altars.\n\n* The '''air altar''' is located in the mysterious ruins south of Falador. The quickest method to reach it is to teleport to the [[Crafting Guild]] via a [[skills necklace]] then run east, alternatively teleporting to Falador and running south-west from the southern gates.\n* The '''fire altar''' is located in the mysterious ruins north-east of Al Kharid. The quickest method to reach it is to teleport to [[Emir's Arena]] via a [[ring of dueling]] then run north, alternatively, running east from Lumbridge or north-east from the [[gnome glider]].\n* The '''water altar''' is located in the mysterious ruins south-west of Lumbridge. The quickest method to reach it is by using a Fairy Ring to enter [[Zanaris]] then exiting via the ring next to the [[Chicken Shrine|chicken shrine]] and running west to the altar from the shack; alternatively teleporting to Lumbridge and running south-west from the graveyard exit or teleporting to the [[Wizards' Tower|Wizard's Tower]] via a [[necklace of passage]] and running east.\n* The '''earth altar''' is located in the mysterious ruins north-east of Varrock, just south-east of the lumberyard. The quickest method to reach it is to use a [[lumberyard teleport]] and run south-east, alternatively teleporting to Varrock and running north-east or teleporting to the [[Digsite pendant|Digsite]] and running north-west.\n\nThe [[lunar staff]] or staves you create will change names depending on which step you are currently on in enchanting it. Only enchanting it with the air element labels the staff 'Lunar staff pt 1', with air and fire 'Lunar staff pt 2' and so on and so forth. After the fourth enchantment of earth, it becomes a lunar staff that you are unable to equip until you are able to wear clothes of the [[Moon Clan]].\n\n* If you want to have more than one lunar staff, turn all of the [[dramen staff|dramen staves]] into [[lunar staff|lunar staves]] '''BEFORE''' turning in one of your lunar staves to the [[Oneiromancer]] for the quest.\n\n* If using [[fairy rings]] to transport yourself, bring one regular dramen staff with you to use for fairy rings, as you will be unable to equip the Lunar Staff after you make them. However, once you give a lunar staff to the Oneiromancer, any extra you previously made will become equipable AND can be used to access fairy rings.\n\nTake the staff to the Oneiromancer to proceed. The Oneiromancer will keep one of your lunar staves until you have made a set of lunar clothing.\n\n====Ceremonial clothes====\n{{Needed|[[Seal of passage]], 400 [[coins]], [[Pickaxe]], [[Hammer]], [[Needle]], 2 pieces of [[Thread]] or [[Costume needle]], 4 [[Suqah hide]], [[Spade]]|recommended=Combat equipment to kill several Suqah.}}\n[[File:Mining stalagmite.png|thumb|220px|Mining the stalagmite for the [[Lunar helm|helm]].]]\nThese consist of eight different items:\n*[[Lunar helm|Helm]] - Take your [[pickaxe]] and [[hammer]], and travel north-east of the island, and you should find a [[Lunar Isle mine|dungeon.]] You must run past some [[Suqah]], which may cast [[Ice Barrage]], to reach it. Once inside, mine any stalagmite to get some [[lunar ore]]. Only one lunar ore is needed to craft the [[Lunar helm|Helm]], but if you plan to do [[The Fremennik Exiles]] later, you can save some time by getting three additional ores now. There is a furnace and anvil in [[Rellekka]] where you can [[Smithing|smith]] the helm. You can return to Rellekka quickly by destroying the [[Seal of passage]], and speaking to any of the lunar citizens. (Remember to speak to [[Brundt]] for another seal, before you return to the island.)\n*[[Lunar cape|Cape]] - Talk to [[Pauline Polaris]] to the north-western side of the village. You have to guess her name; first guess ''Pauline'' and then after receiving a clue, choose ''Jane Blud-Hagic-Maid.''\n*[[Lunar amulet|Amulet]] - Talk to [[Meteora]] in south part of the village. She'll tell you that she'll swap her amulet for her [[A special tiara|tiara]] that she lost to one of the Suqah. Kill [[Suqah]] to get it back (it can take five or more Suqah kills to get the tiara) and '''keep the hides''' until you have four (you will need them for the next step), and then exchange the tiara for the amulet.\n*[[Lunar torso|Torso]], [[Lunar gloves|Gloves]], [[Lunar boots|Boots]] and [[Lunar legs|Legs]] - Speak to [[Rimae Sirsalis]] at the clothes shop; she will tell you that she can tan [[Suqah hide]]s for 100 coins each. Collect four Suqah hides if you haven't already, get them tanned, and with some [[thread]], use a [[needle]] on the [[Suqah leather]] to make the four items. (She sells needles and thread.)\n[[File:Lunar ring location.png|thumb|300px|[[Lunar ring]] location]]\n*[[Lunar ring|Ring]] - Speak to [[Selene]] near the centre of the village; she will give you a riddle. Take a [[spade]], and travel round outside the southern side of the village to the west until you come to a bridge. Dig on the blue flowers to the very south-west of the island, as shown in the picture. Make sure you complete the dialogue or else you will not receive the ring.\n\nTake all items back to the [[Oneiromancer]], and she will give you all your obtained items back (make sure you have 11 free inventory spots) plus some [[kindling]] that was obtained from the first ever [[magic tree]] and a [[waking sleep vial]].\n:'''Note''': You can use the vial on the kindling, drop the [[soaked kindling]], and talk to the Oneiromancer again to obtain a second vial and kindling. It is recommended to obtain a few spares because logging out or losing connection in the Dream World means another kindling will be required to re-enter.\n\n===Part 3 - Dream World===\n{{Needed|[[Seal of passage]], all 9 pieces of [[lunar equipment]], [[tinderbox]], [[soaked kindling]].|recommended=[[Food]], an [[axe]], [[runes]] to cast [[combat spells]] (without use of an [[elemental staff]]), an [[Agility boost]] such as a [[Summer pie]] if your [[Agility]] level is low.}}\n\n'''Note: you cannot use any other combat equipment (including staves, armour and potions) in the [[Dream World]].

Talk to the [[Ethereal Being]] on the central platform, where they will tell you that you need to face six puzzles. At the edges of Dream World are stone portal-like things; step into them to attempt each puzzle. After completing each puzzle, talk to the being in the centre again to discuss what the challenge has taught you.\n===== '''1.

You need to get the dice to add up to the numbers that the Ethereal Fluke calls out, but it's not as random as it seems; the dice only have two possible combinations when you roll them, corresponding to the number opposite them on a die. Opposite sides of a die always add up to '''7''', meaning the following:\n\n*Centre dice are worth either 1 or 6\n*East dice are worth either 4 or 3\n*West dice are worth either 5 or 2\n\nWhen the puzzle resets, the initial value will always come out to 21. Based on this, one can easily solve this puzzle with a little addition or subtraction.\n\n* Flipping a '''1''' will add 5 to the total\n* Flipping a '''2''' will add 3 to the total\n* Flipping a '''3''' will add 1 to the total\n* Flipping a '''4''' will subtract 1 from the total\n* Flipping a '''5''' will subtract 3 from the total\n* Flipping a '''6''' will subtract 5 from the total\n[[File:Fluke challenge.png|right|220px]]\nExample solve: the Ethereal Fluke asks for 20, so flip a 4 over to reach the goal.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dice Possibilities\n|2/5\n|\n|\n|3/4\n|-\n|\n|1/6\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|1/6\n|\n|-\n|2/5\n|\n|\n|3/4\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable lighttable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Number\n!Answer\n|-\n|'''12'''||1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3\n|-\n|'''13'''||1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4\n|-\n|'''14'''||1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4\n|-\n|'''15'''||1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 3\n|-\n|'''16'''||1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4\n|-\n|'''17'''||1, 1, 2, 5, 4, 4\n|-\n|'''18'''||1, 1, 5, 5, 3, 3\n|-\n|'''19'''||1, 1, 5, 5, 3, 4\n|-\n|'''20'''||1, 1, 5, 5, 4, 4\n|-\n|'''21'''||1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4\n|-\n|'''22'''||1, 6, 2, 5, 4, 4\n|-\n|'''23'''||1, 6, 5, 5, 3, 3\n|-\n|'''24'''||1, 6, 5, 5, 3, 4\n|-\n|'''25'''||1, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4\n|-\n|'''26'''||6, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4\n|-\n|'''27'''||6, 6, 2, 5, 4, 4\n|-\n|'''28'''||6, 6, 5, 5, 3, 3\n|-\n|'''29'''||6, 6, 5, 5, 3, 4\n|-\n|'''30'''||6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4\n|}\n\nOnce finished, you'll be taken back to the centre. Tell the Ethereal Being what you've learned and enter the next puzzle.\n\n==== '''2. Communicating in numbers''' ''([[platform (Lunar Diplomacy)#Numerator|pink south-eastern platform]])'' ====\nThe [[Ethereal Numerator]]'s challenge is to complete mathematical sequences by pressing the correct floating numbers. The Ethereal Numerator will call out a sequence, and you must figure out the pattern and press the next two numbers. For example, if the sequence is 1, 4, 2, 5, the first answer is 3 ('''''1''''', 4, '''''2''''', 5, '''''3''''') and the next answer is 6 (1, '''''4''''', 2, '''''5''''', 3, '''''6''''').\n\nIt is possible to get the same sequence more than once.

Chop, Chop, Chop away!''' ''([[platform (Lunar Diplomacy)#Perceptive|blue north-eastern platform]])'' ====\n[[File:Chopping dream tree.png|thumb|220px|Chopping dream trees.]]\nThis is a simple [[Woodcutting]] game, wherein all you must do is chop more [[logs]] than the [[Ethereal Perceptive]]. The goal is to be the first one to stack 20 logs in the centre on the \"Deposit [[Log pile (Lunar Diplomacy)|Log pile]]\". If you're limited on inventory spaces, simply chop a few at a time and then stack them and continue cutting, but note that once you have deposited 20 logs, you'll be '''unable to pick up your items.''' The Ethereal Perceptive supplies a [[bronze axe]] if you don't have an axe of your own. This is one of the easier challenges.\n\n\n==== '''4. Where am I?''' ''([[platform (Lunar Diplomacy)#Guide|white north-western platform]] - pink on iOS)'' ====\nThis challenge tests your memory. Speak to the [[Ethereal Guide]], you have to jump between platforms hoping not to find the false platforms that will collapse and return you to the start.\n[[File:Dream puffs.png|thumb|right|220px|Hopping around the dreamy puffs.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable underpasstable\" data-fallback=\"Unfortunately, this tool is not yet supported for mobile browsers.

The race is on!''' ''([[platform (Lunar Diplomacy)#Expert|yellow-green eastern platform]])'' ====\n[[File:Lunar Diplomacy race.png|thumb|220px|Jumping the hurdles.]]\nA simple [[Agility]] test. Beat the [[Ethereal Expert]] to the end of the passage by jumping four hurdles whilst he walks a straight path. This is fairly easy though an [[Agility potion]] and some food might help because failing a hurdle will cost you 8 [[Hitpoints]].\n\n==== '''6. Anything you can do...''' ''([[platform (Lunar Diplomacy)#Mimic|teal south-eastern platform]])'' ====\n[[File:Anything you can do....png|thumb|right|220px|Mimicking the Mimic.]]\nA mime-copying game, very similar to the [[Mime (Random Event)|mime]] [[random event]]. Simply copy the emotes the [[Ethereal Mimic]] uses. After each emote, the mime will teleport to a different location. Talk to them again for the next.\n\n====The fight====\n[[File:Fighting Me.png|thumb|220px|Fighting [[Me]].]]\n:'''Note:''' If the fight doesn't start after the white screen, you will need to try again for a few times, it will eventually let you in. Also, try dropping your axe and then talking to the guide, or dropping your axe and picking it up again before talking to the guide.\n\nOnce you've completed all the challenges, talk to the guide in the centre, and they will ask if you are ready to face the ultimate challenge. Say that you are, and you get to face \"[[Me]]\", a level 79 opponent who's pretty easy and is geared to your [[stats]]. You will occasionally be teleported around this arena, but this is more annoying than dangerous. The chats are quite amusing from \"Me\", so listen out!\n\nOnce you have defeated \"Me\", talk to the guide at the centre of the [[Dream World]], then exit via the lectern, and go and talk to the [[Oneiromancer]] again.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n'''Tip:''' Before leaving Lunar Isle you can unlock the [[Ourania Teleport]] spell. If you intend on doing this, switch spellbooks to the Lunar spellbook at the altar next to the Oneiromancer before going to [[Baba Yaga]].\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Lunar Diplomacy\n|image = [[File:Lunar Diplomacy reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Magic|5,000}} [[Magic]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Runecraft|5,000}} [[Runecraft]] experience\n*A [[seal of passage]]\n*Access to [[Lunar Isle]] and [[Lunar equipment]]\n*Access to the [[Lunar spellbook]]\n*Access to the [[Astral Altar]]\n*50 [[Astral rune]]s\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Me]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Lunar Diplomacy is required for the following:\n*[[Dream Mentor]]\n*[[The Fremennik Exiles]]\n*[[Hard Fremennik Diary]]\n*[[Elite Morytania Diary]]\n*[[Elite Kandarin Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*After you give [[Meteora]] her special tiara, she still seems to be wearing the [[Lunar amulet]] on her head on her chathead and in-game.\n*Meteora's dialogue is a subtle reference to the way a peasant speaks to King Arthur in the movie ''{{wp|Monty Python and the Holy Grail}}''.\n*Having the [[Book o' piracy]] in your inventory at the start of the quest modifies some of the pirate's conversation with you.\n*Before you enter the dream, if you re-obtain the [[kindling]] and [[Waking sleep vial|potion]] from the [[Oneiromancer]] and then soak the kindling and drop it, you are left with an [[Empty vial|empty lunar vial]]. You can fill this up with water again and mix in a [[guam leaf]] and a [[marrentill]] once more for 84 [[Herblore]] [[experience]] per herb; you cannot, however, empty out the [[Guam-marr vial|vials]] and must go through dialogue to get more of them.\n*During the quest, [[Captain Bentley]] tells the player he stole the ship from a Karamjan port and that the doors were too small for his crew. This is a reference to the [[Grand Tree Quest]], in which [[Glough]], a gnome, commissioned ships to be built at the [[Shipyard]] on Karamja for his gnome army.\n*At a certain point when speaking to Captain Bentley, you start the dialogue by saying \"Oh captain, my captain\". This is a reference to the poem of the same name by Walt Whitman, popularised by the film ''{{wp|Dead Poets Society}}''.\n*In the \"Communicating in Numbers\" section of the [[Dream World]], the examine text for the number 3 is ''\"The magic number\"''. This is a reference to the ''{{wp|Schoolhouse Rock!}}'' song \"3 Is A Magic Number\".\n*In the \"Chop, Chop, Chop Away!\" section of the Dream World, the examine text for the pile of logs is ''\"Like a pile of memes\"''.\n*The examine text of a Suqah tooth is ''\"The tooth, whole tooth, and nothing but the tooth\"'', which is a reference to the legally binding oath that is used in the United States' courts before a witness testifies.\n*When examining the Mimic, the text reads ''\"I wanna be like you-ooo-ooo!\"'' This is a reference to King Louie from the animated film ''{{wp|The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book}}''.\n*In the Dream World, if you click on one of the Ethereal Beings while still in the falling animation, your character will turn to them while still face down.\n\n{{Lunar Diplomacy}}"

[[Player-killers]] are able to attack you while you are doing the minigame fight.\n|leagueRegion = {{RE|Wilderness}} - location requirement\n}}\n\n==Walkthrough==\n===Getting there===\nHead out into level 56 [[Wilderness]] to start, but watch out for player-killers. The arena has a bank, so there is no need to bring any equipment besides a [[knife]], [[sword]], or other slashing weapon. The quickest way to get there is by use of the lever in the ruins of [[Edgeville]] or in the small building near the gate to [[West Ardougne]]. Pulling either of these levers will teleport you to the [[Deserted Keep]], a small island surrounded by lava in level 54 Wilderness. From there, run north, slash the web with your [[knife]], [[sword]], or other slashing weapon, and then proceed west a short distance to the northern entrance of the [[Mage Arena]].\n\nNorth-west of the actual Mage Arena is a little broken down house. Use a [[knife]] or a [[weapon]] which has the '[[slash]]' [[attack style]] to cut down the webs in the house. Once the two webs have been cut, pull the [[lever (Mage Arena)|lever]] on the wall of the house to be teleported into a small cave. While you are in this first room, you are completely safe from [[PKers]]. In here is a [[Lundail's Arena-side Rune Shop|rune store]], a [[bank]], and [[Kolodion]], the [[non-player character]] who must be talked to in order to start the Mage Arena miniquest. Kolodion will also be fought during the miniquest, so just talk to him to begin. After a long dialogue, you will fight him.\n\n===Battling Kolodion===\n[[File:Fighting_Kolodion.png|thumb|left|A player engages in combat with Kolodion.]]\n[[Kolodion]] changes form as the fight progresses. At the start, he appears in the form you see him when you speak to him. He can only be damaged using [[Magic]]. After defeating this form, he transforms into an [[ogre]]-type creature. Despite being in [[Melee]] range, this form and all forms afterwards are magic-based, so the [[Protect from Magic]] [[prayer]] will make you invulnerable to all of his attacks. The next form is a giant [[Ice spider|frost spider]], then a [[ghost]], then finally a level 112 [[black demon]].\n\nFor all of these battles, it is recommended to use the strongest [[spell]] you have the level for. As each form changes, the [[Hitpoints]] of the form increases. With the Protect from Magic [[Prayer]] or decent [[food]], the battles are fairly easy to win. At level 70+ Magic, only around 100 casts of [[Blast spells|blast]] or [[Wave spells|wave]] spells are needed to defeat all five of Kolodion's forms. [[Iban Blast]] is also a viable option as its power allows for Kolodion's defeat in as few as 50 casts, even at level 60 Magic wearing only [[Mystic robes]].\n\nYou can exit the fight at any time by running out of the arena and pulling the lever to the north. Kolodion will be in the form you left off at when you return.\n\nYou may also use a [[powered staff]] for this fight, avoiding the need to bring runes with you.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reward==\nOnce Kolodion is defeated, the mini quest ends and players will be teleported out of the arena, and Kolodion will congratulate them on a fight well fought. He will then ask players to choose their [[Gods#Major Gods|God]]. To do this, head into the nearby 'Sparkling pool' and you will come out near a staff merchant. Head past him into the room with the three god statues. Now, choose your god and pray at the relevant statue. Players will then receive one of the [[god capes]], determined by which god is prayed to. After receiving the cape, head back south and speak to the chamber guardian to receive one of the [[god staves]] which will be the matching partner to the cape.\n\n'''Note:''' Players can receive multiple [[god capes]] of the same or different variant, either now or later, by praying again at the relevant statue. \n\nTo unlock the [[god spells]] and use them outside of the arena, they must be cast 100 times inside the arena ( You can enter the arena using the lever on the north side of the arena ).  The best method would be to only bring 100 casts of the [[god spells|spell]] you want to unlock, together with some [[prayer potions]] for [[Protect from Magic]] or cheap food like [[wines]]. As for equipment, bring the [[god staff]] of the spell of your choosing, wear either cheap/replaceable [[prayer items]] to pray Protect from Magic longer, or [[black d'hide armour]] to have cheap high magic defence, should you choose to [[tank]] them with food, rather than praying. You do not need to deal damage with the spell, only cast it 100 times, so the d'hide armour is a very cheap high-defence choice. Check your [[items lost on death]] screen to make sure you aren't bringing more than necessary.\n\n'''Note:'''  PK Skull Prevention is useful here as Player Killers are able to dress up as a Saradomin mages and hop worlds in order to [[Skull (status)|skull-trick]] players into losing all of their items. Also note, due to having to cast the spells manually, hiding the attack option won't prevent getting tricked. To avoid getting skull-tricked, you can wield the [[Void Knight Mace]], [[Staff of the Dead]] or [[Staff of Light]] to auto-cast their respective spells.\n\nTo obtain other god staves to cast other god spells outside the arena, talk to the [[Chamber guardian]] (who will charge 80,000 [[coins]] per staff) and then cast the other spell 100 times in the arena.\n\nGod staves cannot be wielded with the cape of another god; for example, the [[Saradomin cape]] may not be worn while wielding a [[Guthix staff]]. The capes are required to cast the [[Charge]] spell at level 80+ Magic, and can be changed by praying at the desired god's statue.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable lighttable\"\n|+ Runes required to learn each spell\n|-\n!

Players with level 75 [[Magic]] and the ability to cast [[Saradomin Strike]], [[Flames of Zamorak]], and [[Claws of Guthix]] outside the [[Mage Arena]] can start this [[miniquest]] by talking to [[Kolodion]] in the [[Mage Arena]] bank.\n\nHere, players must defeat three powerful god followers roaming the Wilderness; [[Porazdir]], [[Justiciar Zachariah]] and [[Derwen]] and collect their remains in order to enhance one of their [[god capes]] upon quest completion.

Beware of Player-killers at all times.\n|leagueRegion = {{RE|Wilderness}} - location requirement\n}}\n\n==Walkthrough==\n===Starting out===\nHead to the broken down house north-west of the [[Mage Arena]] in level 55 [[Wilderness]]. Use a [[knife]] or [[slash weapon]] to cut down the two webs in the house. Once the webs have been cut, pull the lever on the wall to be teleported into a small cave. The cave is a '''safe zone'''; you cannot be attacked by other players inside here.\n\nSpeak to [[Kolodion]] about additional challenges. He will tell you that he has been working on a spell that will increase the powers given by your [[god cape]], but the components he requires are difficult for him to obtain. As the spell imbues the power of the three [[gods]], namely [[Saradomin]], [[Zamorak]], and [[Guthix]], he requires the components of three powerful opponents who are each aligned to a god. You will then receive the [[enchanted symbol]]. This acts similar to the [[Enchanted key (item)|enchanted key]] and [[strange device]].\n\n===Tracking===\n<!-- this isn't using the regular map template because it's not really possible to do multiple different boundaries in the same map with it, the \"geojson\" stuff is hugely bloating so is in mapspace and transcluded here-->\n{{Map:God followers spawn locations}}\n\nBefore tracking down the followers, it is '''highly recommended''' to set the Player 'Attack' option to \"Always right-click\" or \"Hidden\" in the ''Controls'' panel in the [[Options]] interface, as well as enabling \"PK Skull Prevention\", so you do not accidentally become [[skulled]].\n\nAfter you have received the [[enchanted symbol]], you can look for the three god followers located within the deep [[Wilderness]], around [[Lava Dragon Isle]]. Most areas will be in [[multi-combat]] zones, so stay cautious! Each use of the symbol can deal up to 16 damage, and can kill the player.\n\nThe three god followers can be tracked in any order, as you choose the follower to track with each use of the symbol. Once a follower is defeated, the symbol will no longer track that follower until the miniquest is complete.\n\nThe symbol functions similarly to the [[Treasure Trails/Guide/Hot Cold|Hot & Cold]] from Master [[Treasure Trails]]; as the player gets closer to where the follower is residing, the symbol will glow hotter, and the further you are, the colder it gets.\n\nWhen the symbol states that it is visibly shaking, the follower will appear and attack you. Since you may run out of food most of the time searching for the followers, try to pinpoint their exact location before returning to a bank to restock on food.\n\nThe follower's spawn locations are random, and will change occasionally (approximately 45 minutes between changes); you will be notified of this when you use the enchanted symbol after the spawn change. Spawn rotations are unique for each player.\n\nIf a follower has already spawned in the location where yours is supposed to spawn, you must either [[World switching|hop worlds]] or wait for it to despawn and use the enchanted symbol again. The currently active follower locations are the same between worlds.\n{{clear}}\n\n===The followers===\nThe followers are very powerful monsters, using powerful attacks and can also cast [[Ice Barrage]] and [[Tele Block]]. All followers can hit up to 43 (26 for Zachariah) with magic, and can also use melee, dealing up to 16 damage (43 for Zachariah). Protection prayers reduce the accuracy and strength of their attacks. It is possible to dodge the Ice Barrage attack by stepping off the square you were standing on when the spell was cast. Unlike other players' Tele Block, this only lasts for a minute if Protect from Magic is used, rather than two minutes. The Tele Block effect fades immediately upon killing the monster.\n\nIn addition, the followers can only be harmed by their respective god spells, so you must use all three god staves for each of the three followers. Alternatively, using the [[staff of the dead]] (or its [[Toxic staff of the dead|toxic variant]]), the [[staff of light]] or the [[staff of balance]]/[[void knight mace]] to autocast [[Flames of Zamorak]], [[Saradomin Strike]] and [[Claws of Guthix]], respectively, is recommended, as their magic attack bonuses are higher, in addition to making the fight slightly easier by allowing the player to autocast god spells.\n\nEach follower also has their own unique ability, making the fight slightly more challenging:\n\n*[[Porazdir]] can launch an energy ball at the player that can hit through protection prayers. The amount of damage it deals is dependent on your distance to him. The further you are, the less damage it deals. Near him it can hit up to 30, but if the player is at least 12 tiles away from him it will hit 0.\n*[[Justiciar Zachariah]] will occasionally swing his sword, resulting in a blue wave aimed at the player's current tile when it was used. If the player does not move, it drags them to melee distance, where he will also perform melee attacks. Simply move one tile elsewhere from its target tile to avoid the attack.\n*[[Derwen]] can launch energy balls on the ground. They heal him for 5 health every few seconds, and must be destroyed to stop him from healing. Each ball has 20 health. Claws of Guthix is not required to damage or destroy the orbs.\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nFighting Porazdir.png|A player fighting Porazdir, one of Zamorak's most trusted generals.\nFighting Justiciar Zachariah.png|A player fighting Zachariah, one of the last remaining justiciars of Saradomin.\nFighting Derwen.png|A player fighting Derwen, an ancient servant of Guthix.\n</gallery>\n\n===Locating the followers===\nThe safest method is to do the following for each follower:\n\n1. '''Locate''' a follower using the [[enchanted symbol]] while consuming a cheap food source such as [[wine]] when the symbol deals damage. Bring a [[slash weapon]] to break through webs, [[energy potions]], wine, and a level 30 teleport out of the [[Wilderness]], such as an [[Amulet of Glory]], [[Royal Seed Pod]] or [[Slayer Ring]]. Make note of the location, as you will need to return to it once geared up and restocked on food.\n\n2. '''Leave''' and use the [[Ferox Enclave]] [[Pool of Refreshment]] to reset [[stats]], [[prayers]], and [[HP]]. Next, gear up. This is the ideal time to use stat-boosting potions, cast boost spells, consume overheals, drink a [[stamina]] dose, or use (and bank) an [[imbued heart]].\n\n3. '''Return''' to the location and kill the follower. Take the remains, teleport away, bank your gear, and go to [[Edgeville]]. Note that the remains themselves cannot be banked.\n\n4. '''Hand in''' the follower's remains to [[Kolodion]]. The Edgeville [[Wilderness lever]] teleports you just east of the building with the lever. A '''[[knife]] or a slash weapon is needed''' to break the two webs leading to the Arena bank.\n\n5. '''Repeat''' for the other two.\n\n===Killing the followers===\nAs there's a risk of [[player killers]], it's a good strategy to take as few valuable items as possible. \n\nIf the followers are not slain quick enough, they will despawn, and you will have to track it again and restart the fight. It's important to kill them quickly and efficiently, and the appropriate tools and gear must be used. The example equipment here shows a viable low-cost [[magic gear]]. Although the followers have a somewhat high Magic level, this is offset with extremely poor magical defence, so it may make sense to opt for a defensive gear, such as [[black dragonhide armour]] instead of [[magic robes]], especially if your [[Magic]] level is high.\n\n====Inventory====\n{{Inventory|align=right\n|1= Stamina potion(1)\n|2= Super restore(4)\n|3= Saradomin brew(4)\n|4= Energy potion(4)\n|5= Energy potion(4)\n|6= Enchanted symbol\n|7= Blood rune\n|8= Fire rune\n|9= Air rune\n|10= Ring of recoil\n|11= \n|12= Wilderness sword 1\n|13= Shark\n|14= Shark\n|15= Shark\n|16= Shark\n|17= Shark\n|18= Shark\n|19= Shark\n|20= Shark\n|21= Shark\n|22= Shark\n|23= Shark\n|24= Shark\n|25= Shark\n|26= Shark\n|27= Shark\n|28= Royal seed pod\n}}\nYour inventory should contain:\n*[[Stamina potion]] and/or [[Energy potion]]s\n*[[Saradomin brew]]s\n*[[Super restore]]s\n*Food ([[sharks]] or better recommended). \n*[[Enchanted symbol]]\n*A [[knife]] or a [[slash weapon]] (if the target is behind a spider webbed area)\n*50+ casts of the appropriate [[god spell]] (more for [[Derwen]])\n*\n*[[Ring of recoil]] (with one already equipped)\n*An escape teleport. This can be a [[Royal Seed Pod]] or an [[Amulet of Glory]], as both work at level 30 [[Wilderness]].\n*An [[antipoison]] may be needed for some of the locations. Although the god followers do not inflict poison, [[Poison spider|poison spiders]] may roam in the vicinity of said locations.\nIt should be noted that [[Blighted|blighted supplies]] can be used.\n\n====Equipment====\n{{Equipment\n| align = right\n| head = Red hat\n| cape = Saradomin cape\n| neck = Amulet of magic\n| ammo = Rada's blessing 2\n| weapon = Saradomin staff\n| torso = Black d'hide body\n| legs = Black d'hide chaps\n| shield = Black d'hide shield\n| gloves = Rune gloves\n| boots = Mystic boots\n| ring = Ring of recoil\n| caption = Low-risk gear\n}}\n\nEven with [[Protect from Magic]], they will still hit hard and accurately, up to 20+. However, their magical defence is extremely weak and not a lot of accuracy is needed to hit on them consistently. Thus, it is recommended to wear [[dragonhide armour]], along with easily replaceable items, such as the [[Culinaromancer's gloves]], the [[book of darkness]] or a [[dragonhide shield]], and a [[god cape]]. If you have at least level 80 [[Magic]], bring additional runes for [[Charge]], as it will increase the max hit of your god spells from 20 to 30. ( ''Note - If you are doing this at 75 Magic exactly, you can drink an [[Ancient brew]] to boost to 80 and cast charge. Charge will last seven minutes. Alternatively, you can enter a practice dream at [[Nightmare Zone]] to drink a [[super magic potion]] and cast Charge before heading out to the [[Wilderness]]. It is also possible to drink a [[magic potion]] at level 76 to reach the required 80 Magic.'')\n\nIf possible, use an [[occult necklace]] and [[tormented bracelet]] for their magic damage boost to increase max hits.\n\nIf players are assigned a [[black demon]] for their [[Slayer task]], wearing a [[Slayer helmet (i)]] is recommended when fighting [[Porazdir]], as the player's attacks would be more accurate.\n\nBecause of the high damage dealt by them, taking at least two [[rings of recoil]] gives 80 free damage over the course of the fight, which can be very helpful.\n\nIt is recommended to turn off [[Auto Retaliate]] for all the fights.\n\n====Prayer====\nUse [[Protect from Magic]] and [[Protect Item]]. If [[prayer points]] can be spared (75+ [[Prayer]]), it's also an option to enable a cheap magic accuracy prayer, such as [[Mystic Lore]].\n\n===Finishing up===\nUpon killing [[Justiciar Zachariah]], [[Porazdir]] and [[Derwen]], they'll drop a [[Justiciar's hand]], [[demon's heart]] and [[ent's roots]], respectively. Once you obtain one, run back to [[Kolodion]] so that he can hold it for safekeeping. If your supplies are low, it's best to teleport back to a safe location and restock on food and potions before giving the component to Kolodion. If you're killed, you'll have to kill the follower again.\n\n===Rewards===\nAfter collecting all three components, return them to Kolodion within the [[Mage Bank]] to complete the miniquest. After you have done so, you will be able to hand a [[god cape]] to Kolodion which he will then [[imbued god cape|imbue]]. To acquire another [[imbued god cape|imbued cape]], the player must either find the corresponding follower to the cape that they wish to upgrade, kill it again for another drop and take it back to Kolodion, or purchase the cape from the [[Lost Property shop]] for {{Coins|250,000}}. It's possible to kill a follower multiple times to obtain extra components (but note that if you speak to Kolodion with duplicates of either of the components in your inventory, he will take all of them and only let you imbue one cape) to obtain more [[imbued god cape]]s.\n\nThe [[imbued god cape]], like most untradeable equipment, is automatically protected upon death in dangerous PvM scenarios outside of the [[Wilderness]]. However, should a player die to another player in the Wilderness, the player '''will''' lose the cape, and the killer will receive 60,000 [[coins]] as loot.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">>\nFile:Demon's heart detail.png|The [[demon's heart]]\nFile:Justiciar's hand detail.png|The [[justiciar's hand]]\nFile:Ent's roots detail.png|The [[ent's roots]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Controversy==\nOn release, players instead had to kill three god-aligned demons, the [[Demon of Darkness]], [[Demon of Light|Light]], and [[Demon of Balance|Balance]], and claim their hearts to finish the miniquest. However, the miniquest was criticised by players as being rushed and of lower quality than was to be expected from the Old School Team, for several reasons:\n[[File:Mage Arena II - old demon boss.png|thumb|270px|A player fighting the now-removed [[Demon of Light]] with a [[twisted bow]].]]\n*The three bosses were simply three demons recoloured from Kolodion's final form, and all of them had the same set of attacks, except for the god spells they used.\n*The bosses had moderately high offence and defence in magic, making even the use of [[Charge]]d god spells difficult to take them down.\n*Despite the [[Update:Dev Blog: Wilderness Rejuvenation II|original Developer's Blog]] stating that only god spells will harm the demons, the [[twisted bow]] was made an exception, causing the fights to be made much easier due to its [[passive effect]], with players accusing Jagex of going against what was polled.\n*The Demon of Light and Balance contradicted established lore, since demons were followers of Zamorak and were abhorred by Saradominist and Guthixian followers.\n\nAmidst these complaints, Jagex released [[Update:In Retrospect: Wilderness Rejuvenation II & W345|a newspost]] on 20 December stating that they are aware that the content was not up to the players' standards, with the post addressing the issues listed above, among other related content, with an expected rework of the miniquest coming in early 2018.\n\nThe miniquest was overhauled with [[Update:PvM QoL updates & Wilderness Rejuvenation improvements|an update]] on [[8 February]] [[2018]], addressing all the issues listed above:\n*The demons were replaced by [[Porazdir]], [[Justiciar Zachariah]], and [[Derwen]], whose appearances are unique and thematically appropriate to their alignment to [[Zamorak]], [[Saradomin]], and [[Guthix]], respectively.\n**Each boss, while having a set of attacks shared between them, has its own unique special attack.\n**Despite their magic offence being almost twice as powerful compared to the original demons, their magic defence was significantly lowered to make up for it.\n*Additional dialogue was added to Kolodion to expand the lore of the new bosses.\n*The effectiveness of the twisted bow against the bosses was removed.\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 11 December 2017\n|update = It's Christmas Time\n|change = The Mage Arena II miniquest is now listed in the correct colour on the quest list.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n\n==Trivia==\n*Upon release, the quest journal stated prior to starting the miniquest \"I must be able to defeat multiple level 257 demons\", even though only one boss is a demon and is actually level 235. This was corrected in [[Update:Tournament Worlds: Theatre of Blood rewards|an update]] on [[8 March]] [[2018]].\n*Upon release, once players had imbued their first god cape, they could imbue another cape without needing another demon's heart. In addition, casting [[High Level Alchemy]] resulted in receiving 60,000 coins. This was quickly hotfixed, with capes being obtained via this glitch and the ability to alchemise it removed.\n*It is not known whether the ability to dodge the [[Ice Barrage]] attack was intended or whether this is a bug.\n\n{{Mage Arena II}}\n{{Miniquests}}\n[[Category:Jagex controversies]]"

However, My Arm must first woo the troll maiden Snowflake and kill the Wise Old Man.\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Talk to [[Burntmeat]] in the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold's]] kitchen.\n|startmap = 2841,10060,plane:1\n|difficulty = Master\n|description = My Arm, the troll from ''My Arm's Big Adventure'', must embark on another journey of discovery.

He will tell you that an important visitor, [[Wolfbone]], has arrived, and that they require your help. Agree to help them.\nWolfbone will stop you from starting the quest if you don't have level 66 Firemaking.\nWolfbone comes from a place called [[Weiss]], a troll town far north of the Stronghold, and wants to meet with the [[mountain trolls]] to trade knowledge. His leader, [[Mother]], wants the mountain trolls to send an ambassador up to Weiss to teach the Weiss Trolls their inventions, while Wolfbone teaches theirs in the Stronghold. Burntmeat will tell you that they have chosen [[My Arm]] to be the ambassador for the mountain trolls, as he has travelled to distant lands (with you) before. Wolfbone will then show you the way to their town by sea, as climbing the mountains is too difficult.\n\nGo to My Arm by his herb patch by taking the stairs south of Burntmeat, and climbing the ladder on the wall north of [[Kob]]. You will see My Arm training [[Drunken Dwarf's Leg]] to take over his role as the herb patch caretaker. Talk to My Arm, and ask him to meet you by Larry's boat, north-east of [[Rellekka]].\n\nHead to Larry's boat. The quickest way to reach there is using the [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|DKS}}, and then running west. Talk to [[Larry]] and ask him if you could borrow his boat, and after some amusing dialogue, a short cutscene will play, showing My Arm's arrival. Speak to Larry again, and you and My Arm will sail to Weiss.\n\n===Troll Diplomacy===\n''Items required: Any [[pickaxe]] and [[rope]] (both obtainable during this part), mining and agility boosts if you need them.''<br/>\n''Items recommended: [[Weight-reducing clothing]] and [[stamina potion]]s, a teleport to [[Draynor Village]]. If your agility level is not much higher than 68, bring some food, as failing the rockslides can deal at least 15 damage.''\n\nAfter some time, you and [[My Arm]] will arrive just north of [[Weiss]]. As My Arm cannot climb the rockslide, you must find a way to help him. Search the wrecked boat and obtain a [[rope]] and [[bronze pickaxe]] if needed. A [[hammer]] can also be taken if one hasn't been obtained by the player.\n[[File:Making Friends with My Arm - Climbing rockslide.png|thumb|250px|Climbing up the cliff to reach Weiss.]]\nAttempt to mine the cave entrance. After some dialogue, boost up your [[Agility]] if necessary (68 required), climb up the rockslides, and use a rope on the tree. Next, climb the rope and cross the ledge. Lastly, climb the next rockslide and pass the fallen tree.\n\n{{Listen\n|title = Kicked out of Weiss\n|align = right\n|filename = Kicked out of Weiss.ogg\n|desc = The track that plays upon getting knocked out.}}\n\n====Weiss surface====\nOnce you've reached the top, speak to [[Boulder]]. He will refuse to let you in, as humans are not welcome in the town and disbelieves that you brought a troll along. Instead, go east of him and sneak in through the gap in the fence. You will enter an [[instanced]] version of the city with trolls throwing rocks at you, which will knock you out of the city if they hit you. Be sure to read through below and reference the diagrams, as once you start running, unless you are in a safe area, the trolls will hit you and kick you out. Running diagonally tends to help evade troll throws.\n\nGo south along the city's edge, then west, moving from safespot to safespot if necessary, until you come across a small alleyway east of the ice wolf pen. Move yourself to Safespot 1 shown on the right. Then, click on the bucket spawn a little to the north-west to move to Safespot 2.\n\nNow for the hardest part: click on the Little Boulder (it has a left-click 'Cross' option) just north of the troll [[Yellow Snow]] to begin running there. Once you are a tile away from the boulder (but before you reach it), click on the hole to the north. If everything goes correctly, you should make it inside, but this may take a few attempts. Once inside, '''DO NOT''' try to use the ramp; instead, '''immediately''' click on the narrow gap to the south, near the body of water.\n[[File:Weiss Safespot 1.png|thumb|Safespot 1 (the player's location) and Safespot 2 (the red dot north-west of the player, between two trees).]]\n\n====Cave level====\nFollow the path and swim through the water, again avoiding the thrown rocks. At the end will be the [[cave exit (Weiss cave)|cave exit]] that needs to be unblocked for My Arm to enter, requiring 72 [[Mining]]. However, before you can mine it, a path of five stepping stones needs to be created in the water for My Arm to walk on, conveniently provided by the trolls above throwing their rocks into the water. To create this path, first swim to the other side. Click the square you want a stone thrown to, and then move one square away when you see the troll's throwing animation begin. Continue this until the path is completed (it will need to be five boulders long), then boost up if necessary, mine the rubble, and let My Arm walk in. The trolls cease attacking once they see My Arm and will take you to the city's leader — [[Mother]], his bodyguard [[Don't Know What]], and his inventor assistant [[Odd Mushroom]]. He also has a daughter, [[Snowflake]], with whom My Arm falls in love.\n\n[[File:Making Friends with My Arm - Swimming in Weiss cave.png|thumb|250px|Swimming through the Weiss cave, evading trolls in the process.]]\n\nOnce Mother asks what My Arm has to offer to the trolls of Weiss, pick every chat option possible. Mother will be uninterested in any of the offerings My Arm has to make any business with Weiss, and he is adamant that trolls only need to be concerned about physical strength and prowess; he also wants his daughter to marry Don't Know What, who would inherit the throne once Mother dies, though Snowflake secretly opposes the arrangement.\n[[File:Making Friends with My Arm - Troll invasion.png|thumb|250px|Once upon a time, the Weiss trolls attacked the dwarves of Keldagrim...]]\nHaving nothing to offer to Mother, you and My Arm leave the hut. Outside, speak to My Arm, and pick every chat option once more. You will learn from Odd Mushroom that the trolls of Weiss once lived further south near [[Keldagrim]], and was driven away by a then-young [[Wise Old Man]]. A plan is devised to let My Arm impress Mother by faking the killing of Wise Old Man, a long-time enemy of the Weiss trolls.\n\n===The Wise \"Dead\" Man===\n*''Items required: [[Hammer]], [[saw]], 5 [[mahogany plank]]s, a [[bolt of cloth]], [[cadava berries]], [[bucket of water]]. This part will automatically go to the combat sequence when complete although you can exit to gear up before battle.''\n*''Recommended: Draynor teleport method, Varrock teleport method, Weiss travel method''\n\nMake your way to [[Draynor Village]] where you will have to talk to the [[Wise Old Man]]. Ask him to help [[My Arm]]. He will initially refuse, as he is more of an adventurer than a family mediator; after reminding him of you saving his life during [[Swan Song]], he will agree to help you.\n\nHe will ask that you build a mahogany coffin and have the [[Apothecary]] brew a [[cadava potion]] that is suited for his age. The coffin can be built next to him, granting the player 715 [[Construction]] experience. This can be boosted by wearing pieces of the Carpenter's outfit.\n\nMake your way to the Apothecary in [[Varrock]], and have him make a [[reduced cadava potion]]. Return to the Wise Old Man and talk to him. He will then drink the potion and \"die\". Pick up the [[old man's coffin]], and make your way back to [[Weiss]], and speak to My Arm. You can avoid climbing the rockslides by entering the cave you cleared out earlier, which takes you directly into the city.\n\nMy Arm will now offer the Wise Old Man's \"corpse\" to Mother, but he doubts its authenticity due to a lack of battle wounds. Odd Mushroom will attempt to persuade Mother to accept My Arm into the tribe and have Snowflake marry him, but Mother is still set in his ways, claiming that she needs to marry a proper troll like Don't Know What.\n[[File:Making Friends with My Arm - My Arm's deceit.png|thumb|250px|My Arm, Snowflake, Odd Mushroom and you attempt to convince Mother that My Arm killed the Wise Old Man.]]\nSnowflake will then become enraged at Mother, telling him he shouldn't tell her how to think and love, and declaring her love for My Arm. He still insists that My Arm is not to be trusted. Suddenly, the Wise Old Man begins snoring. Odd Mushroom will claim that it is the remains of his magic escaping his body. The Wise Old Man will then break wind, convincing Mother that this is all a trick. Mother will become enraged and throw rocks at you, My Arm and Snowflake before battering Odd Mushroom, throwing the group into the cells below.\n\nTalk to Odd Mushroom. He will tell you that Mother has lit a [[Fire of Domination]], which drastically increases his strength and prevents teleportation magic from working, indicating his intention to kill everyone. Odd Mushroom will instruct you to find his notes where he writes down his inventions, so that Snowflake can carry on with his inventions. Shortly afterwards, Odd Mushroom succumbs to his wounds. Snowflake will then ask you to kill her father as revenge for killing Odd Mushroom, seeing Odd Mushroom more of a father than Mother.\n\nThe Wise Old Man will warn you to prepare accordingly before the fight as you will be unable to teleport out for the next two combat sequences.\n\nIf players need to escape, they must use the smelly hole found within the cell. This will take them outside of [[Weiss]] right next to the boat.\n\n===Matricide===\n{{Needed|[[Ranged]] equipment, [[bucket of water]]}}\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Making Friends with My Arm - Fighting Don't Know What.png|thumb|left|220px|Fighting Don't Know What.]]\n\n'''Note:''' You '''cannot''' teleport out of this fight. Despite what the Wise Old Man says, items may be reclaimed upon death from a gravestone outside [[Weiss]].\n\nOnce ready, the Wise Old Man will break the cell door, and [[Don't Know What]] will attack while [[Squirrel (troll)|Squirrel]] flees to warn Mother. He uses [[ranged]] attacks that can hit through the player's [[protection prayers]]. These attacks are different from his normal attacks, with a different animation. When doing the attacks that hit through protection prayers, two boulders are thrown: one where the player is standing and the other for the normal attack. If you successfully dodge the one that is thrown where you are standing then you will not take damage from it, so he can be beaten by running around the arena while attacking with ranged. He has 220 [[Hitpoints]], and is very resistant to [[magic]], so [[melee]] or ranged attacks are recommended. Even though Snowflake, My Arm, and the Wise Old Man assist you in the fight, they will not do much damage. Both Don't Know What and Mother are vulnerable to venom (and poison).\n\n[[File:Making Friends with My Arm - Fighting Mother.png|thumb|220px|You and the gang battle against Snowflake's father, Mother.]]\nAfter defeating Don't Know What, you and the gang will have to fight Mother. '''Before fighting him''', you must '''take a [[bucket]]''' next to the large barrel '''of water, fill it with water and extinguish the fire of domination''', or else none of your attacks will hit. You may also escape through the staircase to replenish your supplies. When you come back to Weiss, enter through the cave and you will start the fight with Mother from the beginning. If you die during this fight you will only need to fight Mother again, and will not need to re-do the fight with Don't Know What. Similarly, if you already put out the fire, you will not need to do so a second time. \n\nOnce Mother has switched to [[Protect from Magic]], you have successfully put out the fire. Mother uses the same attacks as Don't Know What, but also uses a melee attack that drains prayer. To easily beat Mother, use ranged with [[Protect from Missiles]] and run away from him around the arena so he does not hit you with his melee attack. You can also use melee and not run away, but then you will have your prayer drained and you will be stunned.\n\n===A New Leader===\n''Items required: [[Bucket]]''\n\nAfter killing Mother, Snowflake will call all the trolls of Weiss and declare herself as the new leader of Weiss, with all of them in agreement, stating she is much nicer than Mother. She will then ask you to perform the wedding ceremony for her and My Arm; they will say their vows, and you will pronounce them as husband and wife. They will then perform the ancient dance of love.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nMaking Friends with My Arm - Stepping up as leader.png|Snowflake declares herself the new leader of Weiss.\nMaking Friends with My Arm - Wedding.png|The wedding ceremony of Snowflake and My Arm.\nMaking Friends with My Arm - Ancient dance of love.png|The newlyweds performing the ancient dance of love.\nMaking Friends with My Arm - Snowflake and My Arm forever.png|Snowflake and My Arm forever!\n</gallery>\n\nAfter the ceremony, Snowflake will ask you to fetch some [[goat dung]] for her. [[goat poo (scenery)|Piles of goat poo]] can be found in the north-east building. You will need a [[bucket]] to pick up the dung; you should still have it from the fight against Mother. If not, simply pick up another bucket next to the large barrel of water.\n\nReturn to Snowflake, who will make two [[herb patches]] just west; one to grow [[goutweed]], and one for you. She will then give you Odd Mushroom's [[Weiss fire notes|notes]], which contains the information required to light braziers. Read it, and speak to her once more.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n'''Optional post-quest reward''' - Players can return to [[Burntmeat]] and [[Wolfbone]] to inform them of the situation in [[Weiss]], and to give Burntmeat the notes. As Burntmeat has felt that you dislike his burnt meat, he will have Wolfbone reward you instead.

Attempting to alchemise the coffin, a dialogue message shows up with: ''You sense the Wise Old Man's disapproval''.\n*While speaking to the [[Apothecary]], and having the required [[cadava berry]] before he asks you for it, he will tell you \"''That's very clever. I hope you've got a real feeling of pride and satisfaction from that.''\" This is a reference to controversy and backlash that arose from game developer {{wp|Electronic Arts}} implementing a micro-transaction system within the video game ''{{wp|Star Wars Battlefront II}}''.\n*After Odd Mushroom's death, Snowflake expresses how she knows what to do, and that she must overthrow Mother. The various characters in the dungeon saying \"You have my support\" and My Arm follows with \"And My Arm\". This is a reference to the movie adaption of The Fellowship of the Ring, where Gimli offers his assistance to the fellowship by saying \"And my axe\".\n*After killing [[Don't Know What]], [[Squirrel (troll)|Squirrel]] runs to [[Mother]], declaring \"''OLD MAN IN THE DUNGEON!''\" which is a reference to ''{{wp|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}'' when a troll is released in the school and Professor Quirrell (notice the name similarity) bursts into the Great Hall yelling, \"''TROLL IN THE DUNGEON!''\"\n*When [[Mother]] is justifying himself to [[Butterfly (troll)|Butterfly]] and [[Odd Stone]] about wanting to kill [[Snowflake]], he says \"We are trolls, not softy liberals like [[Snowflake]]\". This is a pun about the state of politics in the United States.\n*The ancient dance of love [[My Arm]] and [[Snowflake]] perform is a reference to how two players circle around one another when they follow each other.\n*Although [[Mother]] uncovers the deception after the [[Wise Old Man]] passes gas, in real life it is not unusual for a fresh corpse to pass gas.\n*Using a bucket of [[goat dung]] on [[Goat Poo]] after the wedding, makes him say, ''\"Look, human, it were one time.

It is directly south of the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]] (One can use a Necklace of passage and teleport to ''The Outpost''). In order to save the outpost from [[King Lathas]], the player will need to talk to [[Silver merchant|Erin the silver merchant]], [[Droalak]] the ghost, and [[Dron]] the warrior. They can be visited in any order, and the player does not need to revisit Jorral until they've met all characters. Before all of this, Jorral takes you into a cutscene.\n\nNote: If the door is open when talking to Jorral, occasionally an aggressive hobgoblin can attack you during the cutscene, which will cancel the dialogue afterwards and force you to watch the cutscene again. \n\n===Erin the silver merchant===\n{{Needed|[[Spade]].}}\n{{Map|2442,3139|mtype=square|r=4|align=right|width=250|height=250|caption=The location to dig for the chest.}}\n''Note: Erin won't talk to you if you've recently stolen from his stall.'' \n\nTalk to Erin, the Silver merchant, in East Ardougne. He is at the north-western stall in the central market. He will tell you about his great grandfather, and that he has an [[Enchanted key (item)|enchanted key]]. Ask him if you can borrow it and he will agree. The key changes temperature as you walk. \n\nTeleport to Castle Wars (ring of dueling or minigames teleport) and cross both of the bridges to the north until you are around 4 steps north from the east side of the second bridge. As soon as you feel that the enchanted key is steaming, take out your spade and dig to find a [[Chest (Making History)|chest]]. Use the enchanted key to open it and you will find a Journal.\n\nThe enchanted key cannot be used to find additional treasure until this [[quest]] is complete. If the player uses the key, they get the message, \"You have already found the chest\" (if not opened to get the journal yet) or, \"You have already found the journal\". If the player has already given the journal to Jorral, the message is, \"You've already delivered the journal.\"\n\n===Droalak the ghost===\n{{Needed|[[Ghostspeak amulet]], [[Sapphire amulet]].|recommended=[[Ectophial]] ''(If [[Ghosts Ahoy]] has been completed.)''}}{{Map|3659,3475,icon:bluePin,desc:Droalak|3673,3482,icon:redPin,desc:Melina|mtype=pin|caption=Locations of Droalak (blue) and Melina (red).|align=right|width=250|height=250}}\n\nTravel to [[Port Phasmatys]]; if [[Ghosts Ahoy]] has not been completed, you must pay two [[ecto-token]]s to the town guards. (''Get ecto-tokens by heading to the Ectofuntus, just north of Port Phasmatys. Use the bones in the bone grinder on the second floor, get a bucket of slime from the trapdoor west of the fountain, and use those items on the fountain. Then, talk to a ghost disciple to claim your ecto-tokens.)'' The port can also be reached by [[Charter ship|Charter Ship]] to Port Phasmatys or use [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|ALQ}} (Note: fairy ring still requires ecto-token).\n\nOnce in Port Phasmatys, head to the general store. Then talk-to [[Droalak]] in, or around the general store. He will give the player a scroll if they give his wife, [[Melina]], a strung [[sapphire amulet]]. Melina is in the building directly east of the general store.\n\n(Note: To make a strung sapphire amulet if you don't already have one, use a gold bar on a furnace while having a cut sapphire and amulet mould in your inventory. Then use a ball of wool on the unstrung sapphire amulet, to get a strung sapphire amulet.)\n\nAfter giving Melina the amulet, the player must go back to Droalak to receive the scroll.\n\n===Dron the warrior===\nGo to [[Rellekka]] (players can use fairy ring code {{Fairycode|AJR}} to reach the nearby slayer dungeon or [[Fremennik sea boots]] to teleport.) Talk to Dron's brother, [[Blanin]] (he can be found near the [[Dairy churn]], east of the Longhall). \n\nGo north of [[Skulgrimen's Battle Gear]], and speak to [[Dron]]. He can be found close to the northern-most dock. He will quiz the player on the information that Blanin gave them. Dron will ask various questions; these are the answers (in the order used):\n\nTo get through the conversation quickly, the numbers you can press are: 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1.\n*''I'm after important answers''\n*''Why, you're the famous warrior Dron!''\n*He wields an '''iron mace''' in battle.\n*He eats '''rats''' for '''breakfast'''.\n*He eats '''kittens '''for '''lunch'''.\n*He eats '''bunnies''' for '''tea'''.\n*His favourite drink is '''red '''spider blood.\n*He is '''36 years, 8 months (21 days) old.'''\n*He studies the '''Fifth '''and''' Fourth '''ages.\n*His house is on the '''north-east side''' of town.\n*His brother's name is '''Blanin'''.\n*His pet cat is named '''Fluffy'''.\n*5 and 7 is '''12.'''\nDron will immediately end the conversation if a wrong answer is given.\n\nAfter answering the questions, Dron will reveal part of the outpost's history that involves two friends battling each other at the Outpost. One sided with Zamorak, and the other sided with Saradomin. It's later learned that they both decided to stand down after observing the destruction of the battle, and chose to side with Guthix. As time went on, one became King of Ardougne and the other ran the Ardougne marketplace.\n\n===Back to Jorral===\nGive everything to [[Jorral]]. He'll give the player a letter to take to the king of [[East Ardougne]]. [[King Lathas]] can be found upstairs in his [[Ardougne Castle|castle]] in central Ardougne just across the river. He will give back a letter to take to Jorral, in which he promises not to tear down the outpost. After taking it to Jorral, Jorral will make a museum out of the Outpost.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Making History\n|image = [[File:Making History reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 3\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Crafting|1,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*{{SCP|Prayer|1,000}} [[Prayer]] experience\n*750 [[File:Coins 250.png]] [[coins]]\n*[[Enchanted key (item)|Enchanted key]], allowing you to go on your own treasure digs until it disappears\n*Access to the museum in the outpost\n*Ability to complete [[master clue scroll|master clue]] [[Treasure Trails/Guide/Hot Cold|hot/cold Treasure Trails]].\n*Ability to claim 5 [[Kudos]] and an [[antique lamp]] for 1,000 [[experience]] (in any skill over level 20) by talking to [[Historian Minas]] in the [[Varrock Museum]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Making History is required for the following:\n*[[Song of the Elves]]\n*[[The Enchanted Key]] (miniquest)\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 17 January 2019\n|update = Kebos Graphical Changes and Other Fixes\n|type = mobile\n|change = The chatbox interface no longer obstructs cutscenes on mobile.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*If you visit [[Droalak]] after the quest, the player's character will tell him that they have delivered the scroll and it was of good use. Droalak finally rests in peace.\n*When the quest is completed, [[Jorral]] will tell you there is something that may interest you in his museum. If you search the [[bookcase (Outpost)|bookcase]] and choose the book titled '[[The Mysterious Adventurer]]', it will be a book written about your character, telling you stories of some of your completed quests.\n*Jorral's quote \"Do you want to know more?\" at the beginning of the quest is a reference to a repeated line in the 1997 film ''{{Wp|Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers}}''.\n*If you talk to [[Jorral]] before completing this quest whilst having a [[master clue]] in your inventory, he will reply with '\"Stop! I can't help you unless you help me out first.\" To which your character replies \"Okay then, moving on ...\" and continues the dialogue of the quest.\n*Studying the 'Large Display' when the museum is built, shows Wally's helmet. Recall, during the 'Demon Slayer' Quest, Wally is seen defeating Delrith the Demon in a flashback 150 years ago.\n*Also, displayed in the museum is 'The axe of Arrav'. It was left behind by an adventurer on a quest to find 'The shield of Arrav', needed to save the people of Avarrocka.\n{{Making History}}"

Recognising you as an \"easterner,\" Emelio will enlist your help in a business venture involving something called a kabit.\n[[File:Meat and Greet - spice box PIN.png|thumb|150px|The PIN pad for the spice box.]]\nAfter you inform him that what he's speaking about is in fact called a [[kebab]], Emelio will share his goal of introducing the kebab to [[Varlamore]] by opening up a shop. However, he'll mention that the spices and meat he ordered have not been delivered yet, and will ask you to speak to the [[Spice Merchant|spice merchant]] in the [[bazaar]] and [[Alba]] at [[Ortus Farm]] to see what the delay is.\n\n=== Supply chain issues ===\nHead west into [[Civitas illa Fortis]], to the bazaar, and speak to the spice merchant in the south-eastern corner of the market. Ask her about the missing delivery, and she'll tell you the spices arrived that morning; however, [[Ali Morrisane]], her \"reputable\" supplier, sent them in a locked box. Offer to help her open the box, which is a four-digit PIN. Based on the brightness of the keypads, the order of the numbers is '''2546'''. Press the {{Mes|→|colour=white|size=14|bg=grey}} key to open the box, and she will send the delivery to Emelio.\n\nNext, head further west to the [[Ortus Farm]], and speak to [[Alba]] inside the building. She will tell you the order was delayed due to a pack of wolves causing issues for the farm. You will offer to deal with it, and she'll tell you that their den is directly west of the farm. Run all the way westwards until you see a pack of [[dire wolves]], and enter the wolf den to face the level 113 [[Dire Wolf Alpha]].\n[[File:Meat and Greet - Dire Wolf Alpha safespot.png|thumb|360x360px|The safespot used to fight the alpha wolf.]]\nThe alpha dire wolf uses a strong [[melee]] attack, and can summon dire wolves that accurately attack with ranged. However, the alpha will only summon wolves if the player is within melee distance. Players can use a safespot to safely kill the alpha by quickly moving behind the stalagmites north of the cave exit at the start of the fight.\n\nReturn to Alba to inform her the problem has been dealt with. She'll tell you that the meat was delivered during your time away, so head to Emelio's house to check in.\n\n===The golden ratio===\n[[File:Vincens chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nReturn to Emelio's to find he has gathered three \"connoisseurs\" from the nearby pub, and given them the individual ingredients to try. He will ask that you find the perfect ratio for the kebab. Talk to [[Vincens]], [[Renata]], and [[Lucas]] for their opinions on the ingredients:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Connoisseur comments\n!Connoisseur\n!Ideal ratio\n!Formula\n!Conclusion\n|-\n|Vincens\n|As much sauce as spice and salad combined\n|S<sub>1</sub> = S<sub>2</sub> + S<sub>3</sub>\n|Sauce must be '''3 portions'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Renata\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Less spice than there is salad\n| rowspan=\"2\" |S<sub>2</sub> < S<sub>3</sub>\n|Spice must be '''1 portions'''\n|-\n|Salad must be '''2 portions'''\n|-\n|Lucas\n|Twice as much meat as there is salad\n|M = 2*S<sub>3</sub>\n|Meat must be '''4 portions'''\n|}\nSpeak to Emelio, and give him above portion amounts. Once you confirm the amounts are correct, tell him it is perfect and he will give you a [[test kebab]] that the \"connoisseurs\" can try out. Give it to any one of the three, who will say it's brilliant and amazing. Speak to Emelio once more, and he will move on to the next phase of his plan: marketing the kebabs at the [[Fortis Colosseum]].\n\n===Guerilla marketing===\n[[File:Lelia chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nEmelio will give you another two test kebabs to bring to [[Lelia]], located in the southern room of the lobby area of the Colosseum. Though initially skeptical, she will change her mind upon tasting the kebab, and will mention a free advertising spot that opened up for the next contest. She will suggests you head in, eat one of the kebabs, and fight a young minotaur as part of your advertising act. Prepare for an encounter with a level 193 enemy.[[File:Meat and Greet - fighting minotaur.png|thumb|300px|Fighting the young minotaur.]]\nLelia will ask if you are prepared before sending you in. Once you accept the fight, you will be brought into the arena, as the [[Colosseum Announcer]] advertises Emelio's kebab. You eat the kebab as instructed, but the [[Minotaur (Meat and Greet)|young minotaur]] will mistakenly believe you ate minotaur meat rather than buffalo, and will attack you in anger. If you die or leave the arena during the fight, you can speak to Lelia to re-enter.\n\n==== The fight ====\nThe minotaur attacks with melee, can move at running speed, can path around the pillars, and is immune to binds and poison. It is weak to slash attacks. Protect from Melee will block all of its primary damage, but it can also use two special attacks:\n* When it shouts {{overhead|Moo!}}, it will launch a '''magic''' attack. To block, switch to [[Protect from Magic]] until after the attack hits you, then switch back to Protect from Melee.\n* When it shouts {{overhead|Moooooo!}}, it will attack 1 tick faster. Keep Protect from Melee on during this time.\n\nOnce the minotaur is defeated, Lelia will be satisfied, and will tell you to return to Emelio and inform him of the good impression the kebabs made on the crowd. Return to Emelio, who will give you a premium discount on any [[Varlamorian kebab]]s you buy.\n\n'''Congratulations! Quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Meat and Greet\n|image = [[File:Meat and Greet reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n* {{SCP|Cooking|8,000}} [[Cooking]] experience\n* Access to [[Emelio's Kebab Shop]]\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* Ali Morrisane does not give any clues on how to unlock the spice shipment.\n* Despite the first boss being named \"Dire Wolf Alpha,\" the concept of an \"alpha wolf\" has long been discredited by ethologists. The original concept came about based on a study of captive wolves by Dr. David Mech, who later disavowed his initial theory based on having flawed assumptions built in to his observations of a captive band of unrelated wolves.\n** In reality, while there are pack ''leaders'', [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMomcfChvR4 Mech has clarified] that there is no \"alpha\" wolf, and the pack leader role is not based on a fight for dominance, but multiple other factors, such as who is the breeding female.\n\n{{Meat and Greet}}"

King Arthur<br/>2. Sirs Gawain and Kay<br/>3. Sirs Lucan and Palomedes]]\nTo begin the quest, talk to [[King Arthur]] in [[Camelot]], east of [[Seers' Village]]. Ask him if you can join the Knights of the Round Table, and he'll suggest you complete a quest first to prove yourself. He'll tell you that his friend and mentor [[Merlin]] has been trapped in a crystal and can't be freed, and suggests that you ask the other knights if they have any ideas.\n\n===Gathering information===\n'''''Items required:''' None''\n\nGo talk to the other knights around [[Camelot]]. First speak to [[Sir Gawain]] (who can be found either roaming in the courtyard or inside the castle) and talk to him about [[Merlin]], being sure to discuss both options. He'll mention that perhaps [[Morgan Le Faye]] will be of help, since she created the enchantment. However, he does not know how to get into her [[Keep Le Faye|keep]].\n\nNext, talk to [[Sir Lancelot]] on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of Camelot Castle. Talk to him, and ask him if he has any idea on how to get into the Keep. He'll say that the only way to get into the [[Keep Le Faye]] is from the sea.\n\n===Infiltrating the keep===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[bucket of wax]] or an empty [[bucket]] (obtainable during quest).''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' Combat equipment, food, [[Varrock teleport (tablet)|Varrock teleport]], [[games necklace]], [[amulet of glory]] or [[Falador teleport (tablet)|Falador teleport]]''\n\nNow that you've got a lead, head down the road to the south to [[Catherby]]. Once in Catherby, just south of the [[bank]] on the dock, is a general store merchant named [[Arhein]]. Speak with him about his boat and ask where it is going. Then, run to the house north of the bank, and grab a bottle of [[insect repellent]] off the table. \n\nGrab some armour and go just north of the dock (between the bank and the [[Candle Shop]]), and you'll find a few crates against the back of the shop. Click on them to hide inside. There will be a bit of dialogue as workers come to pack you up and put you in the boat. After a while, you'll end up in the [[Keep Le Faye]]; when prompted, choose yes to climb out.\n\n===Freeing Merlin===\n[[File:Merlin's Crystal - Fighting Sir Mordred.png|thumb|220px|Fighting Sir Mordred.]]\nWatch out for the [[renegade knight]]s that are wandering around the castle, and run up the stairs to the very top floor. Up here, you'll find [[Sir Mordred]] (level 39); fight him, and just as you are about to defeat him, [[Morgan Le Faye]] will appear, begging you not to kill her son. Ask her about how to untrap Merlin. You must spare him in order to proceed. \n\nIn exchange for sparing him, she will finally tell you how to release [[Merlin]]. You will need a number of things to do so, noted below.\n\n:'''Note:''' Be careful not to interrupt the conversation, or you'll have to fight Sir Mordred again! Running out of prayer points will interrupt the dialogue.\n\n====Bat bones====\nThere are [[giant bat]]s (level 27) right outside the keep. Just go down the stairs to the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} to get outside and kill one. Note: after you leave the keep, you cannot get back in, and will need to hide in the crate in [[Catherby]] once again.\n\n====Black candle====\nIf you need a [[bucket of wax]], head north from the keep until you see a fenced-in area full of beehives (near the [[flax]] field). Pick up the [[bucket]] near the gate, then use the [[insect repellent]] on a hive to temporarily drive the bees away. Finally, then use the bucket on the hive to get some wax. If you have the bucket of wax already, you can simply return to [[Catherby]] by hiding in the crates on the docks at Keep Le Faye.\n\nTravel to the [[candle maker]], whose house is located west of the Catherby [[bank]]. Talk to him, and he'll tell you that he can make [[black candle]]s, but only if you bring him a bucket of wax. Talk to him again with the bucket of wax, and he will give you the black candle.\n\n====Excalibur====\n[[File:Merlin's Crystal - Lady of the Lake.png|thumb|220px|The Lady of the Lake]]\n'''''Items required:''' [[Bread]]''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' 2 [[Falador teleport (tablet)|Falador teleport tablets]] to get to and back from Taverley. Or use a games necklace and teleport to Burthorpe and run south.''\n\nThe sword is kept by [[The Lady of the Lake]]. To find her, go south-east of [[Taverley]] to the lake; the Lady of the Lake will be in the peninsula within. Talk to her and she'll tell you that she has the sword; however, she wants you to go to the jewellery shop in [[Port Sarim]] first.\n[[File:Merlin's Crystal - The beggar.png|thumb|left|220px|Talking to the beggar.]]\nAlong the way, grab a loaf of [[bread]], then head to Port Sarim. You can talk to [[Veos]] to travel to [[Port Piscarilius]], and run south to Hosidius to buy or steal bread. A [[pot of flour]] is purchasable in [[Wydin]]'s [[Food Store]] to bake your own. \n\nAs you open the door to the jewellery shop in [[Port Sarim]], a beggar will approach you, asking you for some food to feed his starving family. Give him the loaf of bread. When you do, he will then change into the Lady of the Lake, who was testing the purity of your spirit. Satisfied, she'll give you the sword [[Excalibur]].\n\n'''Note:''' Do not click anything but \"Click here to continue\" in the dialogue box, not even \"Talk to Lady of the Lake\", until you get the sword. If you do, it will reset her dialogue and you will need another piece of bread.\n\n====Chaos altar inscription====\n[[File:Merlin's Crystal - Chaos altar location.png|thumb|220px|The location of the chaos altar, in the south-east corner of Varrock.]]\nGo to [[Varrock]] and head to the [[Zamorak]] chaos temple in the south-east corner of the city. \"Check\" the altar to find the words needed: \"'''Snarthon Candtrick Termanto'''\". Make sure to click continue to complete the dialogue.\n\n'''Note:''' You '''must''' go read the words on the altar, or you won't be able to progress further through the quest.\n\n===Breaking the Crystal===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Excalibur]], [[black candle]], [[tinderbox]], [[bat bones]], [[food]] and a [[weapon]] (last 2 optional but recommended).''\n[[File:Merlin's Crystal - Thrantax the Mighty.png|thumb|220px|The demon.]]\nNow to free the wizard. First, head back to [[Camelot]], and locate the magical symbol on the north-east side of the castle's garden, just inside the fence. Light your black candle and ''drop'' the bat bones ('''be careful not to bury them''') in the circle. A demonic spirit named [[Thrantax the Mighty]] will appear, and you will be prompted to say the magic words: \"'''Snarthon Candtrick Termanto'''\". If you get it right, the spirit will obey you.\n\n:'''{{Colour|red|Warning}}:''' If you recite the wrong phrase, the spirit will attack you, and you will have to get a new black candle and try again. Be careful as the spirit is  level 92, with a max hit of 10, and can hit rather accurately.\n\nOnce the spirit is under your control, you'll make your request to free [[Merlin]], and the spirit will do as you wish. Go back inside Camelot Castle, and climb up the south-east ladder to the very top of the south-east tower. At the top, Merlin will be imprisoned in a blue crystal. Use [[Excalibur]] on the crystal, and it will shatter.\n\nHead back down and talk to [[King Arthur]] to finish the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Merlin's Crystal\n|image = [[File:Merlin's Crystal reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 6\n|rewards = *[[Excalibur]] (Required for [[Holy Grail]] quest.)\n* [[Antique lamp]] rewarding 1,000 XP in any skill of at least level 20 and 5 [[Kudos]] from [[Historian Minas]] after completion of the quest\n* Appointment with a [[title]] as a [[Knights of the Round Table|Honorary Knight of the Round Table]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Merlin's Crystal is required for the following:\n* [[Heroes' Quest]]\n* [[Holy Grail]]\n\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 26 August 2020\n|update = Mahogany Homes\n|change = Some grammatical errors have been corrected in the Merlin's Crystal quest.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 14 March 2005\n|update = Magic and Wilderness Updates\n|change = The location of the magic words has been changed from the Chaos Altar in level 12 Wilderness to the one found in Varrock.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Merlin's Crystal gives six [[quest points]], the most of any single quest (other than the compound quest, [[Recipe for Disaster]]), despite being relatively easy.\n*Merlin can be seen in his workshop prior to being released from his crystal if another player enters the workshop to interact with him.\n*Merlin can be seen trapped in the crystal even after completing the quest, this is during the same time as he's in his workshop.\n*If the player has a [[hammer]] in their inventory they will attempt to smash the crystal using the hammer with no effect.\n*Attempting to free Merlin without dealing with the spirit will result in message saying the crystal is being protected by a dark force.\n*The player will keep asking the knights in Camelot Castle about finding Excalibur even after player has obtained it and freed Merlin from the crystal.\n\n{{Merlin's Crystal}}"

It is the second quest to be made specifically for ''Old School RuneScape.'' After escaping from a house party in a spooky manor on a faraway island, [[Abigale]] seeks help for her injured boyfriend [[Hewey]] after being attacked by an unknown figure.\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Abigale]] (or [[Hewey]], who sits next to her) in the south-eastern corner of [[Lumbridge Swamp]], near the [[fishing spots]].\n|startmap = 3236,3155\n|difficulty = Novice\n|description = A woman cries as a man lays dying, desperately they beg you to stop a cryptic killer before their friends suffer a similar fate.\n|length = Short\n|items = * [[Bucket]] (obtainable during quest)\n*[[Tinderbox]] (obtainable during quest)\n*[[Knife]] (obtainable during quest)\n|kills = None\n|leagueRegion = <poem>\n{{RE|Misthalin}} — location requirement\n</poem>\n}}\n\n==Walkthrough==\n[[File:Misthalin Mystery - Sid dies.png|thumb|200px|Sid is murdered by the Killer.]]\nSpeak to [[Abigale]], south-east of Lumbridge Swamp, who will ask for the player's help after being attacked by an unknown figure on a nearby island. Board the [[rowboat (Misthalin Mystery)|rowboat]] south of them. Head through the gate, directly west is a fountain. Pick up a [[bucket (Misthalin Mystery)|bucket]] next to the fountain. Head north of the fountain to trigger a cutscene, where [[Sid]] is murdered by the [[Killer]]. Use the bucket on the [[a barrel of rainwater (Misthalin Mystery)|barrel of rainwater]], and search the barrel to obtain a [[manor key]].\n\n===Riddle 1===\n[[File:Misthalin Mystery - Tayten dies.png|thumb|left|200px|Tayten is murdered by the Killer.]]\nEnter the manor, pick up the [[knife]] on the [[table (Misthalin Mystery)|table]], and attempt to open the door with the red topaz (pink) knob up north. This will trigger another cutscene, where [[Tayten]] is murdered by the [[killer]] hiding in the wardrobe. Before returning to the wardrobe, the killer slides a [[Notes (Misthalin Mystery - 1)|note]] under the door. Pick it up and '''read it''' (You must read it in-order to progress).\n\n[[File:Misthalin_Mystery_-_painting.png|thumb|The painting slashed with a knife.]]\nThe riddle refers to a [[painting (Misthalin Mystery)|painting]] found in the adjacent room to the south-west. The painting is one with mountains, a blue river, and the sun on the horizon (on the east side of the room). Use the knife on it, and search it to find a [[Ruby key (Misthalin Mystery)|ruby key]]. The doorknobs on the doors throughout the mansion will indicate the appropriate key that opens them.\n\nOpen the eastern door, and take a [[tinderbox]] from the [[shelves (Misthalin Mystery)|shelves]]. Light all four [[candle (Misthalin Mystery)|unlit candle]]s in the room, and you will get a message the room is warm enough to dry the fuse attached to the [[barrel (Misthalin Mystery)|barrel of explosives]]. Then, use the tinderbox on the barrel next to the damaged wall. Exit the room to trigger the explosion.\n\n===Riddle 2===\n[[File:Misthalin Mystery - Lacey dies.png|thumb|200px|Lacey is murdered by the Killer.]]\nClimb over the wall, and head north of the manor to trigger another cutscene, where [[Lacey]] is tied up. The [[Killer]] will ask her the name of the vampyre who lives in South Misthalin, but players will be given a choice; none of options matter, so pick any (the correct answer is actually [[Count Check]], but if you say it, the Killer will kill Lacey for you interfering). She will die and the Killer will leave players [[Notes (Misthalin Mystery - 2)|another note]]. Pick it up and read it.\n\nIt's like music to my ears!\n<br/>The glorious sounds, spelling out your fate!\n\nThe riddle refers to the [[piano (Misthalin Mystery)|piano]] found in the north-eastern corner of the manor (music). You must enter the room through the damaged north-eastern wall. The Killer wants you dead - play the notes D-E-A-D on the piano, and search it to find an [[emerald key]].\n\n===Riddle 3===\n[[File:Misthalin Mystery - Mandy dies.png|thumb|left|200px|Mandy is murdered by the Killer.]]\nReturn inside the manor by climbing the damaged east wall, and open the door with the emerald doorknob where the first note was found. Attempt to open the kitchen doors where [[Mandy]] is found, and another cutscene will occur where she is apparently killed by the [[Killer]]. Once again, he will leave players [[Notes (Misthalin Mystery - 3)|a third note]]. Pick it up and read it.\n[[File:Misthalin Mystery - Gemstone switch panel.png|thumb|left|200px|The correct solution to the gemstone switch panel.]]\n\n<br/>'''H'''ear at first these word'''s'''.\n<br/>'''E'''ach murder you witness helplessly from start to en'''d'''.\n<br/>'''A'''s you fail to solve the final letters of this qui'''z'''.\n<br/>'''R'''azor sharp like a gemstone is the blade of my knif'''e'''.\n<br/>'''T'''he last sound you hear will be your scream's ech'''o'''.\n<br/>'''H'''eed that I will have the final word in this thrille'''r'''.\n\nThe riddle refers to the unlit fireplace in the eastern room, go out to the south-east room (the damaged wall room) and enter the north door (HEARTH). Use the [[knife]] on the unlit fireplace to reveal a panel of switches inside the hidden compartment. The correct solution corresponds to the final letter of each sentence. Therefore, to open the compartment, click the following in order (sdzeor): Sapphire - Diamond - Zenyte - Emerald - Onyx - Ruby. Search the fireplace once more to find a [[sapphire key]].\n\n===Showdown===\n{{Bug|Mobile players may not be able to click on or move the mirror during this part of the quest. Logging out and back in or unequipping your weapon may temporarily solve it.}}[[File:Misthalin Mystery - confronting Killer.png|thumb|left|200px|Showdown with the mysterious Killer.]]\nOpen the westernmost door, and a cutscene will occur where the player confronts the [[Killer]].\n\nHe will hide in wardrobes and throw knives. The player can know which wardrobe he's in by looking for a brief black shadow surrounding the wardrobe. The player must push the mirror into the row/column of the wardrobe and '''then push it at least once towards the wardrobe''' in order to have the mirror facing the wardrobe to reflect the thrown knife back to the killer (otherwise the mirror will deflect the knife, but not back at the killer). You need to get the knife to bounce back at the killer a few times before proceeding on with the quest.[[File:Misthalin Mystery - two Killers.png|thumb|200px|They were the two killers all along!]]\nAfter defeating the Killer, players will discover that the killer was [[Abigale]] all along! She complains about how adventurers always take all the glory from her when she tries to help others every year. However, another killer appears, and reveals himself as Abigale's boyfriend, [[Hewey]].\n[[File:Misthalin Mystery - Mandy kills Abigale.png|thumb|left|200px|Mandy finishes off Abigale with a [[Bandos godsword]].]]\nAfter basking in her glory, Abigale argues with Hewey over her selfishness, and in her anger, kills him. Pick up the [[killer's knife]] and attack Abigale.\n\nAs you attempt to leave the manor, Abigale attempts to kill you, but is stopped by [[Mandy]], who survived due to her having dextrocardia, a rare condition where her heart is located on the right side.\n\nSpeak to her outside the mansion to collect the rewards which require 3 empty inventory slots.

Players who completed the quest before the reward was added were told to speak with [[Mandy]] outside the mansion to receive the additional reward.\n* The mansion in this quest is based on [[Draynor Manor]].\n* No music plays at all during the quest. If you were to travel to the island and then log out and back in, you would find that your music player is playing nothing at all.\n* The quest plot is loosely based on the movie ''{{wp|Scream (1996 film)|Scream}}'' and it includes several references: the characters in the quest are named similarly to those in the movie and their examine texts include further allusions; both satirise horror clichés; and the quote \"What is your favourite scary quest?\" is a play on the opening scene of the movie.\n* There is a [[Bandos godsword (Misthalin Mystery)|Bandos godsword]] within the room where [[Mandy]] is, although there is currently no way the player is able to reach the weapon. Strangely, the godsword still has the 'Take' option.\n* If you wait long enough after the final encounter before trying to leave the room, both Killers will stand up. Attempting to talk to them will give you the message that they probably don't want to talk to you.\n* The quote \"I used to be an adventurer like you\" is a reference to ''{{wp|The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim}}'' and the subsequent [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-took-an-arrow-in-the-knee meme].\n* According to [[Mod Ash]], the island is \"still part of the Kingdom of Misthalin, but the bit they don't talk about, where even the guards daren't go\".{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1014629951734190080|date=4 July 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/4RfEo|archivedate=30 May 2020|quote=Kingdom of Misthalin, but the bit they don't talk about, where even the guards daren't go.}}\n* When Sid is murdered, he says \"I think I see the light\", a reference to a song by {{wp|Cat Stevens}} of the same name.\n* The player says \"Thank Saradomin\" in relief at the end, this is inconsistent with other quests where the player uses Guthix in exclamation instead.\n* Unlike normal [[fireplaces]], the fireplaces in the mansion cannot be used to cook raw food.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Misthalin Mystery}}"

The quest brings the player to [[Ape Atoll]], an island inhabited by civilised but unfriendly and high-level [[monkey]]s, in order to help [[Narnode Shareen]] track down his missing [[10th Squad]] military unit.\n\nA grandmaster-difficulty sequel to the quest called [[Monkey Madness II]] was released on [[6 May]] [[2016]]. \n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Talk to [[King Narnode Shareen]] in the [[Grand Tree]].\n|startmap = 2466,3495\n|difficulty = Master\n|description = The King of the northern Gnomes, Narnode Shareen, is once again in need of your help. He recently decided to send an envoy of his Royal Guard, the 10th squad, to oversee the decommissioning of the Gnome owned ship-building facilities on the eastern coast of [[Karamja]].\n\nIt has been quite some time since the 10th squad were dispatched and they have been deemed missing in action. It will be up to you, should you decide to help, to find out what fate befell the 10th squad and if possible, track them down.\n\nIf only it were so simple. Sinister forces have begun to spread through the Gnome hierarchy and threaten to unleash an unknown terror upon the world. Far across the land, the fires of vengeance are being stoked once again. Can you unravel the mystery behind the deception? Can you separate the truth from the lies? Can you decide for yourself what is real and what is not?\n|length = Long\n|requirements = * Completion of the following quests:\n** [[The Grand Tree]]\n** [[Tree Gnome Village]]\n* The ability to defeat a level 195 [[Jungle Demon]]\n|items = * A [[gold bar]]\n* An empty inventory slot\n* A [[ball of wool]]\n* [[Monkey bones]] or [[Monkey corpse|corpse]] from [[Karamja]] (obtainable during quest)\n|recommended = * {{SCP|Combat|65|link=yes}}\n* {{SCP|Prayer|43+}} [[Prayer]] '''highly recommended''', as the player will be attacked by numerous hard-hitting melee enemies in multicombat\n* [[Poison]] cures such as [[Antipoison|antipoison]] or [[Antidote++|antidote++]]\n* Energy-restoring items such as [[energy potion|energy]] and [[stamina potion]]s\n* [[Prayer potion]]s\n* A [[knife]] for free healing, as there are [[pineapple plants]] around Ape Atoll\n* High healing [[food]]\n* A [[lockpick]]\n* [[Weight-reducing clothing]]\n* Emergency teleport (a [[ring of life]] works as well)\n* [[Ardougne cloak 1]] or [[Ardougne teleport]]s [[File:Ardougne teleport (tablet).png]]\n* A mithril seed or tinderbox and logs to skip talking to Kruk and Garkor when bringing a monkey to King Awowogei.\n* A [[ring of dueling]] to bank quickly (the Ardougne cloak could be used instead, although it's somewhat further from a bank; the Battlefield of Khazard has a spirit tree, and the Gnome Stronghold has a bank and glider service)\n* 200,000 [[coins]] (if skipping the puzzle)\n|kills = * [[Jungle Demon]] ''(level 195)''\n|ironman = * {{SCP|Smithing|40|link=yes}} {{Boostable|yes}} (to make the gold bar if not dropped by a monster) or {{SCP|Magic|33|link=yes}} {{Boostable|yes}} (to telegrab a gold bar from [[Varrock west bank]] basement.)

All native creatures other than the level 5 [[Bird|birds]] will be [[aggressive]] towards you, regardless of your [[combat level]], whenever you're not wearing the [[monkey greegree]] made later in the quest. Players can hug the coasts of Ape Atoll when moving to avoid the poisonous snakes and spiders; some snakes may still be encountered this way, but players can simply wait for them to move.\n\nWhen going to the island, make sure to bring plenty of [[food]], [[Antipoison|antipoison potions]], and an emergency [[teleport]], in addition to any other required items. Switching off [[Auto Retaliate]] and utilising [[protection prayers]] will greatly improve your chances of survival.\n\nAt any point, you can teleport or flee from [[Ape Atoll]] to restock items without losing your progress. To leave the island by boat, simply talk to [[Lumdo]] in the landing area to go from Ape Atoll back to [[Crash Island]], and then talk to [[Waydar]] on Crash Island to go back to the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]]. To resume the quest, talk to [[Daero]] on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the [[Grand Tree]] to go back to the hangar, talk to Waydar in the hangar to go back to Crash Island, and finally, talk to Lumdo on Crash Island to return to Ape Atoll.\n\n== Monkey Business ==\n'''''Items required:''' three free inventory spaces.''\n\n'''''Items suggested:''''' ''some high-healing [[food]], a form of [[Poison#Curing poison|poison protection]], a [[lockpick]], and a [[knife]] (to prevent the player from needing to bank by cutting the island's [[Pineapple plant|pineapple]] plants for food).''\n\n=== Chapter 1 ===\n'''\"In which our hero/heroine finds himself/herself/themself drawn back into Glough's web of deception and deceit.\"'''[[File:King Narnode Shareen chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nTalk to [[King Narnode Shareen]] in the Tree Gnome Stronghold. He will tell you to investigate [[Glough]]'s old shipyard for any trace of the missing 10th Squad, and will give you the [[gnome royal seal]]. Bring this to [[Karamja]] (the ''\"Gandius\"'' option on the [[glider]] at the top of the [[Grand Tree]] will bring you nearby). ''If you do not have [[monkey bones]] (or a [[monkey corpse]]), kill a monkey while on Karamja to obtain some.''\n\nAfter arriving, enter the [[shipyard]] north of the glider landing site and speak with [[G.L.O. Caranock]], a gnome officer for the shipyard. He can be found in the building in the southern area, near the fence. He will act very suspiciously when spoken to, and advise you to return to the king.\n\nReturn to King Narnode, and he will give you [[Narnode's orders]] and tell you to speak to [[Daero]], the new head tree guardian. Daero can be found on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the Grand Tree, near [[Blurberry Bar]]. Go through all the chat options with Daero, and ensure you're ready for surviving Ape Atoll; when you're ready, tell him you're prepared to leave. He will then blindfold you and take you to an underground hangar. \n\nTalk to Daero in the hangar and he will introduce you to [[Waydar]], a gnome pilot. Waydar will task you with solving a \"reinitialisation\" puzzle, which is similar to the [[puzzle box]]es from [[Treasure Trails]]. If you have done these puzzles before, the sliding puzzle will be easy to complete; if not, see below for the solution, or bring 200,000 [[coins]] and go to [[Glough]], who resides in the same area he did during the [[Grand Tree]] quest. \n\n==== Waydar's Puzzle ====\nBegin solving the puzzle by clicking on the panel to the south-east by the southern glider. Players can take some [[spare controls]] from the nearby [[crate (Spare controls)|crate]] to view the solution, or simply consult the image below.\n\n[[File:Monkey Madness I - Spare controls.png|thumb|220px|The solution to the reinitialization puzzle.]]\n\nSolve the sliding puzzle as follows (with the piece numbers counting from the top left corner, moving left to right):\n\n{{Checklist|\n* Manoeuvre pieces 1, 2, and 3 into their proper positions in the upper left corner.\n* Position piece 4 in the upper right corner.\n* Position piece 5 under piece 4 (shuffle pieces 4 and 5 around with some others if they are not in the right order).\n* Slide piece 4 to the left and piece 5 up; the first row will now be done.\n* Repeat this process with second and then third rows, leaving the completed rows intact.\n* With rows 1-3 completed, the puzzle should now be solved in terms of 2-piece high columns.\n* Position pieces 16 and 21 next to each other, in that order, on the right-hand side of the bottom row. Slide the remaining tiles clockwise to put them in place.\n* Repeat this process with pieces 17 and 22, then with pieces 18 and 23.\n* Pieces 19, 20, and 24 should now be easily moved to their correct places.\n}}\n\nAfter completing the puzzle, talk to Daero, and then Waydar. The two of you will depart and then land on the aptly named [[Crash Island]], where the 10th Squad also crashed earlier. Ask the nearby sailor [[Lumdo]] to bring you to [[Ape Atoll]], and he will refuse due to conflicting orders from his sergeant, [[Garkor]]; since Lumbo says he will not take orders from you, talk to Waydar again instead (watch out for [[poisonous scorpion]]s just to his left, and '''do not''' click \"Travel\", as this will bring you back to the Grand Tree). After speaking with Waydar, speak with Lumdo once more, and he will now agree to take you to Ape Atoll.\n\n===Chapter 2===\n[[File:Monkey Madness I - Jail map.png|thumb|230px|The layout of the jail.]]'''\"In which our hero/heroine finds themselves engaging in severe quantities of monkey business.\"'''\n\n====First Contact====\n[[File:Aberab chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nOnce on the Atoll, start going west, sticking to the southern coastline until you reach a [[mahogany]] tree. From here, run north, avoiding the poisonous [[snake]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[jungle spider]]s. If you have the level to use it, activate [[Protect from Missiles]] as you travel north, as a volley of poisoned arrows will start pelting you as you come closer to the Ape Atoll gate. Once you get close enough to the entrance, you will be knocked out and placed in a prison.\n\nAfter waking up, you will find yourself in a cell guarded by [[Trefaji]] and [[Aberab]], two gorilla guards. Speak to [[Lumo]], one of the captured 10th Squad members, and then prepare to make your escape.\n\n==== Prison Break ====\n{{Map:Monkey Mapness}}Throughout this section and any time you are re-jailed, you will need to stay one square away from the northern cell wall (near the patrolling guards' path) if the guards are in front of it. If you're in their range, they will punch you for 10-20 damage. The guards follow a path, which is as follows: one of the guards will patrol the area twice, walking the length of the prison each time, and then leave to rotate shifts. Use the time that the guard moves '''away from your cell door''' to pick the lock. Once out, as the patrolling guard is walking out to switch with the one on standby, '''walk behind him to reach the exit.''' Be prepared to make several attempts.\n\nAfter successfully making it out of the building, travel north of the jail and then east to find [[Karam]], an assassin and member of the 10th Squad. Karam can be found in the bushes near the crafting shop ([[File:Crafting shop icon.png]]); he is mostly translucent and he can be difficult to spot, so look carefully. After finding him, speak with him to learn about the gnome mage [[Zooknock]].\n\nRefer to the map to the right for relevant locations during the quest. Be wary of all '''yellow''' dots, as they represent poisonous enemies (scorpions, snakes, and spiders), as well as aggressive monkey archers. When you are in the grass, the [[monkey archer]]s do not fire, but it's still a good idea to activate [[Protect from Missiles]] as a precaution.\n\nOnce you're ready, travel south, past the large door, while staying in the tall jungle grass. Past the door, go around the castle counter-clockwise until you're at the southern end, and from here, run south-east, until you are between a white building and the castle. To the east of that building is [[Garkor]], the Sergeant of the 10th Squad. Speak with him, and make sure to get all the way through the dialogue to the point where he tells you to go meet [[Zooknock]] in person.\n\n==== Supply Crates ====\n[[File:Monkey dentures detail.png|left|frameless|width=65x65]]Sprint west through the grass with Protect from Missiles on. Continue west (south of the buildings) in the grass until you reach the doorway to your north, marked on the map image above. Walk through the door to enter an enclosed area with a sleeping monkey guard, a banana crate, and a dentures crate.\n\nWhen inside this house, '''stay on the dark brown ground along the walls''', or you'll risk being sent back to jail. The spiders inside are poisonous, but their poison only hits 1 damage, so it might be helpful to save your anti-poisons for later in the quest. There are bananas in the south-western crates next to the ladder if the player needs a source of food. \n\nFrom the entrance, head east and then north, and search the stacked crates towards the middle of the room to acquire [[monkey dentures]]. The sleeping guard is a non-threat so long as you don't talk to him; otherwise, he will call for guards. \n\nAfter you have the dentures, search the [[Crate_(Temple_of_Marimbo_Dungeon_entrance)|south-easternmost crate]] and a prompt will appear, asking if you're ready to enter the area below. You will take 32.9% of your current hitpoints as fall damage if you drop down into the cavern when entering, so heal up if necessary before attempting it to avoid dying to the poisonous spiders. Your [[Agility]] level has a chance to negate this damage, so a [[summer pie]] or other Agility boost may help avoid fall damage during this section.\n\nOnce inside the cavern, '''travel to the north-west part of the area and search the crates''' to acquire the [[m'amulet mould]]. At this point, if you need to resupply, you can exit the city by going to the south-east corner of [[Marim]], running past the guards and the gravedigger, and climbing up the ladder. After climbing up, jump off the bridge, and go back to the boat to [[Crash Island]]. You can also teleport out.{{clear}}[[File:Monkey Madness I - M'amulet mould location.png|thumb|230px|The location of the M'amulet moulds.]]\n====The Light at the End of the Tunnel====\n'''''Items required:''' the [[monkey dentures]], the [[m'amulet mould]], and a [[gold bar]].''\n\n'''''Items suggested:''' 1-2 [[antipoison]] potions, 4+ [[energy potion|energy]], or [[Stamina potion|stamina potions]] (or other energy-restoring items such as the [[Explorer's ring 1|explorer's ring]]), 4+ [[prayer potion]]s, some [[food]], a [[plank]] (not necessary if traversing the traps correctly, but can be obtained during the quest anyway), and a [[one-click teleport]].''\n\n''Note: [[Strange fruit]] are handy for this section as they also cure poison. You will spend about 220% total run energy to traverse to the end of the tunnel at minimum weight, with no energy conserving mechanics; bring enough energy restore to accommodate.'' \n\n\n\nIt is '''highly recommended''' to teleport out and bank at this point. This section involves running past dozens of accurate [[Monkey Zombie|monkey zombies]] and [[Skeleton (Ape Atoll)|gorilla skeletons]] which can hit up to 7 and 12 respectively, all while inside a long and tight multicombat tunnel. [[File:ironman chat badge.png]] [[Ironmen]] or other accounts who don't have access to [[energy potion|energy]] or [[prayer potions]] are advised to use other [[Prayer items|prayer-boosting items]], in order to reduce prayer drain. Refer to the table below for the various threats faced throughout the dungeon.[[File:Ape Atoll Dungeon map.png|thumb|380px|[[Ape Atoll Dungeon]]]]\n[[File:Ape Atoll Dungeon.png|thumb|width=350x350|Players will need to run under rock structures when navigating the dungeon.]]\nWhen you're ready, travel back to the southern part of Ape Atoll from the Gnome Hangar(Speak to Daero in the Grand Tree). Once you arrive, head west of [[Lumdo]], and enter the [[Ape Atoll Dungeon|tunnel]] ([[File:Dungeon icon.png]]) below.\n\nAs soon as you enter, you'll see the screen will start to shake. Rumbling noises will play, and rocks will begin to fall; until you reach the tunnel, you are at '''constant''' risk of taking damage. Use the map to the right to navigate the dungeon.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dungeon threats and obstacles\n!Image\n!Name\n!Description\n!Action\n!Number\n|-\n|[[File:Monkey Zombie.png|center|200x200px]]\n|Monkey Zombie\n|Slow-moving zombie monkeys will attack you and hit up to 7 melee damage.\n|[[Protect from Melee]] [[File:Protect from Melee.png|frameless]]\n|30\n|-\n|[[File:Skeleton (Ape Atoll).png|center|200x200px]]\n|Monkey Skeleton\n|Accurate skeleton monkeys will attack you and hit up to 12 melee damage.\n|[[Protect from Melee]] [[File:Protect from Melee.png|frameless]]\n|17\n|-\n|[[File:Ape Atoll Dungeon Floor spikes, retracted.png|frameless|width=100x100]][[File:Ape Atoll Dungeon Floor spikes.png|frameless|width=147x147]]\n|Floor spikes\n|Spikes will launch from the ground and deal rapid damage if stood on, equal to 7.5% of your current health rounded up.\n|Avoid the dot clusters on the ground\n|30+\n|-\n|[[File:Ape Atoll Dungeon Rock trap.png|frameless|width=200x200]]\n|Rock trap\n|Two stalagmites will crash into you and deal rapid damage if you stand on the [[a rock|rock]] in the middle, equal to 20% of your current health rounded up.\n|Step on the square '''in front''' of the rock, and then run through by clicking the other side, to avoid all damage.

Be prepared to drink your prayer and energy restoring potions, as well as food, when necessary.\n\nAt the end of the tunnel, you will find the gnomes [[Zooknock]], [[Waymottin]] and [[Bunkwicket]]. Talk to Zooknock, and then use your [[m'amulet mould]], [[gold bar]], and [[monkey dentures]] on him and speak to him again. '''Make sure he gives you an [[enchanted bar]] before leaving the tunnel'''. Additionally, '''do not to use the m'amulet mould on Zooknock when you already have the enchanted bar''', as he will keep the mould and you will have to obtain another. Teleport out, and bank if necessary. If you have not gone through all the dialogue with Garkor you will not be able to use the items on him.{{clear}}\n\n====Amulet of Monkeyspeak====\n'''''Items required:''' the [[enchanted bar]], the [[m'amulet mould]], a [[ball of wool]], and five free inventory slots for the bananas.'' \n\n'''''Items recommended:''' 1-2 [[antipoison]] potions, a one-click teleport, and some food.'' \n\n'''''Note''': If you are going to do [[Recipe for Disaster]], bring a ranged or magic weapon to kill a monkey guard and archer to save time later.''\n[[File:Zombie monkey (item) detail.png|left|frameless|width=85x85]]\nAfter restocking, return to [[Ape Atoll]] and continue north-west until you are placed in the jail cell again. Escape the cell as before, then travel east towards the temple.\n\nYou must now descend through the trapdoor to the east in the temple (see map). Activate [[Protect from Melee]] before entering the temple to block attacks from the powerful [[monkey guards]]. \n\nMost of the guards can simply be run through, but the ones with beards near the trapdoor will act as walls, trapping you if they surround you. The easiest method to get past the bearded gorillas is to go upstairs, and then climb down the ladder on the east side to get close to the trapdoor. If you choose to walk to the ladder directly, make sure to wait until the guards walk away; players can hide in the north-east corner of the temple until there is enough room to descend. If you're surrounded by guards and can't move, teleport out immediately; if you're trapped near the ladder, go up the stairs and hop worlds. Note that the ladder near the trap door can only be climbed up from the EAST side.\n[[File:Wall of flame.png|thumb|width=429x429|The wall of flame.]]\nGo down the trapdoor while still praying against melee. Ignore the [[monkey zombie]]s (or kill one and pick up the bones if you want to do [[Recipe for Disaster]] later), and swiftly use the [[enchanted bar]] on the nearby [[wall of flame]]s to make an unstrung [[M'speak amulet (unstrung)|monkey amulet]]. Either travel back up the ladder or find a [[safespot]] to get away from the foes, and use the [[ball of wool]] with the unstrung amulet to create the full [[m'speak amulet]]. Be aware that if you ascend the ladder, you will be attacked and can be trapped as before, so ensure Protect from Melee is active.\n\n====A Monkey's Uncle====\n[[File:Monkey talisman detail.png|left|frameless|width=85x85]]\nHead to the building west of the jail, making sure to sneak through the grass. You'll see a banana garden that has a [[Monkey Child]] in it, which is being patrolled by [[The Monkey's Aunt]]. The aunt follows a predetermined path, which loops around the wooden house by the garden; do not enter the garden when the monkey's aunt is present, or she will call for guards to arrest you. Note that if you're caught, you can sometimes escape without being arrested by quickly climbing up the ladder in the building nearby before the monkeys reach you. Do not speak to [[The Monkey's Uncle]] upstairs, as he will also call the guards.\n\nWait for the aunt to walk away, then speak to the monkey child, and tell him that you are his uncle. After he reveals that he is supposed to collect 20 [[bananas]], search and pick five bananas from the nearby trees. The monkey cannot count, so you do not necessarily need 20, as long as you give him at least 5. Give him the bananas, then wait for a few moments in the corridor, and return to the monkey child when the aunt is away. Ask the child to lend you his [[monkey talisman]].\n\n=====Multiple talismans=====\nYou can obtain more than one talisman without dropping your current ones, so be sure to get an additional talisman for each [[greegree]] you want (four in total are needed for all quests; see below). You will need to speak to the monkey child again for each one, telling him you have lost the talisman, which will cause him to cry. Waiting for the aunt to pass by the child again will make the monkey child have another talisman available; Alternatively, you can switch worlds to potentially make the process go faster. If you talk to the child again before the aunt has passed by, you will get the message \"The monkey child is too busy crying...\"\n\nNote that after you make your first greegree, talismans can be purchased from [[Tutab's Magical Market]] for 1000 [[coins]]. Tutab will not open his shop unless you are in monkey form.\n\n=====Multiple greegrees=====\nFor the [[Recipe for Disaster]] quest, you will need an additional three greegrees (four in total). Each of these requires one talisman, for a total of four talismans plus their respective monkey bones if making all talismans in one go. You will save yourself several trips if you obtain all of these materials before going to [[Zooknock]] in the next section. You must kill one of each of the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Greegrees\n!Type\n!Bones/corpse from\n!Quest\n|-\n|{{Ilink|Karamjan monkey greegree|txt=Karamjan monkey|pic=Karamjan monkey greegree}}\n|[[File:Monkey.png|frameless|width=138x138]]\n|Monkey Madness I\n|-\n|{{Ilink|Ninja monkey greegree|txt=Ninja monkey|pic=Ninja monkey greegree (medium)}}\n|[[File:Medium ninja monkey.png|frameless|width=135x135]]\n|[[Freeing King Awowogei]]\n|-\n|{{Ilink|Gorilla greegree|txt=Gorilla|pic=Gorilla greegree}}\n|[[File:Monkey Guard.png|frameless|width=76x76]]\n|[[Freeing King Awowogei]]\n|-\n|{{Ilink|Zombie monkey greegree|txt=Zombie monkey|pic=Zombie monkey greegree (big)}}\n|[[File:Large zombie monkey.png|frameless|width=151x151]]\n|[[Freeing King Awowogei]]\n|}\n'''Note''': Some monkeys will have large and small variants; both will work for the quests, and merely change the size of your monkey form.\n\n==== Making the greegrees ====\nOnce you have all of the required bones (or monkey corpse) and talismans, you must run through the tunnels again, bringing your items to Zooknock. Travel through the tunnel for a second time, and when you reach the end, '''use''' the [[monkey talisman]] and all monkey bones (or corpses) on [[Zooknock]]. '''''{{Colour|red|Warning: the left-click option for all types of bones is buried, so make sure that you right-click on the items and select the \"use\" option.}}'''''\n\nAfter a brief delay and conversation, you will get a greegree corresponding to the bones you used on him. To make another greegree, you have to first talk to him again and ask him if he can make another. '''If you cancel the conversation accidentally, ask how to make the monkey talisman and it will resume.''' If for some reason this doesn't work, try the [[drop trick]] with your previous greegrees, and go through the dialogue again. After all desired greegrees are made, bank or stock up as needed, and return to [[Ape Atoll]].\n\n===Chapter 3===\n'''<nowiki>''In which our hero/heroine finds himself/herself contending with life as a monkey.''</nowiki>'''\n\n'''''Items required:''' [[Karamjan monkey greegree]], [[m'speak amulet]], 1 free inventory space, and a method of reaching [[Ardougne]].''\n[[File:Awowogei chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nIn this chapter, you will be required to speak with [[Awowogei|King Awowogei]] and retrieve a monkey from the [[Ardougne Zoo]]. If you need to bank, you can skip to retrieving the monkey in Ardougne, and then speak with Awowogei when you return to Ape Atoll (steps 1-3).\n\nWield the [[monkey greegree]] to become a monkey (currently only the Karamjan monkey greegree will work for transformation). In this form, you will not be approached or attacked by any of the monkeys or wildlife on the island, and you cannot engage in combat. As a monkey, return to [[Garkor]] and speak with him; then, with the m'speak amulet equipped, talk to the [[Elder Guard]] near Garkor. The guard will tell you to speak with [[Kruk]].\n\nFrom the guard, run west until you pass the main gate into [[Marim]] and have reached the Western shore of Ape Atoll (do not exit the gate). Head slightly south and follow the ground path up the western hill, then climb up the bamboo ladder at the top and cross the bamboo bridge. Climb down the ladder on the east side and speak to Kruk. After the conversation ends, he will conveniently take you back to [[King Awowogei]].\n\nSpeak to Awowogei and offer an alliance, and he will ask you to rescue a monkey from the [[Ardougne Zoo]]. Make sure you have an open inventory space, and then teleport out and make your way to Ardougne.[[File:Monkey Madness I - G.L.O. and Awowogei.png|thumb|300x300px|Caranock, Waydar and King Awowogei plotting.]]\n\n====Monkey See, Monkey Zoo====\nOnce in [[Ardougne]], head to the south-west corner and enter the zoo. Wield the [[greegree]] inside the zoo area to become a monkey, and then speak to the [[Monkey minder]], who will place you in the cage. Speak with a [[Monkey (Monkey Madness I)|monkey]] (the only one with a \"Talk\" option), and it'll hop into your inventory; then, unequip the greegree and speak to the Monkey minder again. He will be confused and let you out.\nYou will now need to travel '''by foot''' to the [[Gnome Stronghold]], before climbing up to the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} and talking to [[Daero]] to travel back to Ape Atoll as usual. While the monkey is in your inventory, you cannot use any form of teleportation (including [[random events]]), as doing so will remove the monkey from your inventory, requiring you to re-obtain it from the zoo.\n:''Extra: Your new monkey friend will supply you with some humorous dialogue, and examining him will get you poked. If you have any [[bananas]] in your inventory, he will most likely eat them. There is also a 1/256 chance that he will give you a [[clue scroll (medium)]] if you use bananas on him directly.

''(If you have spoken before, simply speak to the Elder Guard to be let in; if not, refer to the section above).'' The monkey will automatically leave your backpack after speaking to Awowogei, and the king will consider an alliance.\n\nSpeak with Garkor to begin Chapter 4.\n===Chapter 4, \"The Final Battle\"===\n'''''Required items:''' [[Greegree]], food, an antipoison, and [[combat equipment]] to defeat a level 195 [[Jungle Demon]]''\n[[File:Garkor chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nSpeak with Garkor one more time (as a human or monkey) to receive a [[10th squad sigil]]. '''''Do not equip it until you are ready for the final battle'''''. Make sure to hold onto the sigil, as if you lose it, Garkor will send you to [[Waymottin]] at the end of [[Zooknock]]'s tunnel to reclaim it.[[File:Monkey Madness I - Jungle Demon fight.png|thumb|350px|The 10th squad and the player fight the demon.]]Bank in preparation for the [[Jungle Demon]] fight, and ensure you have full [[prayer points]] and health. When you are ready to fight, wear the sigil (you can do this from anywhere in RuneScape; no need to return to Ape Atoll), and you will be promptly teleported to the Jungle Demon's arena. Activate Protect from Magic '''''before''''' teleporting, and drink any necessary [[potions]]. '''You will lose your greegree when you teleport if your inventory is full.'''\n\nUpon landing in the arena, you'll be confronted by a level 195 Jungle Demon which can hit up to 32 with both magic and melee. Protection prayers reduce all damage to zero; as such, if the player stands out of melee range, the fight can be completed by simply leaving on Protect from Magic and attacking the demon with Magic or Ranged. Note that the demon's melee attack can hit you even if you're two squares away, similar to a halberd; ensure you're three or more squares away to avoid it. Additionally, '''standing still''' once you are teleported to the arena will keep a distance between you and the Demon, who will not move until you do, although it will still attack you with Magic.\n\nThe 10th Squad gnomes will be nearby to assist with the fight, but '''you must deal the final blow to the demon yourself.''' If the gnomes deal the final strike, he will heal around 20 percent of his health (anywhere from 12%-25%); when the demon reaches 1 hitpoint, there will be a period where the gnomes stop attacking, so use this window to deal the final blow yourself.\n\nThe demon is weakest to Ranged, although Magic is fairly effective. Players should focus on their combat style with the highest damage. Note that the [[dwarf multicannon]] is effective against the demon, allowing [[pure]] accounts to kill him without gaining any [[Hitpoints]] experience; additionally, despite being from the jungle, he is not immune to poison. Melee is not recommended, but players looking to use melee combat will benefit from using rings of recoil, as the demon's melee attacks hit very accurately.\nThere is a [[safespot]] in the arena, across a bridge on the outside edge. When you run to the safespot, he will make his way to the bridge, but won't be able to fit over it, allowing you to easily attack him with Magic or Ranged while leaving up Protect from Magic.\n==Finishing up==\n[[File:Diamond detail.png|left|frameless|width=57x57]]\nOnce the Jungle Demon is slain, speak to Garkor, who is indicated by an arrow. He will tell you to speak to Zooknock; speak to Zooknock nearby to get the option to be teleported back to Ape Atoll. If players decline the offer and stay, they are free to explore the [[Banana plantation (Ape Atoll)|banana plantation]], but Zooknock will leave, requiring players to speak to [[Bonzara]] instead if they want to be teleported. He can be found in the crack at the base of the statue.\n*'''{{Colour|red|Warning}}:''' The gnomes will teleport you into the jungle on Ape Atoll. It is advised to simply teleport off of the island as quickly as possible; players wishing to stay on the island should immediately equip their greegree after being teleported by the gnomes.\nEscape the island however you like, either through the main gates as a monkey, with any form of teleport, or by jumping off the bridge in the south-east part of the city, and go back to the [[Gnome Stronghold]].\n\nSpeak with [[King Narnode]] in the [[Grand Tree]] to finish the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete! '''\n\nThe king will then redirect you to [[Daero]] for your training as a new 10th squad member, so go have a chat with Daero for the experience rewards.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Monkey Madness I\n|image = [[File:Monkey Madness I reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 3\n|rewards = *10,000 [[Coins]]\n*3 [[Diamond]]s\n*Speaking to [[Daero]] after the quest gives the choice of either, 35,000 [[experience]] in {{SCP|Attack}} [[Attack]] and {{SCP|Defence}} [[Defence]] and 20,000 [[experience]] in {{SCP|Strength}} [[Strength]] and {{SCP|Hitpoints}} [[Hitpoints]] '''OR''' 35,000 [[experience]] in {{SCP|Strength}} [[Strength]] and {{SCP|Hitpoints}} [[Hitpoints]] and 20,000 [[experience]] in {{SCP|Attack}} [[Attack]] and {{SCP|Defence}} [[Defence]].

He will tell you that [[Glough]] has escaped, and you will be instructed to search for clues of his whereabouts, starting with his house. Glough's house is located just south-east of the [[Grand Tree]]. Climb up the ladder and then climb up the tree on the other side of the house. Now, right click the tree branch, and select 'Investigate'. You will receive a [[handkerchief]] that has the initials 'A.A.' embroidered on it.\n\nYou will then need to speak to his girlfriend [[Anita]], located in her house up the most north-western staircase in the [[Gnome Stronghold]]. She will be in tears. Ask her what's wrong, and she will begin telling you that she is worried Glough may be seeing another woman. Tell her that Glough might be in trouble, and that you may be able to help her. She tells you that she heard whispering upstairs in his house but couldn't reach the higher level.\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - Glough's house.png|thumb|220px|The player in Glough's house.]]\nReturn to Glough's house, and climb up the tree twice to reach the additional level of his house. Investigate the [[Gnome statue (Monkey Madness II)|gnome statue]] to activate a hidden switch. Now, search the [[cupboard (Monkey Madness II)|cupboard]] to receive a [[book of spyology]]. Read through it — the book mentions a method to reveal text on a document encrypted with spycraft. Search the [[Gnome crates (Monkey Madness II)|crates]] to the north-west to receive a [[brush]], and investigate the [[Fire remains (Monkey Madness II)|fire remains]] to receive a [[mysterious note]]. Follow these steps in order to decrypt the note:\n#Use your [[pestle and mortar]] on the [[lemon]] to apply it to the note. Caution, left clicking the lemon first will consume it.\n#Use the note on the nearby [[Candles (Monkey Madness II)|candles]] (or a [[lit candle]]).\n#Use your pestle and mortar on the [[grapes]] to apply it to the brush.\n#Finally, use the [[juice-coated brush]] on the mysterious note to receive a [[Scrawled note (Monkey Madness II)|scrawled note]], which is written in [[Ancient Gnomish]]. Read the note.\n\nIf you don't already have the [[translation book]], return to King Narnode, and talk to him to obtain the book. Use the book on the note before speaking to the king again. (You may already have this book in your bank from [[The Grand Tree]] quest.) He will suggest you speak to the book's author, who is Anita. Go back to her, and ask her to translate it for you. She will give you a [[translated note]]. Read it, and return to King Narnode, who discovers it was [[Assistant Le Smith]] who helped Glough escape.\n\nTalk to [[Assistant Lori]] south of Glough's tree and ask who he is. He will tell you that he is Le Smith's replacement, and that he does not know what happened to him, and recommends that you ask [[Auguste]] about it. Fly to [[Entrana]] using the balloon. This requires one [[regular log]]. '''You must bank all of your weapons and armour at this point, as you cannot bring them to Entrana.''' If you wish to save time getting back to the Gnome Stronghold, bring one [[magic log]] with you as well so that you can return quickly via balloon. Talk to [[Auguste]] who will explain that Le Smith was lost while attempting to travel to [[Ape Atoll]] via air balloon.\n\nReturn to King Narnode, who will tell you to travel to Ape Atoll, to speak with [[Garkor]].\n\n==Chapter II==\n{{Needed|[[M'speak amulet]], [[monkey talisman]], [[Ninja monkey greegree (medium)|ninja monkey greegree]] or [[ancient gorilla greegree]], [[light source]].

Equip your [[M'speak amulet]] and [[ninja monkey greegree]] or [[ancient gorilla greegree]] and head to [[Garkor]] on the eastern side of the island. Speak to Garkor who will tell you to speak to [[King Awowogei]]. Talk with Awowogei, and ask him about military plans. He will explain that he will not speak to anyone other than [[Kruk]]. Report back to Garkor. You will need to find and kill Kruk to create a [[greegree]] from his remains to disguise yourself as him.\n\nHead onto the hill west of the main gate to where the [[monkey archer]]s are; one of them should have a talk option. Talk to the monkey, and ask him where Kruk is. He will tell you that he has been disappearing from his post a lot lately, and that he would start tracking him from the bottom of the hill. Head back down the hill, and you should see some footprints. Follow them to a trapdoor hidden in long grass, just south of the northern transport icon on the minimap.\n\nOpen the trapdoor and enter [[Kruk's Dungeon]]. The greegree will lose its effectiveness when you enter the cave and \"wrench itself from your hands.\" '''If your inventory is full, the greegree will drop to the ground when you enter.''' [[Kruk]] is located beyond the [[monkeybars (Kruk's Dungeon)|monkeybars]] north of the entrance, but as the player cannot use them yet they will have to traverse one of two lengthy routes to Kruk.\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - Kruk's dungeon entrance.png|thumb|250px|Location of the trapdoor.]]\n\nBelow is a map of [[Kruk's Dungeon]]:\n[[File:Kruk's Dungeon map.png|600px|centre]]\n===The Agility Route===\nPlayers with around level 70 [[Agility]] or higher are recommended to take this route, as it is less dangerous. However, players '''must''' be ready to activate the correct protection prayer quickly whenever they fail an obstacle, as they will fall to the lower floor filled with many hard-hitting monkeys - either [[Maniacal monkey|maniacal monkeys]] or [[Maniacal Monkey Archer|maniacal monkey archers]], depending on where the player falls. Make sure to bring a light source, as the lower floor is dark.\n\nThis section of the dungeon will consist of many agility obstacles. The overall layout is predetermined but there is only one correct path to take, which is randomized for each player. You will often have to find the correct route by trial and error. If, when failing an obstacle, the message {{Colour|Red|Something about this route feels wrong...}} appears in the chatbox, then that path has a 100% fail rate for you. Whenever this occurs, remember which obstacle it occurred on and try another one next time. If \"Tile highlighting\" is enabled in the settings, you can mark tiles to indicate the correct path by using shift and right click.\n\nThere are five holes (labelled 1-5 on the map) to the lower level. When players fall and climb back up from the lower level, they will reappear at the last hole they passed, so they act similarly to checkpoints.\n\nFollow this path:\n\n* To start the route, head south and then east from the entrance. '''If you fall to the lower level, use [[Protect from Melee]] immediately.'''\n* You will come across [[Dodgy ground]]. All you have to do is to follow the flat-looking parts of the ground, and avoid the parts with an \"X\" pattern, which the player will fall through.\n* Continue eastwards past the obstacles (towards Hole 2 on the map), using trial and error to determine the right path to take.\n* You will reach a huge room filled with dodgy ground. Carefully navigate to the crevice on the east side and enter it to find a chest. Unlock it (right-click) and search the chest to obtain the [[Bronze key (Monkey Madness II)|bronze key]]. Now navigate back over the dodgy ground to the north side of the room and unlock the door with the key (if you die or teleport out past this point, the door will not remain open so you will have to reobtain the key). You will arrive at Hole 3.\n* '''In the section after the door, use [[Protect from Missiles]] if you fall.''' The lower floor in this area also contains many dead ends, so it can be helpful to consult the map to avoid getting lost in it. Additionally, you will continue taking damage for a few ticks after exiting the lower floor if not praying. To progress, head northwards through the maze of obstacles. Note that the correct route through this area may be very long and circuitous, so it is important to remember exactly which obstacles you have failed on.\n* You will emerge at a corridor at the north end of the dungeon. Head west to Hole 5. '''If you fall here, use [[Protect from Melee]].''' Note that there are falling rocks that deal damage, and some melee-using maniacal monkeys here, so pray melee until you pass them.\n* Navigate one last set of obstacles to the south-west. Near the end of this section, before the final dodgy ground, there is a strange wall (marked 'Shortcuts' on the map). '''Make sure to investigate this wall to open a shortcut to the entrance!''' Otherwise you may have to traverse the entire dungeon again. Past the final dodgy floor is Kruk's room.\n\n[[File:Bronze_key_(MM2)_location.png|thumb|The location of the chest that possesses the bronze key]]\n\n===The Tanking Route===\n{{Needed|A [[slash weapon]] to break webs and a [[pickaxe]] to clear rocks.\n|recommended=Good [[tanking]] [[equipment]]}}\n\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_crossing_Kruk's_dungeon.png|thumb|220x220px|A player navigating through obstacles in Kruk's dungeon.]]\n\nThe dungeon is in an oval sort of shape, so it is pretty straightforward to navigate your way through it. The tunnels are all [[multi-combat]]. There are many [[aggressive]] monkeys, in addition to the odd [[scorpion]] or [[snake]].\n\n*The monkeys can deal very high damage quickly, even with good [[tanking equipment]]. It is recommended to use [[Protect from Missiles]] as the [[Maniacal Monkey Archer|monkey archers]] have a much longer range and deal just as much damage as the melee ones.\n*For your consumables if taking the tanking route, it is best to bring [[Saradomin brew]]s to get as much healing as possible. [[Super restore]]s are not needed unless you are planning to kill Kruk on the same run.\n*Runes for [[Blood Burst]] or [[Blood barrage|Barrage]] are useful to heal off the maniacal monkeys if you need to.\n\nMake your way east through the dungeon slashing webs and mining rocks. After a while, you will be at a crossroads, one route heading north and another heading south-east. It is recommended players try the south-eastern route first. If you cannot slash this web, skip the next paragraph.\n\nIf you are able to slash through this web, search the two chests in this room that must be unlocked through their right-click option. Only one of the two chests will open, the other one will give a message indicating it can't be opened. Search this chest to receive a [[combat scratched key]]. Continue further east and then north until the path meets up with the alternate route. Continue reading after the next paragraph, where the two routes meet back up.\n\nIf you were unable to slash through the webs in the southern room, head into the northern (inner) route. This will lead you to a room containing two chests, of which only one can be unlocked using its right-click option; the other one will indicate it can't be opened through a message in the chat box. Search the opened chest to receive a [[combat damaged key]]. Slash the web to the east and meet up with the other route.\n\nAfter meeting back up with the other route, continue north and pass through another big room. The route for the next section will be entirely determined by the key you obtained earlier. If you obtained a \"combat '''scratched''' key\", take the eastern route. If you obtained a \"combat '''damaged''' key\", take the western route.\n\nThere are some traps in this section that can be '''completely ignored''' if taking the correct route based on the key, by quickly running past them on the route. These traps are present in this section:\n* The dart traps can be disarmed for 28 [[Thieving]] experience, but do not seem to shoot players on the correct route unless the player stands still in their line of sight for multiple seconds. If shot, the darts will deal fairly rapid damage and may inflict [[poison]] starting at 8 damage.\n* The floor blade traps will occasionally raise up, dealing fairly low damage and pushing the player out. These deal less damage than the maniacal monkeys around it, so it is highly recommended to just run past them instead of waiting for the right timing.\n* The spinning blade trap can also be disarmed for 28 [[Thieving]] experience. Disarm the trap, or run past it to take a small amount of damage (up to 6, based on current hitpoints).\n\nAfter this section, open the door with your key. It is also possible (but highly discouraged) to pick the lock on the door to get 50 [[Thieving]] experience, however this has a chance of inflicting '''poison dealing 6 damage'''. After the door, there will be several more of the same traps. Simply keep running north and then west until you meet up with the agility route from here.\n\n{{color|red|'''Warning!'''}} There is currently a glitch that makes it possible to get stuck between the spinning blade trap and the eastern (combat scratched) door, without the ability to go back past the spinning blade trap, if attempting to take the north-easternmost route despite not having the proper key for that route. Players who have the [[Combat damaged key]] should make sure to take the '''western''' route. If you happen to get stuck, you cannot progress and need to teleport out and reset. The lock on the door can be picked to find a safespot if needed for a home teleport.\n\n===Reaching Kruk===\nThe two paths converge at the north end of the dungeon. Continue west, where there is another vine serving as the final \"checkpoint\". There are three [[maniacal monkeys]] near it, so [[pray melee]] until they cannot reach you. The path will then divide into a western and eastern route which both end in a separate final wave of dodgy ground. '''After the last obstacle (vine or wall support) and before stepping onto the dodgy ground before Kruk's lair,''' investigate the nearby wall as indicated on the map to unlock a shortcut back to the entrance.\n\nAfter searching the wall, move on past the dodgy ground, or go to the bank to re-stock for the battle against [[Kruk]]. Use the shortcut when you return to skip to the end of the cave. The cavern entrance just south of the dodgy ground will lead to Kruk's chamber.\n\n===Killing Kruk===\n{{Needed|Combat equipment to kill [[Kruk]].\n|recommended=[[Food]],  [[prayer potion]]s, and an emergency teleport.}}\n{{Instance}}\n'''{{Colour|Red|Warning:}}''' [[Kruk]] can be very difficult to kill, even for the well-prepared.\n\nWhen you enter the room with [[Kruk]], there will be some short dialogue, after which Kruk will attack. Kruk uses a combination of [[melee]] and [[ranged]] attacks. His ranged attack is stronger, with a max hit of '''37''', so turn on '''[[Protect from Missiles]]''' when you attack him. '''Keep your health above 40 at all times, as Kruk can still hit up to 33 with melee.''' Kruk has no particular weakness to any attack style. When attacking Kruk, the best method is to attack with range using [[stamina potions]]. This is similar to fighting [[Commander Zilyana]]. Attack and run away, staying out of melee range. This method reduces the amount of high hits from Kruk. Keep in mind you will still be hit by certain ranged attacks. It may be optimal to pray [[Eagle Eye]] and [[Steel Skin]], or [[Rigour]], in addition to Protect from Missiles. Given high enough combat, Kruk can be easily meleed without [[flinching]] with [[Protect from Melee]] and [[Piety]], while only using a few [[sharks]] to be safe. However, lower levelled players are recommended to flinch Kruk. To trap him, stand next to a cave wall in such a manner that there is a cave wall directly '''north''' or '''south''' of you, with Kruk standing diagonally from you. Attack Kruk everytime his health bar disappears and directly step back to the original square, in order to prevent him from damaging you back.\n[[File:Flinching Kruk.png|alt=Kruk Flinching Location|thumb|224x224px|Sample location to flinch Kruk]]\n\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_fighting_Kruk.png|thumb|220x220px|The player faces Kruk.]]\nAfter killing Kruk, take [[Kruk's paw|his paw]] and exit the dungeon through the rope west of the chamber. This rope will lead you back up in the ruined building where you hid from the [[monkey's aunt]] during [[Monkey Madness I]]. You now need to make a [[Kruk monkey greegree]] with his paw and a [[monkey talisman]]. You must navigate through the [[Ape Atoll Dungeon|tunnel]] you originally trekked through during the original [[Monkey Madness I]]. The fastest way to reach the tunnel is via the [[Arceuus spellbook|Arceuus Spellbook's]] [[Ape Atoll Teleport (Arceuus)|Ape Atoll teleport]]; if you are unable to cast the teleport, an [[Ape atoll teleport (tablet)|Ape Atoll teleport tablet]] can be purchased from the Grand Exchange.\n\n'''Note:''' Wearing a [[greegree]] will prevent you from being attacked by the undead monkeys and [[spider]]s inside (an [[anti-poison]] or similar will make you immune to spike damage), but falling rocks will still damage you. It is highly advised to bring a [[stamina potion]], [[super energy potion]]s and [[food]] when going to [[Zooknock]].\n\nSpeak to Zooknock, and talk to him about the quest you are on - he will create the Kruk monkey greegree for you. He will warn you that he cannot be certain how taking his form will affect you, as Kruk was quite powerful before his death. Teleport out of the dungeon once you get the greegree, equip it, and return to [[Awowogei]]. He will reveal that the monkeys are planning another attack with the help of the [[Gu'Tanoth]] [[ogre]]s and the generals of the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]]. With this information, '''talk with [[Garkor]]''' to finish Chapter II.\n\n==Chapter III==\n\n===Defeating Kob and Keef===\n\n{{Needed|[[Weapon]], [[armour]] to kill [[Kob]] and [[Keef]], and 20 [[coins]] (unless the player has 71 Agility).|recommended=[[Trollheim teleport]] or [[stony basalt]], [[ring of dueling]], [[Yanille]] or [[Castle Wars]] teleports for fast access to [[Gu'Tanoth]], some [[food]].}}\n\n====Kob====\n\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Fighting_Kob.png|thumb|220x220px|The player challenges Kob to a deathmatch.]]\nHead to the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]]. Run to the south-westernmost room on the main level and challenge [[Kob]] to a deathmatch. It is '''highly recommended''' to use the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer before speaking to him and accepting his challenge, as he can hit up to 57. However, Kob can still hit through Protect from Melee with a max hit of 28. Players should either [[pray melee]] or safespot Kob by running out to the door and using [[Ranged]], [[Magic]], or a [[halberd]], as he will not be able to reach you. When he is defeated, Kob will beg for mercy and agree to not help the monkeys.\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Fighting_Keef.png|left|thumb|220x220px|The player and Keef fight to the death.]]\n\n====Keef====\n\nYou will need to go to [[Gu'Tanoth]] and find [[Keef]], who can be found near the other [[city guard]]s past all the bridges (where you solved the riddle a guard gave you in the [[Watchtower Quest]]). Bring 20 [[coins]] to pass the bridges again. Players with level 71 Agility can use the shortcut near Keef to save time.\n\nChallenge Keef to a deathmatch; Keef has a high max hit of 47 and can hit through [[protection prayers]], albeit at a reduced output. As Keef is a large [[NPC]], you can use the nearby tree as a safespot by positioning Keef north of the tree (west of the shortcut) and yourself south-west of the tree. '''Be sure to activate Protect from Melee before you enter the dialogue with him.''' When Keef nears death, he will beg for mercy and agree not to help the monkeys.\n\n===Back in Ape Atoll===\n{{Needed|[[Kruk greegree]] and [[M'speak amulet]].\n|recommended=[[Ape atoll teleport]], [[weight-reducing clothing]], [[Energy potion|energy]], [[super energy]], or [[stamina potion]]s, [[hammer]], [[chisel]], [[food]].}}\n\n====Assistant Le Smith====\n\nReturn to Garkor to tell him that the [[ogre]]s and [[troll]]s have agreed not to help the monkeys.\n[[File:Assistant_Le_Smith_location.png|thumb|220x220px|A possible location of Assistant Le Smith.]]\nHe will tell you to go and look for [[Assistant Le Smith]], who can be found somewhere on [[Ape Atoll]] on the rooftops or other high places within the city. There are four possible locations:\n* On top of the bridge that connects the two watchtowers of the main gate.\n* Top floor (up two ladders) of the broken building next to the [[Monkey Child]] and [[The Monkey's Aunt]].\n* Top floor of the jail. To access the top floor, climb the ladder by [[Solihib's Food Stall]], then walk northwards and climb the ladder on the back of the wall of the room with the bamboo bed (this ladder is not marked on the mini map).\n* Top floor of the building west of the [[Magic Stall]]. To reach him here, first make your way towards the building marked with a [[bank]] icon ([[File:Bank_icon.png|($)]]) on the map. Climb up two ladders to the top floor, pick-lock the jail door, and then simply run southwest across the bamboo bridges.\n\nSpeak with Le Smith by telling him that you were going to ask him the same question followed by asking him why and about the ships, and he will inform you that the monkeys are constructing a fleet of ships on the west coast of Ape Atoll.\n\nTalk to Garkor before heading west to the north-western coast of Ape Atoll. While wielding [[Kruk's greegree]], speak with the monkey by the rowboat located on the north-western corner of Ape Atoll. He will take you to the platform.\n\n====Monkey Gear Solid====\n\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_airship_platform_map.png|left|thumb|A labelled map of the airship platform.]]\n[[File:Airship_platform.png|thumb|220x220px|The airship platform.]]\nNow, on the platform, you will be transformed back into human form. You will have to collect six [[Satchel (Monkey Madness II)|satchels]], fill them with explosives, and then place the charges around the platform.\n\nGuards are all over the platform, and if you get caught by one, you will be thrown out of the platform. Each guard's line of sight is 2-4 squares in front of them, including the square they stand on. [[Run trick|Corner tricking]] the guards are highly advised as it can save time. You may want to memorise the patrol patterns of the guards so you do not accidentally bump into one.\n\nBegin by following the main path, skipping the first ladder to the north. Continue until there is a ladder at a dead end. Go up the ladder (note that there is another ladder to go up to the {{FloorNumber|uk=2}}; ignore it for now), and continue south until you reach another ladder. Climb down this ladder and follow the path to find a [[crate (Monkey Madness II, satchel)|crate]] filled with satchels. Make sure to collect six satchels before going back up the ladder you just climbed down, around the corner, and back down to the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}.\n\nReturn to the first ladder you encountered, climb up, and follow the path around until you reach another ladder. Climb down this ladder and follow the path north, and you will eventually reach a [[barrel (Monkey Madness II, explosive)|barrel]] with the explosives. Fill up '''all''' of your satchels before making your way to each of the locations where charges must be placed.[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_airship_platform.png|thumb|220x220px|A player stealthily navigating through the airship platform.]]\n\n:{{Colour|Red|'''Warning:'''}} If you are caught by the guards, the explosives will be soaked and become useless, forcing you to get more explosives again. However, you will keep the empty satchels and any charges you've already planted will stay on the rig, even if you log out. '''When you finish planting all the charges, DO NOT teleport out; leave via the same ladder you came in.''' Leaving at any point in this way will not reset the explosives.\n\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - corner_tricking.gif|thumb|216x216px|Corner tricking a guard]]\nCharges must be placed on two [[compromised support|pillars]] on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}, two [[compromised floorboards|floorboards]] on the middle floor, and two [[gas cylinder]]s on the top floor. One of the floorboards is immediately south of the ladder when you climb back up. One of the pillars is back towards the start. Planting a satchel on a pillar along the way, go back to the dead end ladder on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} and climb up. Up again is to the two gas canisters (in each direction), while the last floorboard is to the west across a [[Vine (Monkey Madness II, airship)|vine swing]] and to the north. Once you plant the last explosive, your character should acknowledge this. Leave the platform via the ladder by which you arrived (to speed up this part, you can let a guard find and throw you out of the platform).\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_talking_to_Glough.png|left|thumb|220x220px|The player sat atop a mutated gorilla, discussing plans with Glough.]]\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Glough's_device.png|thumb|220x220px|Glough's device, using charged onyx gems to infuse power for his mutagens.]]\n\n====Back to Kruk's dungeon====\n\nReport back to Garkor and then head to [[Kruk's Dungeon]] where you defeated [[Kruk]] in the maze. You can skip traversing the maze by heading north and using the monkey bars with Kruk's greegree equipped. With Kruk's greegree still equipped, enter the passage to the north (don't head back to Kruk's room or go up the vine). Walk through the big doors straight ahead, climb onto the [[stunted demonic gorilla]], and climb down the stairs where three [[tortured gorilla]]s roam. If you did not bring a [[hammer]] and [[chisel]], you can search the crates downstairs until you find one of each. \n\n[[Glough]] will be in a cage, and orders you to send the three tormented gorillas back into their cage. Riding on your stunted demonic gorilla, attack all three tormented gorillas one at a time. Use [[Protect from Melee]] to negate the damage they deal to you. When they reach low health, the gorillas will go back into the cage.\n\nGlough will now speak to you, claiming the last strain of mutagen was too unstable. You ask how large is this army of creatures he has prepared, and he tells you that he is currently only using the test subjects, but once he perfects the mutagen into an airborne form, he'll be able to unleash it across Ape Atoll. He then pulls a lever, activating a [[Device (Monkey Madness II)|device]] that uses charged onyx gems to infuse power for his mutagens. He will then teleport out to find Le Smith.\n\nNow that he's gone, go onto the nearby holding area to dismount from the demonic gorilla. Climb back up the stairs, unequip the greegree, and take the [[charged onyx]] out of the device at the north end of the room. Use the chisel and hammer to invert the flow of energy, creating a [[deconstructed onyx]]. Place it back in the device; then, investigate any one of the incubation chambers to confirm that energy has been drained from the incubator, successfully corrupting it.\n\nReport back to Garkor; you can exit the caves quickly by using the vine just outside the dungeon doors. He will tell you to report to [[Awowogei]] that the trolls and ogres have backed out of the alliance, and that the secret weapon has had some complications and is too unstable to use on the battlefield. Frustrated, he cancels the assault on the mainland and strips Kruk of his rank and duties. Return to Garkor and inform him Awowogei has called off the attack. Suddenly, the screen will shake and a cutscene will play, showing Glough has proceeded with his attack plans anyway on his airship.\n\n==Chapter IV==\n{{Needed|[[Weapon]] and [[armour]] in two [[combat styles]] to defeat [[tortured gorilla|tortured]] and [[demonic gorilla]]s.|recommended=[[Food]], [[prayer potion]]s, and an emergency teleport.}}\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_airship_above_stronghold.png|thumb|250x250px|Glough's airship hovering directly above the Gnome Stronghold.]]\nReport to [[King Narnode Shareen]] that the [[Gnome Stronghold]] will be attacked by the airship. He will recommend that you recruit [[Nieve]], the highest-skilled warrior they have. Nieve can be found by the entrance to the [[Stronghold Slayer Cave]]. Ask for her help in defending the Stronghold, and she will agree, having her cousin [[Steve]] take her place.\n\n\nBy simply walking around the Stronghold with Nieve, tortured gorillas will appear. (Re-logging and standing in the west/south-west area to the entrance to the grand tree seems to encourage their spawns) They will only use melee attacks, so they can be [[safespotted]] using various trees and scenery in the Stronghold. Kill them until Nieve recommends you return to the King, restocking at the bank if necessary. If Nieve disappears at any time, she will be outside the Grand Tree. If you cannot find her there, logging out and then logging back in will return her. You can also hit the \"[[Call follower]]\" button in the bottom of the [[Worn Equipment]] interface.\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Glough's_crashed_airship.png|left|thumb|220x220px|The remains of Glough's airship after it crash lands just north of the stronghold.]]\nGo back and talk to the King. He will have the 10th Squad take care of the rest while you and Nieve head to the crash site and confront [[Glough]] should he still be alive. Head north-west of the [[Grand Tree]], and talk to [[Garkor]]. He is located by the [[Swamp toad (item)|swamp toad]] and [[king worm]] swamp and the [[tortoise]] enclosure. Go through the crash site and enter the [[Crash Site Cavern]]. There are four more tortured gorillas outside which can attack with [[Magic]] and [[Ranged]]. It is not necessary to kill them, so [[Protect from Magic]] or [[Protect from Missiles|Ranged]] and run past them.\n\nPrepare to fight two [[Tortured gorilla|tortured]] and two [[demonic gorilla]]s. After walking through the cavern you will see Glough has survived the crash, and has brought his best experiments with him.\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Fighting_Glough's_gorillas.png|thumb|250x250px|The player and Nieve fight side by side against Glough's experiments.]]\nAfter the cutscene ends, the two tortured gorillas will move in and attack; these are stronger than the ones you fought outside and can use multiple [[combat styles]]. When you kill one of the tortured gorillas, a demonic gorilla will jump down into the fight. The demonic gorillas are far stronger, boasting more health and damage. Most notable is their ability to use [[protection prayer]]s, which they will change after taking a certain amount of damage in that combat style. Their prayers completely block damage in that style, so you '''must''' bring two forms of [[combat]] to kill them normally.\n\nThe demonic gorillas have all three attack styles. Their white 'throwing' attack is [[Ranged]], green is [[Magic]], and a swipe with their claws is [[Melee]]. They will change combat styles after missing three hits in that attack style. Protect accordingly! They will also beat their chest, causing a boulder to fall on your position from the ceiling; this should be avoided by moving away. A good strategy is to kill the first demonic gorilla that jumps down before killing the second tortured gorilla, so that you don't have to fight two demonic gorillas at once. Try to keep up the correct prayers and focus down one demonic gorilla as quickly as possible, as the fight gets much easier when there is only one left.\n\nIt is also possible to let Nieve kill all four gorillas for you. Wait for her to start attacking one of the gorillas; then, run out of the room and hide behind the pile of rocks. For the demonic gorillas, ensure that they are not using Protect from Melee; if they are, keep attacking them with magic or ranged until they change prayers so Nieve can hit them. In order to do so you must attack the gorilla within the original room and then leave to the safespot, repeating the process for each gorilla. \n\nIf you die or leave the caverns before killing all four gorillas, you will have to '''start over''' and kill all four gorillas from the beginning. Nieve will be waiting outside the [[Grand Tree]] upon your return to the Stronghold. Your gravestone will appear outside of the instanced area next to Garkor.\n\n'''Note:''' Nieve will '''not''' attack the gorillas if you use \"[[Call follower]]\"; additionally, it may take Nieve some time to [[aggressiveness|aggress]] the gorillas if you end the cutscene early. Additionally, she will '''not''' attack gorillas if they are not in the room they jumped down into. She will however follow and continue to attack gorillas outside of the room if she is already in combat with them.\n\nIf you are on a [[black demon]] Slayer task, the demonic gorillas count as on task kills, and a [[Slayer helmet]] may be used.\n\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - Nieve fight safespot.png|thumb|An easy place you can hide whilst allowing Nieve to defeat the gorillas for you]]\n'''For Struggling Players:''' If you are having difficulty killing all the gorillas, simply kill both the tortured gorillas that appear; then, leave the room and hide in such a way that the demonic gorillas get stuck behind the wall. '''You MUST tank a few hits from a gorilla in order for Nieve to attack as she will only attack the last monster you were in combat with.''' For example, after you've killed one or both of the tortured gorillas, [[tank]] a few hits from Demonic Gorilla 1 so that Nieve knows which one to attack; then, hide and let her finish off that specific gorilla. Repeat these exact steps for the second demonic gorilla. If they are praying Protect from Melee, use ranged or magical attacks until they switch to [[Protect from Missiles]] or [[Protect from Magic|Magic]], and then hide again.\n\n==Chapter V==\n{{Needed|[[Weapon]] and [[armour]] to fight [[Glough]], [[food]] and [[prayer potion]]s.\n|recommended=An emergency teleport.}}\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Nieve_dies.png|thumb|220x220px|Nieve is killed by a collapsing boulder after Glough's transformation.]]\nAfter defeating the [[demonic gorillas]] Glough will drink his own mutagen, transforming himself into an abomination and then retreating. [[Nieve]] will attempt to stop him, but gets knocked back to the wall, causing a boulder to fall and crush her, killing her instantly. She will drop her [[Elysian spirit shield (Monkey Madness II)|Elysian spirit shield]], but players will find it is not much use to them. Players will now have to defeat [[Glough]]; '''it is recommended to return to a bank and restock on supplies, as the fight will prove to be challenging even to the most experienced player.'''\n\nThe player will need to fight Glough in three separate chambers, which he goes to when his health falls.\n\n'''Note:''' If the player leaves the chamber through [[teleportation]], [[death]] or through the exit at any point during the fight with Glough, all progress is reset back to the first phase. For this reason, it is suggested to '''read this entire section before proceeding'''.\n\n===Phase 1===\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Glough_phase_1_safespot.png|thumb|220x220px|A safespot available to use in the first phase.]]\nIn the first room, [[Glough]] attacks using [[Melee]] and can be attacked safely from the hallway using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. Once Glough falls to 75% health, he goes into the second room.\n\n===Phase 2===\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Glough_phase_2_safespot.png|thumb|220x220px|\nThe safespot for Glough's second phase. The player here is standing in the centre of the room where they fight Glough in Phase 1.]]\nIn the second room, Glough uses ranged attacks as well as melee, stomping the ground and dealing up to 30+ damage. It is possible, but difficult, to [[safespot]] him by using a weapon that has an [[attack range]] of 10 squares (in order of preference as they may be available: [[twisted bow]], [[bow of faerdhinen]], [[dark bow]], [[hunters' sunlight crossbow]], [[crystal bow]], [[magic comp bow]], or [[magic longbow]]. Notably, the magic comp bow still has an attack range of 10 squares on 'Rapid' and can double-hit Glough on his third phase if you are attempting to safespot him).\n\nTo do this, you will have to lure him to one square east of the first black rock on the southern wall and when you have done that, then stand exactly one square out of his attack range, which is about halfway through the room where he went for the first phase. It is suggested to activate '''[[Protect from Missiles]]''' as this reduces his damage a bit; but he can still hit up to 21 damage with each attack. Lure Glough out of the second room and back into the first, hugging the northern parts of the wall. When you lure Glough far enough, he will not do anything, allowing you to easily hit him. Once he falls to 50% health, he will walk into the final room.\n\n===Phase 3 Strategy #1===\n[[File:Battle_with_Glough.png|thumb|250x250px|Glough drags the player towards him during the final phase of the fight.]]\nIn the third and final room, [[Glough]] will now be able to attack the player using both melee and magic attacks. Glough's melee attack can send you flying backwards and dealing up to '''66 damage''' as a result. For this reason, it is recommended that players keep their health at 80+ to avoid dying as a result of this attack. '''[[Protect from Melee]]''' is highly suggested if using melee equipment to attack him. Glough will only teleport you after he is damaged, or if the player is not directly adjacent to him. [[Rings of recoil]] are suggested, especially if attempting to partially [[safespot]] him as detailed below. Therefore, it is recommended to keep [[Auto-Retaliate]] disabled and only attack Glough when the player is not in danger of dying as you are unable to eat during, and shortly after being teleported.\n\nGlough's magic attack drags the player within distance of his melee attack and deals a large amount of damage. However, it may be exploited to only allow for damage from his magic attack. To do this, use a strong [[ranged weapon]] such as the [[toxic blowpipe]], stand one square west of Glough, and attack. Whenever he teleports you to him using his magic attack, quickly return to the square just west of him and continue attacking him. '''[[Protect from Magic]]''' is highly recommended if using ranged or magic to kill Glough, as his teleport deals very high magic-based damage. His damage seems to be roughly halved using the correct [[prayer]]. If using this strategy, it is advisable to bring combo foods (e.g. a 'main' food, [[shark]]s or [[tuna potato]]es, with [[pineapple pizza]]s and/or [[Saradomin brew|brews]]/[[Super restore|restore]]s and/or [[karambwans]]) more one-click foods (e.g. tuna potatoes) over a brew/restore method, as the tick for you to move one square away and use your potions is not enough to counteract his damage. It is also possible, albeit difficult, to eat a karambwan, a high healing food and a potion all in one tick.\n\nAnother technique to use is when Glough teleports you to him, '''Protect from Melee''' and use melee attacks. When Glough pushes you away, '''Protect from Magic''' and use ranged attacks. The toxic blowpipe and [[whip]] are great weapon choices. Also a [[Dragon halberd|dragon]] or [[crystal halberd]] works wonderfully to chunk Glough's health.\n\n===Phase 3 Strategy #2===\n''It is possible, but requires skill, timing and a good connection to kill him in his third phase without taking any damage at all with a [[Attack range|10 square-range weapon]].''\n\nIt is possible to partially [[safespot]] [[Glough]] on his final form, preferably with a [[dark bow]] because of its double attack. Interestingly, the [[bow of faerdhinen]], [[crystal bow]], [[magic comp bow]] and [[Magic longbow|magic long bow]] will also shoot twice if using this method (#1 below); the second time immediately after being teleported, even while spam clicking away from Glough. Safespotting him, especially with method #2, requires great timing and experience with RuneScape's .6 tick system. Glough has an [[attack range]] of 11 squares and an aggression range seemingly between 14-18 squares (it is difficult to tell). There are two ways to go about doing this. Either way, set up [[quick prayers]] for [[Protect from Magic]] and [[Eagle Eye]] or [[Rigour]]. Stamina potions will help with this phase as using this strategy will drain run energy quickly.\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Glough_phase_3_method.gif|thumb|350x350px|A player demonstrates the safespot technique for Glough's third phase, attacking once to be dragged in, and another attack before running back quickly.]]\n\n#Turn on quick prayers and then attack him. He will teleport you to him. If you want or need to conserve [[Prayer]], switch it off mid-'flight.' After (or during, it doesn't make a difference) being teleported, '''very quickly''' (spam click on the minimap) run back at least 11 squares (1 square north of the small black boulder).\n#Similar to [[flinching]], you can continuously run between the previous chamber and the hallway to cancel Glough's aggression. You will have to '''RUN''' from the square just north of the rocks, as shown on the animation. The first few times you do this before 'getting the hang of it,' you should use the quick prayer set up just in case he teleports you, or he could hit upwards of 60 damage. He can be killed very slowly but relatively safely using this method.\n#Running or walking back has little impact on this method. Using a [[blowpipe]], you can land two hits on Glough and eat before he draws you back in with his magic attack. This allows you to do a constant barrage of attacks without having to worry about your health. Although it is recommended to use a blowpipe, a [[crossbow (weapon)|crossbow]] will work as well, only you will be able to: A) land one hit with a healing method, or B) land two hits without a healing method. If you are already at your maximum [[Hitpoints]], you can revert to more damage dealing methods such as a dark bow in place of eating as well.\n\n=== Phase 3 Strategy #3 ===\n''Similar to Phase 3 Strategy #2, it is much easier to complete however takes much longer to kill [[Glough]]. It is recommended to use this strategy if you are running very low on supplies, health, or prayer, and do not wish to restart at the beginning of the fight.''\n\nIf you struggle to kill [[Glough]] in his final phase, you can utilise a slower version of the Phase 3 Strategy #2 with the benefit of potentially not taking any damage if done correctly. This is also done in a similar manner to safespotting [[Kruk]] earlier. By staying out of range of all attacks and only attacking [[Glough]] when his health bar disappears, long range attacks can be made followed by an immediate retreat, repeating each time his health bar disappears. At this time, you can [[Quick prayers|quick pray]] with [[Protect from Magic]] and either [[Eagle Eye]] or [[Rigour]] in the event that you make a mistake. If done correctly, [[Glough]] will not attack with any of his attack styles. Since this method relies on precise action and delivering one attack at a time, using the accurate attack style is recommended.\n[[File:Monkey madness II no damage strat.gif|thumb|width=352x352|A player demonstrates a slower but safer safespot technique which waits for the health bar to disappear before re-engaging.]]\nAn example:\n\n# Utilise a long range weapon, such as the [[Magic longbow]] with its [[Special attacks|special attack]] that guarantees a hit at the cost of 35% of your special attack energy, saving time in this strategy if you notice your attacks are rarely hitting as a lower level player. A [[Lightbearer]] ring can speed the process of regaining special attack energy up if you have access to one, making this strategy twice as fast.\n# Stand one tile in front of the rock archway (one tile before the lighter coloured rocks in the east wall). Activate your quick prayer as discussed prior and attack Glough and watch as you run towards him. The exact tick your long range weapon attacks and launches its projectile (or as soon as possible for the best chance of Glough to not attack) click to run back to your starting tile. This minimises the time spent in the area '''Note:''' Stand an even amount of tiles away from where you fire the bow, else you will walk 1 tile too far and get hit.\n# Once at a safe distance, you can disable your prayers and pause to recharge special attack energy and/or run energy as required.\n# Wait until Glough's health bar has disappeared.

You will automatically be teleported outside the cavern in the nick of time by [[Zooknock]], who decided to pull you out after detecting a very powerful presence within the cavern, but couldn't get a lock on [[Nieve]]. You will explain that Glough has been defeated and that Nieve perished in the battle. You will then be instructed to report back to [[King Narnode]], and he will offer to teleport you directly to the King.\n\nReport to King Narnode, telling him that Glough has been defeated and that his demonic creations have been trapped deep within the caverns. He will then tell the player that he received a message that [[Awowogei]] himself wishes to visit the Stronghold and set up a peace treaty between [[Ape Atoll]] and the mainland. He decides to accept this offer, and a cutscene will ensue where Awowogei will negotiate a peace treaty with King Narnode Shareen with you as witness to this moment of historic importance, opening up the gates to [[Marim]] to the mainland for all.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Monkey Madness II|image=[[File:Monkey Madness II reward scroll.png|center]]|qp=4|rewards=*{{SCP|Slayer|80,000}} [[Slayer]] experience\n*{{SCP|Agility|60,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*{{SCP|Thieving|50,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{SCP|Hunter|50,000}} [[Hunter]] experience\n*2x 50,000 [[experience]] rewards from [[Duke_(monkey)|Duke]] in your choice of [[Magic]], [[Ranged]], [[Attack]], [[Defence]], [[Strength]] or [[Hitpoints]].

[[Mountain Daughter]] plays Asleif's singing, [[Sins of the Father]] plays a melancholic tune, while [[Regicide]] and [[Recruitment Drive]] play nothing.\n*During the [[cutscene]] in which the player (disguised as [[Kruk]]) meets Glough, he teleports out of the cage using the incantation \"''Umesc pro ta lauf!''\", which is translated as \"''Soul to the eye!''\", suggesting the spell teleports the caster to where their eyes are focused upon.\n**When he leaves to search for [[Assistant Le Smith]], he uses the incantation \"''Umesc pro ta andra!''\", which is translated as \"''Soul to the city!''\", suggesting the spell teleported him to [[Marim]], where Le Smith is found.\n*When telling [[Juna]] a story about the quest, the player says \"... so I defeated Glough in his mutant form and prevented a war. King Narnode Shareen & King Awowogei signed a peace treaty.\" to which she responds \"Glough's evil plans always threaten to upset the balance of our world. I am pleased you were able to stop him.\"\n*After the quest, most monkey NPCs on Ape Atoll will still speak to the player as if they were an ordinary monkey. Exceptions include [[Duke_(monkey)|Duke]], the [[Monkey child]] (as he is normally spoken to in human form), the [[Monkey archer]] when entering or exiting the gate of [[Marim]] (he will say \"an ''ally'' wishes to pass\"), and [[Awowogei]].\n*A [[Update:Monkey Madness II: Log In Competition|log in screen competition]] was held the week before release to use a player-made log in screen for the [[Main Menu]] in order to commemorate the first quest to be released on ''Old School RuneScape''. The winner of the competition, ''Golden Pleb'', was given a 3D printed model of a [[demonic gorilla]] and a t-shirt signed by the ''Old School RuneScape'' team.\n*When you inform Awowogei that the trolls and ogres have backed out of the alliance, that the airships have been destroyed, and that the secret weapon is unstable, Awowogei says \"You've failed me for the last time, Kruk.\" This is likely a reference to Darth Vader's line, \"You have failed me for the last time, Admiral,\" in The Empire Strikes Back.\n*If you finish Keef with a multi-hit attack (e.g. the [[dragon dagger]] or [[dragon halberd]] specials), he will forfeit once for each finishing hit, with the same dialogue each time.\n*When confronting Glough in the Crash Site Cavern and Nieve says \"I swear by my shiny blue shield that I will end you right here.\", it may be a reference to the line from the TV show Firefly \"I swear by my pretty floral bonnet that I will end you.\"\n*When spotted by the guard monkeys on the airship platform, they will display \"!\" above their heads. This is a reference to the reaction enemies have when one is spotted while sneaking around in the [[wikipedia:Metal_Gear|Metal Gear Solid]] series.\n*In the lower level of Kruk's dungeon, the word \"Maniacal\" can partially be seen spelled out in the north-west corner of the map by zooming the camera out. Using an [[Oculus orb]], the full text can be seen.\n*During the airship platform stealth portion of the quest, examining a piece of an iron barred gate laying against a crate gives the message \"''They're trying to build a prison for you and me to live in.''\" This is a reference to the chorus of the 2001 track ''Prison Song'' by System of a Down.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nMonkey Madness II artwork.png|A piece of artwork of the quest.\nMonkey Madness II login screen.png|The log in screen upon the release of the quest.\nMonkey Madness II log in screen competition prize - 3D printed demonic gorilla.jpg|The 3D printed demonic gorilla given to the log in screen competition winner.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Monkey Madness II}}"

To get to that area, you can use the [[enchanted lyre]] and head east; walk north from [[Seers' Village]] or use the [[Fairy rings|fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|ajr}} and then go north a bit; or if your house is in Rellekka, teleport to your [[Player-owned house|house]] and go east, or by using Fremennik sea boots head east.\n\n[[File:Mountain Daughter - Entering the mountain camp.png|thumb|left|A player using a rope to climb down the cliffside.]]\nStart up the path to the [[Mountain Camp]], and attempt to climb over the rockslide. The guard says you are not welcome and does not allow you to pass. Just a bit to the left is another, narrow path. Follow it, and use your [[rope]] on the boulder that says \"push boulder\" and you will automatically climb down.\n\nNote: you can skip trying to climb the initial rockslide and go directly to the boulder on the second path.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Hamal's daughter===\n[[File:Hamal the Chieftain chathead.png|left]]\nFollow the path into the village, enter the longhouse to the east, and speak to [[Hamal the Chieftain]] by asking, ''\"Why is everyone so hostile?\"'', to begin the quest. Speaking of his tribe, Hamal tells you that they are citizens of [[Rellekka]], although due to differences they have moved out to become closer to nature, disagreeing with the [[Fremennik]] tradition of choosing their tools over skill. The chieftain tells you about his missing daughter and after much arguing against \"employing\" an outerlander, he eventually allows you to search for her. From this point on, you can enter the camp by climbing over the rockslide.\n\nHead south of Hamal's house, and take some [[mud]] from the roots along the edge of the bubbling mud pond.\n\nIf you did not bring a staff, go north of Hamal's house to [[Jokul]]'s place and pick up the [[pole]].\n\n===Crisis ===\n[[File:Mountain Daughter - Climbing the tree.png|thumb|Climbing the tall tree to gain access to the island.]]\nJust north of Hamal's tent are [[mountain goat]]s. Follow the path leading west along the [[Shining pool]]. Follow it until you reach a tall tree by the geysers above the path you came up.\n\n#Use the [[mud]] you gathered on the tall tree to prevent yourself from slipping.\n# Climb the tall tree, crawl along its branch, and jump down to the little island.\n#Use your [[pole]] or [[staff]] on the clump of rocks to pole-vault over them.\n# Then use the [[plank]] to cross the flat stone.\n#On one of the [[Shining pool (scenery)|bubbles]] rising from the pool, select \"Listen-to Shining pool\".\n\n: '''Note:''' The [[Dramen staff]] can no longer be used as a pole vault as it was changed from a staff to a blunt weapon.<ref>Update: [[Update:QoL and Treasure Trails Feedback Changes|QoL and Treasure Trails Feedback Changes]] - April 18 2019</ref>\n\nYou hear the voice of the spirit of the chieftain's daughter [[Asleif Hamalsdotter]], who is dead. She asks you to make peace between her tribe and [[Rellekka]] and to also find a new food source for the camp. Agree to help her. To return to shore, use a plank on the flat stone. You can do her two tasks in either order.\n:'''Note:''' Both tasks can be started at the same time. This reduces going back to the [[Mountain Camp]] multiple times.

Ask about the people of [[Rellekka]], and he tells you that he sent a villager named [[Svidi]] to initiate a simple trade route, but he hasn't yet returned. Head to the rockslide that first blocked your entrance to the Mountain Camp. Climb over it, and go into the forest north-west of the rockslide, outside the entrance to Keldagrim. Locate and speak with Svidi. To find Svidi, go to the black unicorns and look for a fast moving yellow dot on your mini map between the fence shortcut and the south fence turn. you must run to catch him once spotted.\n:'''Note:''' Make sure to choose the option \"Can't I persuade you to go in there somehow?\", as the other option will cause him to walk off and you will have to find him again.\n\nHe will tell you he's afraid of the [[Fremennik]] in Rellekka and thinks that they might kill him. Offer to help him enter Rellekka and he agrees if you can secure a promise from the chieftain that he will be safe.\n\nHead to Rellekka, and talk to [[Brundt the Chieftain]] in the longhall. He will give you a [[safety guarantee]], promising not to hurt Svidi if you can retrieve a relic - an ancient rock - that the Mountain Camp tribe stole from Rellekka long ago.\n\n[[File:Mountain Daughter - Mining the ancient rock.png|thumb|A player mining the Ancient Rock.]]\nReturn to the Mountain Camp, and enter the large tent south-west of Hamal the Chieftain. If you want, you can first talk to Hamal, but he refuses to let you have the rock. ''Right-click'' to use your [[pickaxe]] on the Ancient rock located in the southern tent to acquire [[half a rock]]. If you're wielding your [[pickaxe]], you will have to ''right-click on the'' ancient rock, as it cannot be mined using ''left-click''. Take this back to Rellekka, and talk to Brundt the Chieftain, who will agree to share the rock and give you the guarantee of safe passage. Take the guarantee to Svidi to initiate peace talks between the two tribes.\n\n'''Note:''' Once back in Rellekka with your pickaxe, now may be a good time to run north to the mine and gather some coal for the [[Fremennik Diary]] task.  Players will need to have completed [[The Fremennik Trials]] to enter the mine.\n\n===Finding food===\n{{Needed|A pair of [[gloves]]|recommended=A [[ring of dueling]] or a [[Camelot Teleport]]}}\n\nReturn again to the [[Mountain Camp]] and speak with [[Hamal the Chieftain|Hamal]], and then talk to [[Jokul]], who is in the tent north of Hamal, looking after his [[mountain goat]]s. He will tell you that he thinks the members of the Mountain Camp could survive if the seed of a [[White pearl]] fruit, a hardy plant which can grow anywhere, were planted in the area.\n\n:'''''Note:''' You must have talked to Jokul before being able to pick the fruit.''\n\n[[File:Mountain Daughter - The thornbush.png|thumb|left|A thorny bush, just south of the [[gnome glider]] on the peak of [[White Wolf Mountain]].]]\nTravel to the peak of [[White Wolf Mountain]] and look for [[thorny bushes]] near the [[gnome glider]]. If you have completed [[The Grand Tree]] [[quest]], you may use a [[ring of dueling]] to teleport to the [[Emir's Arena]] which is near a gnome glider. Head west from the Emir's Arena to the glider, then fly to the mountains. Alternatively, you may use a Camelot Teleport and walk up the mountain. Put on your [[gloves]] (4 damage will be inflicted if not wearing any, and you won't get the fruit seed), pick a [[White pearl]] fruit off the thorny bushes and eat it. You will automatically spit out the [[White pearl seed]].\n\nGo back to the Mountain Camp and give the White pearl seed to Hamal the Chieftain, who accepts your solution for feeding the tribe.\n\n===The Kendal===\n{{Needed|An axe, combat equipment, a staff (or pole found by Jokul), and a plank}}\n\nAfter you've completed both tasks, go back to the shining pool and speak to [[Asleif Hamalsdotter|Asleif]] again (make sure to pole vault, and use your [[plank]] on the flat stone). She asks you to convince her father that she is really dead. She was attacked by a creature ([[the Kendal]]) and dragged off nearby to the north where she was killed. Leave the island and head to the north side of the pool (alternatively, cross the gap without using the plank; you'll end up on the north side). Follow the path east to a cave blocked by dead trees. Chop down the ones that block your path with an [[axe]] until you reach a cave entrance (if you face problems chopping down the trees, stand to the west side of the first tree when chopping it down to walk over the stump).\n\nEnter the cave and make your way to the large cavern. You find the Kendal as well as numerous corpses near a central pillar. Talk to the Kendal, and when it asks who you are, say, \"It's just me, no one special\", and then \"You mean a sacrifice?\". The Kendal tells you that it is the god of the northern lands.\n\nSay that he actually looks like a man in a bearsuit, to which he finally admits. After you blow his cover, he also confesses to killing Asleif more than ten years ago. Humbly request her remains, to which he refuses as he cannot let anyone know his true identity. Threaten to kill him, and he'll attack you. He has 50 [[hitpoints]] and a [[combat level]] of 70, and all damage can be blocked if you use the [[Protect from Melee]] [[Prayer]]. If you are using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]], you can find a [[safespot]] around the skeletons to attack him.\n\n: '''Note:''' It is possible to defeat the Kendal with a Dwarf Multicannon. If safespotting, be careful though: after attacking the boss, another one will spawn. The cannon will hit him too, making him aggressive, and repeating the process multiple times.\n\nOnce he dies, a [[Bearhead]] mask will appear in your [[inventory]]. Take Asleif's corpse, which lies in the south-eastern corner of the pillars ([[corpse of woman]]), and exit the cave. Cut your way back out of the dead trees and head back to [[Hamal the Chieftain]]. Tell him what you learned and show him his daughter's corpse.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nFile:Mountain Daughter - Entering the Kendal's cave.png|The Kendal's cave.\nFile:Kendal safespot.png|The safespot for the Kendal.\n</gallery>\n\n===Finishing up===\n{{Needed|5 muddy rocks, a staff (or pole found by Jokul), and a plank}}\n\nHamal asks you to give her a proper burial by building a grave on the island at the centre of the pool topped with a cairn, symbolising the longboats used to cross the seas, and some of her possessions. He tells you perhaps [[Ragnar]] has one of her possessions for you to use. On your way up, gather five [[muddy rock]]s from the mountain goat pen. The rocks [[Spawning|respawn]] quickly, so it's possible just to pick up the same rock multiple times. \n\n[[File:Mountain Daughter - Creating the burial.png|thumb|A player creating the burial cairn for Asleif.]]\nFollow the path up to Ragnar (he is just past the tall tree), and speak with him. He gives you [[Asleif's necklace]], which he had intended to give her as a gift. Climb up the tall tree, pole-vault the clump of rocks, and use the plank on the flat stones to make your way back to the small island. Bury the corpse there; you will  go to the designated burial location. Use the muddy rocks on the burial mound to create Asleif's [[burial cairn]].\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Mountain Daughter\n|image = [[File:Mountain Daughter reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Prayer|2,000}} [[Prayer]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Attack|1,000}} [[Attack]] experience\n*The [[Bearhead]]\n*The ability to pass into the [[Mountain Camp]] over the rockslide\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[The Kendal]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Mountain Daughter is required for the following:\n* [[The Fremennik Exiles]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{{MusicUnlockTableHead}}\n{{MusicUnlockLine|Settlement|details=Unlocked upon approaching the Mountain Camp.}}\n{{MusicUnlockLine|Cave of Beasts|details=Unlocked in the Kendal's cave north of the Mountain Camp.}}\n{{MusicUnlockTableBottom}}\n\n==Trivia==\n{{Listen\n|title = Congratulations, quest complete!\n|align = right\n|filename = Mountain Daughter quest complete.ogg\n|desc = The song that plays upon completion of the quest.\n}}\n*When you complete the quest, instead of hearing the normal quest complete music, the game plays Asleif's singing and you receive a message saying \"You think you can hear a soft 'thank you' as the singing quietens down.\"\n** Additionally, when Asleif asks you to make peace between her tribe and Rellekka, you can ask if this involves [[Good anthem|an anthem]].

Refer to the map on the [[Roving Elves]] quest page for these locations. You may travel to any of them and then switch worlds to find her.\n\nShe will lead you to the rebel elven outpost [[Lletya]]. Talk to [[Arianwyn]], the leader of the elves in this outpost. He will reveal to you that the [[mourner]]s in [[West Ardougne]] are really [[Iorwerth]] elves from [[Prifddinas]], and that it is your job to uncover their evil plot. He will tell that these mourners frequently cross the overpass of [[Arandar]] between the elven capital and West Ardougne, allowing you to easily ambush one there. Arianwyn then gives you a [[teleport crystal]] that allows you to teleport back to Lletya.\n\nThis crystal contains charges, with one being consumed per teleportation. It starts with four charges. If the crystal is used efficiently, this will be enough teleports for both this quest and [[Mourning's End Part II|Part II]]. [[Eluned]] is able to grant it three charges whenever it becomes uncharged, or five charges if the [[Hard Western Provinces Diary]] is completed. She charges a maximum of 750 coins for this service, although you would have to find her again first.\n\n===Obtaining mourner gear===\n[[File:Arandar.png|thumb|right|The northern entrance to the [[Arandar]] pass.]]\n{{Needed|[[Bucket of water]], 2 [[silk]], [[bear fur]] and 7 empty inventory spaces.|recommended=[[Weapon]], [[food]] (if low combat stats), [[necklace of passage]], [[ring of dueling]], Fast travel to [[Taverley]] ([[House teleport]], [[Balloon network]], [[Falador teleport]]), and a [[teleport crystal]]}}\n\nHead towards the entrance of [[Arandar]]. The fastest way is by travelling with the [[necklace of passage]] to the [[Outpost]], then walking westwards. There, kill a level-11 [[mourner]] to obtain their outfit. Right before you land your first hit, they will always attempt to throw a potion that reduces your combat stats to 20, including your [[Hitpoints]]. Stats reduced this way cannot be instantly restored with a potion. However, they may be restored with the [[pool of refreshment]] in the [[Ferox Enclave]] or the [[Fancy rejuvenation pool|fancy]] or [[ornate rejuvenation pool]] in the [[player-owned house]]. It is possible to kill the mourner without having your stats reduced, if you initiate combat with a weapon that can either 1-hit kill it, or hits multiple times at once to add up enough damage to kill it. For example, a spec attack from a [[Magic shortbow]] is one possible method.\n\nYou will need everything that the mourner drops, excluding their [[bones]]:\n\n*[[Gas mask]]\n*[[Bloody mourner top]]\n*[[Ripped mourner trousers]]\n*[[Mourner boots]]\n*[[Mourner gloves]]\n*[[Mourner cloak]]\n*[[Mourner letter]]\n\nBecause the top is covered in blood, you will first have to clean it before it can be worn. Go to [[Taverley]] and talk with the druid [[Tegid]], who is doing his laundry by the lake. He will however refuse to lend you his [[Tegid's soap|soap]]. Therefore, you must steal it from his laundry basket (with level 50 [[Thieving]]). While holding a [[bucket of water]], use the soap on the bloody mourner top to [[mourner top|clean]] it. Tegid's soap is no longer required after this point, so you may drop it or deposit it in the bank as a souvenir to save an inventory spot.\n\nTravel to [[Lletya]], optimally with the [[teleport crystal]], to repair the pair of trousers. Talk to the elven seamstress [[Oronwen]], who will be able to repair the trousers if provided with a [[bear fur]] and two [[silk]]. You may also purchase the required [[dyes]] ([[red dye|red]], [[yellow dye|yellow]], [[green dye|green]], and [[blue dye|blue]]) from her if you haven't acquired them yet.\n\n===Infiltrating the headquarters===\n{{Needed|[[Mourner letter]], the full [[mourner gear]], [[feather]], [[magic logs]], [[leather]] and [[toad crunchies]] or [[premade t'd crunch]].}}\nWearing the full [[mourner gear]], you may enter the [[Mourner Headquarters]] in [[West Ardougne]], located in the north-east corner of the city. Enter the basement via the [[trapdoor (Mourner Headquarters)|trapdoor]] in the north-western corner, where you will find level-108 [[mourner]]s and their commander, [[Essyllt]]. Speak with him to show him your letter, and he welcomes you aboard.\n\nEssyllt will explain you that their job is to keep the people of Ardougne believing in the plague. One of their ways of doing it involved dyeing Farmer Brumty's sheep. However, their colour is starting to vanish and they will need to be redyed, a task he assigns you to do. Normally, they use a gnomic device to dye them unseen from a distance, however it has broken down and the [[Gnome (Mourner Headquarters)|gnome tinkerer]] refuses to tell the elves how to repair it. The elf allows you to interrogate the gnome and hands you the [[broken device]] and a [[tarnished key]] to the torture chamber.\n\nSpeak with this gnome in the adjacent room to learn about the variety of torture methods the elves already tried on him. He will accidentally spill that he is vulnerable to having his feet tickled and that he craves for some [[toad crunchies]], and then realises his mistake. Repeat what he said back to him. {{Chat option|3 You talked about toad crunchies and being tickled}}\n\nThen ''use'' a [[feather]] on the gnome to tickle him while having the toad crunchies or a [[premade t'd crunch]] in your inventory. Make sure to '''not''' give him the toad crunchies before tickling him, or you will need new ones. The gnome will beg you to stop. Get him off the rack so he may fix the broken device, if you provide him with [[magic logs]] and [[leather]]. He will then hand you a [[fixed device]]. Talk with him again to ask him about the ammunition needed, which turns out to be dyed [[swamp toad]]s that gruesomely explode when launched from the device.\n\n===Sheep===\n[[File:Fixed device aim.png|thumb|200px|The aim and fire interface.]]\n{{Needed|[[Fixed device]], [[red dye]], [[blue dye]], [[yellow dye]], [[green dye]] and an [[ogre bellows]].}}\n{{Map|align=right|mtype=pin|caption=Location of the sheep.\n|2609,3389,title:Location of the yellow sheep,icon:yellowPin,desc:\n|2620,3368,title:Location of the green sheep,icon:greenPin,desc:\n|2608,3346,title:Location of the red sheep,icon:redPin,desc:\n|2569,3383,title:Location of the blue sheep,icon:bluePin,desc:\n}}\nThese toads can be found in the [[Feldip hills]]. You may easily reach this location with a [[Feldip hills teleport]] or by travelling with [[fairy rings]] to {{Fairycode|AKS}}. Alternatively, they can be found south of Castle Wars, easily accessible with a [[ring of dueling]] or with [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|BKP}}.\n\nSimilar to how you have captured the toads during the [[Big Chompy Bird Hunting]] quest, you will require an [[ogre bellows]]. However, instead of filling it with swamp gas, you need to '''''use''''' dye on it. Using a dyed ogre bellows on a swamp toad results in an inflated toad of that colour. Inflate at least one toad in each of the four colours (for safety you can use extra dyes get multiple toads in each colour, as the toad will be used up if you miss during the next step), and then travel to the coloured sheep from the [[Sheep Herder]] [[quest]] north of [[Ardougne]].\n\nUse one of the coloured toads on the [[fixed device]], and then wield the device. When near the flock of sheep in that colour, select ''Aim and Fire'' in [[Combat Options]], and aim the crosshair at any of the sheep in the flock. Shoot by pressing the red button in the centre of the crosshair. Successfully hitting one will coat the entire flock of sheep. \n\nRepeat the process for the other three colours. When finished, return to [[Essyllt]].\n\n===Another favour===\n{{Needed|Full [[mourner gear]] and a [[barrel of naphtha]] (or at least 10 [[coal]] to make the barrel).}}\nEssyllt will tell you that someone has [[Biohazard#Infiltrating the Mourner HQ|poisoned their stew]] recently, causing them to get plague-like symptoms. He will want to apply these symptoms on some of the citizens to stimulate the rumour of the plague. You will need to reproduce the poison.\n\nTake a [[rotten apple]] north-west of the [[Mourner Headquarters]]. Rotten apples from elsewhere will not work. Go to [[Elena]], the scientist you rescued during [[Plague City]]. Her house is north-west in [[East Ardougne]]. Ask her for help, and she will reluctantly give in. Continue talking to her and hand her the apple, eventually she hands you a [[sieve]] that you will need later.\n\n[[File:Mashing apples.png|thumb|200px|Mashing the rotten apples.]]\nTravel to the [[apple orchard]], located directly west of the [[Combat Training Camp]], a short distance north-west from Elena's house. In the orchard, take a [[barrel]] and use it on a [[rotten apple pile]]. Then, use the barrel of [[rotten apples]] on the [[apple press]]. You will elegantly mash them up into an [[apple barrel]].\n\nYou will now require a [[barrel of naphtha]]. If you already have one, skip to the ''[[#Poisoning the Food|Poisoning the Food]]'' section.\n\n[[File:Regicide - Coal tar location.png|thumb|left|200px|The location to obtain the coal-tar.]]\nYou now need to add a solvent to make the poison nonlethal and undetectable. Take another barrel from the apple orchard or [[Tyras Camp]], and use it on the [[Coal Tar|coal tar swamp]] south of [[Isafdar]] to get a [[barrel of coal tar]]. Then, gather at least 10 regular [[coal]] and go to the [[Chemist]]'s house in [[Rimmington]].\n\nFollow these simple steps to obtain a barrel of naphtha:\n#Rotate the tar regulator clockwise twice to make the tar flow at its maximum. The 'pressure' indicator on the left should go up.\n#When the pressure enters the green region, rotate the pressure valve clockwise once to let out some pressure. This should stall the pressure indicator.\n#Start adding coal. This raises the 'heat' indicator on the right. If it is below the green region, add more coal. If it is above, do not add coal until it gets lower.\n#If the heat reading reaches the dark orange portion, you have spoiled your compound and must start again; although the coal is wasted, it can be redone with the same barrel of tar.\n#If you run out of coal, your progress will be saved. This means you do not have to re-set the pressure or re-add coal to it.\n\nWhen the green bar on the bottom is full, stop adding coal and close the window to replace your barrel of coal tar with a barrel of naphtha.\n\n===Poisoning the food===\n{{Needed|Full [[mourner gear]], [[barrel of naphtha]], [[apple barrel]] and the [[sieve]].|recommended=[[Teleport crystal]].}}\nUse the [[barrel of naphtha]] on the [[apple barrel]] to get a [[naphtha apple mix]]. Then, use your [[sieve]] on it to obtain a barrel of [[toxic naphtha]].  The sieve is no longer needed after this point. After first ensuring that you have two free inventory slots, cook this product on a [[range]] in order to turn it into two heaps of [[toxic powder]] (there is a range inside the [[Mourner Headquarters]]). It must be a range, '''Do not''' use a fire! Once the toxic powder is made, you no longer need the empty barrels. Place the powder on two sack of grain locations in [[West Ardougne]]. These are found just outside the West Ardougne general store and inside the office north of the [[manhole (West Ardougne)|manhole]].\n\nGo back to Essyllt once more, who will now trust you enough to disclose secret information. Their plan is to delve into the mountains, with the help of enslaved citizens of West Ardougne, under the pretext they fell victim to the plague. They will make a tunnel towards the [[Temple of Light]], to make it easier to resurrect their \"Dark Lord\".\n\nAfter talking to [[Essyllt]], head back to [[Lletya]] ([[teleport crystal]]) and talk to [[Arianwyn]] to complete the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Mourning's End Part I\n|image = [[File:Mourning's End Part I reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Thieving|40,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{SCP|Hitpoints|25,000}} [[Hitpoints]] experience\n*Access to the [[Mourner HQ]] basement and the village of [[Lletya]]\n*[[Elf teleport crystal]]\n*The [[fixed device]]\n*Full [[Mourner gear|mourner clothing]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Mourning's End Part I is required for the following:\n*[[Mourning's End Part II]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 30 November 2022\n|update = The Garden of Death & More\n|poll = Future Quests & Combat Achievement Rewards\n|change = The experience rewarded to the [[Thieving]] skill was increased from 25,000 to 40,000.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = \n|update = \n|change = The quest was renamed from \"Mourning's Ends Part I\" to \"Mourning's End Part I\".\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|daterange = 28 November -<br/>18 December 2006\n|update = \n|change = The quest was renamed from \"Mourning's Ends Part 1\" to \"Mourning's Ends Part I\".\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* If the player has completed the quest [[Eadgar's Ruse]], Tegid will comment on the fact that you stole clothes from his washing line.\n* The name \"Mourning's Glory\" was proposed for the quest during its development as a play on the {{WP|morning glory}} family of flowers, but was likely dismissed due to its use as a slang term for {{WP|nocturnal penile tumescence}}.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1202274001265016833|date=4 December 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204172502/https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1202274001265016833|archivedate=4 December 2019|quote=I think the dev who originally wrote the Mournings End(s) quests pitched \"Mourning's Glory\" as a title, but was asked not to do that, even if it were just a reference to the types of flower by that name.}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Mourning's End Part I}}"

Bring a [[teleport crystal]], and some food if you have low [[Defence]] or do not have {{SCP|Prayer|43|link=yes}} for [[Protect from Melee]]. Also, bring a [[chisel]]. Go to the basement of the [[Mourner HQ]] in West Ardougne, and talk to [[Essyllt]].\n\nHe will give you a [[new key]] to the nearby [[Mourner Tunnels|tunnels]] that they dug to the [[Temple of Light]]. He will ask you to find the digging team. Leave the head mourner's room and open the door on the west wall. Go into the tunnel. You will see level 182 [[Dark beast]]s.\n\n'''Note:''' [[Ironmen]] can receive a [[catalytic talisman]] as a reward from the [[Guardians of the Rift]] [[minigame]] or a [[death talisman]] from killing the [[Dark beast|dark beasts]] (requiring {{SCP|Slayer|90|link=yes}}), which will save a lot of time further on in the quest.\n\nRun past them to the west whilst praying Protect from Melee, to reach the temple entrance.

Alternatively, if you are lacking inventory space, you can pick up only some of the mirrors and crystals and go back and get more. You will need 4 inventory spaces for the first steps of the puzzle, increasing to 13 inventory spaces open for the last step of the puzzle. You may freely bank at any time, especially between the completion of each puzzle. If you leave in the middle of a puzzle, the puzzle will be unchanged when you return. However, you cannot bank the mirrors and crystals received in the temple, so it is not recommended.\n\nIf you're having trouble rotating mirrors while under attack, you can press 1 to rotate the mirror as soon as the dialogue comes up, if on PC—this should give you one or two rotation attempts between each attack.\n\n====Chest #1====\n[[File:Mourning's End Part II - chest 1 solution.png|275px|right|thumb|Chest #1 solution.]]\n{{Checklist|\n*Go back to the [[Temple of Light]].\n*Take the stairs just west of the entrance up to the middle floor.\n*Head to the area indicated by the rope on the guide map and use your rope on the rocks to free up 1 inventory space.

You will ask each other how you got to the altar, and he will reveal there is a passage from the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] created by him and his companions. You will ask if he knows [[Klank]], after which he will realise you are the one who had slain [[Iban]]. Because of this, he agrees to trade you a [[death talisman]] in return for some supplies.\n\nHe gives you an [[item list]] that tells you what you need to get him:\n{{Checklist|\n*[[Babydragon bones]]\n*[[Ball of wool]]\n*[[Bronze bar]]\n*[[Bronze med helm]]\n*[[Bucket of milk]]\n*[[Cake tin]]\n*[[Cheese]]\n*[[Chisel]]\n*[[Cooked meat]]\n*[[Egg]]\n*[[Facemask]]\n*[[Fishing rod]]\n*[[Flax]]\n*[[Gold ring]]\n*[[Hammer]]\n*[[Iron axe]]\n*[[Iron nails]]\n*[[Iron pickaxe]]\n*[[Jug of wine]]\n*[[Kebab]]\n*[[Knife]]\n*[[Leather boots]]\n*[[Leather gloves]]\n*[[Lobster pot]]\n*[[Lockpick]]\n*[[Necklace mould]]\n*[[Needle]]\n*[[Oak logs]]\n*[[Pie dish]]\n*[[Plank]]\n*[[Pot of flour]]\n*[[Potato cactus]]\n*[[Potatoes|Potatoes(10)]] (a sack of potatoes)\n*[[Pure Essence]]\n*[[Redberries]]\n*[[Rope]]\n*[[Rotten tomato]]\n*[[Shears]]\n*[[Skull (item)|Skull]]\n*[[Spade]]\n*[[Swamp paste]]\n*[[Thread]]\n*[[Tinderbox]]\n*[[Unicorn horn dust]]\n*[[Vial of water]]\n*[[White apron]]\n*[[White berries]]\n\n*One of these three tickets:\n**[[Archery ticket]]\n**[[Agility arena ticket]] (must be new ticket and not discontinued)\n**[[Castle wars ticket]]\n:''The needed ticket is chosen randomly.''\n*One of these three books:\n**[[Crumbling tome]] (Legend of the Brothers)\n**[[Slashed book|Slashed]]/[[battered book]] (Book of the Elemental Shield)\n**[[Prifddinas' history]] (The Creation of Prifddinas)\n:''The needed book is chosen randomly.''\n:''All of these books can be found in the bookcases in your house.''\n*One of these three keys:\n**[[Jail key]]\n**[[Dusty key]]\n**[[Door key (Witch's House)|Door key]] (For [[witch's house (location)|witch's house]])\n:''The needed key is chosen randomly.''\n}}\n\nYou will need to give these items in more than one trip. Luckily, these items are all easily obtained and most players likely have many of them stored in their bank already. If returning to the bank in East Ardougne and running back to the altar through the mourner's headquarters, you will need to keep your mourner's outfit and new key for each trip. However, you should not need any other supplies, as these trips should be quick enough not to drain your prayer points to 0, and you can pray at the altar on the way back to West Ardougne each time you refill your inventory. If you get rid of Thorgel's list to save an inventory slot, you can ask him for another.\n\n'''{{Colour|red|Warning}}: If you teleport out, make sure you turn the mirror towards the cyan door first!''' Otherwise, you'll lock yourself out and you'll have to go through the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] and enter the Temple of Light via the tunnel inside the dwarf camp. The entry at the dwarf camp is most easily reached from [[Lletya]], which is fairly close to the elven land entrance to the Underground Pass; doing the Underground Pass in reverse to get to the dwarf village is a lot easier. To do this, enter the dungeon first on the elven side, down the well then down to the dwarf camp. The tunnel is located directly south of the main building. It is not marked on the minimap, so it is rather difficult to see.\n\nOn your final trip, make sure to bring the [[newly made crystal]] and [[teleport crystal]] instead of an Ardougne teleport.\n\n===The power of death===\n[[File:Temple of Light repowered crystal.png|thumb|220px|The temple's safeguard is now restored.]]\nUse your [[catalytic talisman]] or [[death talisman]] on the [[Death Altar]] (or equip the tiara equivalents) then use the [[newly made crystal]] that [[Eluned]] repaired for you on it to charge it. (If you have {{SCP|Runecraft|65+|link=yes}}, and you brought a pure essence, make a death rune as well, to complete that step of the [[Ardougne Diary#Hard|hard Ardougne Diary]].) Exit the Death Altar, and then exit the final chamber and make your way to the black crystal that you observed at the beginning of the quest. Use this charged crystal on the black crystal. This will stop people from entering the temple for another thousand years! Go back to [[Lletya]], and talk to Arianwyn for your reward.\n\n'''Congratulations!

The culprit is random for each player, so some investigation must be done to determine the murderer. However, there are plenty of clues to be found around the [[Sinclair Mansion]].\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = The [[Sinclair Mansion]], north along the path between [[Seers' Village]] and [[Camelot]].

However, there are plenty of clues to be found as to who the culprit is.\n\n===Starting out===\n{{Map|x=2741|y=3562|r=4|mtype=square|width=250|height=250|align=right|caption=The quest's start point.}}\nHead to the [[Sinclair Mansion]] located north to [[Camelot|camelot castle]].\n\nTalk to the [[Guard (Sinclair Mansion)|guard]] to activate the quest. Then, enter the house and search the murder scene, which is on the east side of the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}. There are three things you need to do in this room.\n\n# Inside will be a [[pungent pot]] on a table, which you should pick up.\n# There is the [[criminal's dagger]] on the floor, which you should collect.\n# Investigate the smashed window to find the [[criminal's thread]].\n\nGo around to the various bedrooms belonging to the suspects to find six silver items, all contained within barrels in each room. (There are four rooms upstairs and two on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}.) Look for:\n\n*[[Anna]]'s [[silver necklace]]\n*[[Bob (Sinclair)|Bob]]'s [[silver cup]]\n*[[Carol]]'s [[silver bottle]]\n*[[David (Murder Mystery)|David]]'s [[silver book]]\n*[[Elizabeth (Murder Mystery)|Elizabeth]]'s [[silver needle]]\n*[[Frank]]'s [[silver pot (Murder Mystery)|silver pot]]\n\nNow, it's time to get your first piece of evidence. Go to the main entrance of the mansion, and go north-east until you reach the [[Sinclair Guard dog|guard dog]] enclosure. Investigate the sturdy wooden gate for more information.\n\nNext, go to the gardener's shed (the small house on the ground level, west side of the outside of the mansion) and investigate the sacks to find [[flypaper]]. Take seven of these.\n\nGo to the kitchen, and fill your pot with flour. Use it on the criminal's dagger; then, use the dagger on a piece of flypaper to get an [[unknown print]]. Dust each silver item with more flour, and use the flypaper to lift fingerprints from the items; then, compare them to the print of the criminal's dagger you found at the crime scene by using the flypaper pieces on the first flypaper print you got from the dagger.\n\n'''Note:''' You may want to keep the silver necklace since it is a unique cosmetic item and cannot be obtained after completing the quest. If so, you will need to drop the item before completing the quest and pick it up afterwards. Otherwise, the item is taken from your bank or inventory upon quest completion.\n\nOnce you've got a match, all the silver items are no longer needed and can be safely dropped, except for your proof.\n\nYou'll need more than just that for a conviction, though. Go to the entrance of the mansion, and talk to [[Gossip]], and ask him who he thinks is responsible.\n\n[[File:Murder Mystery - Poison Salesman.png|thumb|250px|Talking to the Poison Salesman]]\n\nNext, you need to gather info about the poison. There's a [[Poison Salesman|poison salesman]], who sells it inside of the pub west of the [[bank]] in [[Seers' Village]]. Ask him to whom he sold the poison, and he'll tell you that everyone at the mansion bought some.\n\nGo back to the house and ask the person who had the fingerprints on the criminal's dagger to find out what the poison was used on. Search the item they mention, detailed here:\n\n*Anna - Compost heap\n*Bob - Beehive in cow pen\n*Carol - Sinclair mansion drain, west of the front door\n*David - [[Spiders' nest]], upstairs between the two rooms with three beds each in them\n*Elizabeth - The fountain\n*Frank - Family Crest, east of the front door\n\nYou'll find that the subject was lying and didn't use their poison on what they had said they did.\n\n'''Note: '''The guard will take the evidence from you. If you dusted the silver necklace with flour, and wish to keep it, drop it before talking to the guard (banking the silver necklace prior will not work and will be removed from your bank).\n\nGo back and talk to a guard and tell him you know who did it. Use the fingerprints of the person that did it on the unknown fingerprint. Show him the fingerprints, tell him about the poison, and show him the thread from the windowsill, since its colour will be a match to an article of the culprit's clothing. Case closed!\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Murder Mystery\n|image = [[File:Murder Mystery reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 3\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Crafting|1,406}} [[Crafting]] [[experience]]\n*2,000 [[Coins]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Murder Mystery is required for the following:\n*[[Recipe for Disaster]]\n*[[King's Ransom]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n{{Murder Mystery}}"

He is found in the [[Troll kitchen]], go south after going down the stairs. He has heard from another [[adventurer]] that [[human]]s can grow [[goutweed]] and wonders if you can help. You will see a short [[cutscene]] with this adventurer in a cooking pot, with his [[dragon armour]] strewn over the floor. Burntmeat wants his assistant, [[My Arm]], to learn how to farm. \n\nMy Arm is at the back of the room; talk to him, and he will tell you he needs the [[goutweedy lump]] from the [[cooking pot (My Arm's Big Adventure)|cooking pot]] on [[Death Plateau (location)|Death Plateau]]. Either talk to Burntmeat and follow his instructions to get to the Death Plateau or travel there via other means such as the [[games necklace]].\n\nWhen near [[Death Plateau (location)|Death Plateau]], it is advisable to activate [[Protect from Missiles]] against the [[rock thrower]]s and [[Protect from Melee]] while on the plateau. There, use a [[bucket]] on the cooking pot to get the [[goutweedy lump]]. There is a [[bucket]] spawn in a nearby hut if you forgot one.\n\nReturn to the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]] and talk to [[My Arm]] again, who will promptly eat the goutweed. He will then guide you to his farm on the roof of the stronghold to show you what he had tried to grow. Speak with him there, and he will give you a [[farming manual]] that he asks you to read.\n\n===Fertiliser===\n{{Needed|Three buckets of [[Ugthanki dung]] (obtainable with three empty [[bucket]]s and either [[red hot sauce]] or the [[Camulet]]), seven [[supercompost]]  and a [[spade]].}}\nYou now need to get the fertiliser for the goutweed: three [[bucket]]s of [[Ugthanki dung]] and seven [[supercompost]]. There are two ways to obtain [[Ugthanki dung]]; using [[red hot sauce]] or the [[Camulet]].\n\nGo to [[Pollnivneach]]. If you do not have a [[camulet]], talk to [[Ali the Kebab seller]] and ask him for his [[red hot sauce]]. Then head to [[Ali the Camel Man]]'s store and use the red hot sauce on the trough. A camel nearby should eat it and produce dung. Use the empty buckets on the dung; picking it up will result in a humorous message. \n\nIf the player has a camulet, the player can directly ask the camel to produce dung for them. The camel may or may not agree to the request so simply keep doing so until they agree to.\n\nOnce the camel dung is obtained, head back to the patch with a [[spade]] and seven [[supercompost]]. Use them all on the patch My Arm made. With the patch set, now you just need the herb.\n\n===Karamja===\n{{Needed|[[Machete]] (only if you lack 60% favour in [[Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup]])}}\n[[File:My Arm's Big Adventure boat journey.png|thumb|250px|The player and [[My Arm]] heading to [[Karamja]].]]\nHaving fertilised the patch, talk to My Arm again. He will want to venture with you to [[Tai Bwo Wannai]], as goutweed supposedly originates from there. You'll see a short [[cutscene]] on the docks of [[Ardougne]], followed by a scene on the ship. Once you arrive at [[Brimhaven]], My Arm will have already run off towards Tai Bwo Wannai. You can find him just east of [[Jiminua's Jungle Store]]. Talk to him there.\n\nWith at least 60% favour talk to [[Murcaily]]. Note that doing this will subtract this percentage from your total favour, so you may first want to reach 100% for the diary. Murcaily will initially give you a single [[hardy gout tuber]]. Then, a cutscene will follow in which My Arm causes havoc around the village in search of the tubers, and Murcaily will give you lots of [[hardy gout tubers]]. You will then return to [[Ardougne]].\n\n<gallery>\nMy Arm's Big Adventure jungle rumble.png|My Arm harasses [[Qutiedoll]] in his quest for Goutweed.\nMy Arm's Big Adventure jungle rumble 2.png|My Arm knocks away a [[broodoo victim]].\nMy Arm's Big Adventure jungle rumble 3.png|My Arm defeats the village's strongest warrior, [[Jagbakoba]], with a hefty punch.\n</gallery>\n\n===The Rocs===\n{{Needed|Combat equipment, the [[hardy gout tubers]], and 69 coins or a [[rake]], [[seed dibber]], [[spade]] and either [[plant cure]] or [[supercompost]]}}\n{{Instance}}\nSpeak with My Arm again - he suggests you go back to the bank to get some food because of some \"large birds\" on top of the mountain. You will need to bring the required farming tools or ensure your [[Tool Leprechaun (Larry)|tool leprechaun]] has them. You should also bring decent [[armour]], [[weaponry]] and [[food]].\n\nGo back to the top of the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]] where [[My Arm]] is. You can retrieve or purchase the tools from the nearby [[Tool Leprechaun (Larry)|tool leprechaun]] nearby.\n\nYou'll need to give My Arm the materials to plant his tubers, as if you were planting them yourself. Give him the tools in the following order;\n#[[Rake]] (this may break - simply retrieve the head and combine it with the handle, then hand it back to My Arm)\n#The [[hardy gout tubers]]\n#[[Seed dibber]]\n#[[Supercompost]] before it fully grows, or [[plant cure]] after it becomes diseased ( there is a chance for the plant to become diseased in the cutscene with the drunken dwarf so have a plant cure stored in the leprechaun just in case)\n\nWhen the goutweed is planted in step #3, the [[Drunken Dwarf]] will appear before getting unceremoniously thrown off the roof of the stronghold by My Arm, and then eaten by an [[Drunken dwarf's leg|unnamed troll child]].\n<gallery>\nMy Arm's Big Adventure farming.png|[[My Arm]] planting the [[hardy gout tubers]].\nDrunken dwarf punched off troll stronghold.png|My Arm attacks the [[Drunken Dwarf]], hurling him off the roof.\nMy Arm's Big Adventure unnamed troll child.png|An [[Drunken dwarf's leg|unnamed troll child]], soon to earn his name.\n</gallery>\nAfter the [[goutweed]] finishes growing, a bird will swoop down and attack the goutweed - it is only a level 75 [[Baby Roc]] and defeating it should be fairly easy.\n[[File:Fighting Giant Roc.png|thumb|250px|An ideal spot to fight the [[Giant Roc]]. Note that you can still get hurt by the wing blasts and ranged attacks.]]\n[[File:Giant Roc flinching.png|thumb|width=252x252|Possible flinching spot for the Giant Roc fight. First leave and return via the ladder to drag the Roc around the parasol, then run to this location to begin flinching.]]\nHowever, this will anger a far more dangerous level 172 [[Giant Roc]], who will immediately attack you. It uses both [[Melee]] and [[Ranged]] attacks. The melee attack will also force you backwards unless your back is against a rock or wall. Its ranged attacks may be dodged, although this requires precise timing. It is recommended to fight with [[Protect from Missiles]] activated and eat when required. The Giant Roc is more resistant to Ranged or Melee damage compared to Magic damage as shown by the respective defence roll formulas: (100 Defence Level + 9) x (0 + 64) = 6976 for melee/ranged (the Giant Roc has 0 defence bonuses for all melee styles and ranged) vs (1 Magic Level + 9) x (150 Magic defence bonus + 64) = 2140. With its lower defence roll against magic, it is advised to use [[Magic]] to damage it.  My Arm will also attack the bird, but his attacks only tend to hit 1 to 3, so don't rely on this.\n\nOnce it has been defeated, talk to My Arm again. You will now need to give him a [[spade]] to dig up the [[goutweed]]. If you forgot the spade, climb down the ladder and back up for the leprechaun to reappear. My Arm will then tell you to speak with Burntmeat for your great reward - you guessed it, a full [[inventory]] of [[Burnt food|burnt meat]]!\n\nTalk to My Arm one last time to complete the quest. He will offer you some better rewards.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = My Arm's Big Adventure\n|image = [[File:My Arm's Big Adventure reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Herblore|10,000}} [[Herblore]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Farming|5,000}} [[Farming]] experience\n**45{{X}}7  (315 total) additional {{SCP|Farming}} Farming experience while [[My Arm]] harvests his crop.\n*Access to a disease-free [[herb patch]] on top of the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]].

However, My Arm is very stubborn and refuses.\n*Depending on where your [[Player-owned house|house]] is, your character will reference its location and tell My Arm that he's never coming over.\n*If during the part of the quest where he shows you his farming patch you already have the [[Ugthanki dung]] in your inventory, he will point out that you stink.\n*[[Qutiedoll]] made his second appearance after the [[Draynor Bank Robbery]] during the Rumble in the Jungle [[cutscene]] when he was attacked by My Arm.\n*During a cutscene, My Arm throws the [[Drunken Dwarf]] off the roof of the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]] and an unnamed young troll comes up to him. After the quest, the troll's name has changed to [[Drunken Dwarf's Leg]].\n*During the first cutscene, if you try to take any of the [[items]] on the floor, the cutscene will stop and [[Burntmeat]] will tell you to start paying attention. If using a 3rd party client, it is possible to see the [[high alchemy]] value of these items are all 3gp - abnormal for items such as an [[abyssal whip]].\n*If you have completed the [[Swan Song]] [[quest]] and ask for the [[dragon equipment]] as your reward just after the first cutscene, you will complain that this is just like the [[Wise Old Man]] not giving you his [[blue partyhat]] at the end of the quest.\n*If you have completed the [[Swan Song]] quest, during the first cutscene on the ship My Arm will mention that trolls don't like the sea. The player then mentions the [[sea troll]]s fought during Swan Song. My Arm will not believe you, and say that they are not real trolls. If you haven't completed Swan Song, the player will mention [[river troll]]s instead.\n*My Arm uses a spade in his animation to harvest his healthy goutweed. Normally, players would harvest healthy herbs by picking them and clear dead herbs with a spade.\n*After the quest, My Arm grows goutweed continually next to the disease-free herb patch on the roof of the stronghold. If you try to pick the goutweed when it is fully grown, your character will say: \"This is My Arm's problem now\".\n*While My Arm is picking goutweed, if you gain a Farming level he will congratulate you.\n*When receiving the hardy gout tuber from Murcaily, the tuber will be placed in the last slot. If that slot is already occupied, your inventory will be reorganised to sort all empty spaces above the tubers.\n*After the quest, if you speak to Captain Barnaby in the Ardougne docks he will exclaim \"Oh no, it's you again!\".\n*When speaking about troll names being strange, My Arm states that humans also have strange names containing \"numbers and things wot aren't even words\". He will then mention the name of the player that My Arm last spoke to.\n**The stored player name is specific to each world, and will be lost in case the other player logs out, besides being wiped upon a server restart.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1652293913644810241|date=29 April 2023|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/zLlDD|archivedate=30 April 2023|quote=It's different on each world, and is wiped if the world reboots. Also, if the last player he'd seen has logged out, he won't be able to get their name anymore, so he'd just give the shorter message without a name.}} If no stored name is available, an abbreviated version of the same line of dialogue is shown.\n*During a cutscene in [[Tai Bwo Wannai]], My Arm says \"Da Rumble in da Jungle!\". This is a reference to The Rumble in the Jungle; an historic boxing event in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The fight saw Muhammad Ali defeat George Foreman.\n*The title of the quest is an innuendo.{{CiteVideo|author=Shauny|title=In the Games Industry - An interview with Mod Ash!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiBigfDrA4k&t=6060|timestamp=01:41:00|date=20 February 2020|site=}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{My Arm's Big Adventure}}"

You may wish to bring extra food.'''\n[[File:Drezel chathead.png|left]]\nTalk to [[Drezel]], where you left him at the end of [[Priest in Peril]] (beside the holy barrier to Morytania, under the temple). Drezel will give you three [[meat pie]]s and three [[apple pie]]s to take to [[Filliman Tarlock]]. He'll warn you about the aforementioned [[ghast]]s. Do not worry about the provided food being rotted as you won't actually end up giving Filliman the food. Pass through the [[Holy Barrier]], then cross the nearby bridge. Travel south to the gate permitting access to the [[Mort Myre Swamp]]. You must enter the [[Mort Myre Swamp]] through the gate, or Filliman will not appear.\n{{Map|3441,3337|r=8|mtype=square|align=right|caption=Location of the Grotto Tree.}}\n[[File:Nature Spirit - Nature Grotto.png|thumb|220px|The Grotto Tree.]]\nIgnore the warning and proceed into the swamp. Go south along the west river until you see the grotto tree. In this area, you will find the aforementioned [[ghast]]s who are barely visible spirits that will attempt to rot your food. They often miss, and if you run out of food, they will deal up to 3 typeless melee damage every time they attack. You will also [[Swamp decay|periodically lose]] 3 health every 2 minutes within the swamp. This will not happen on Filliman's island or in the [[Nature Grotto]]. Jump across the [[Bridge (Nature Grotto)|broken bridge]] to the grotto. You may fail and take upwards of 7 damage attempting to get across the bridge.\n\nIf you try to enter the grotto (only the small black hole in the grotto tree has the enter option), Filliman Tarlock will come out.\n\nIt turns out that he has died and is now a [[ghost]], so put your [[Amulet of ghostspeak]] on and talk to him. If you don't have your Amulet of ghostspeak on, he'll say something ghost-like and that will be the end of the conversation. He won't believe that he's dead, so take the [[washing bowl]] off the nearby table to find a [[mirror]] underneath. Take the mirror and use it on him. He will now believe that he is a ghost. After this, he tells you to find his [[Journal (Filliman Tarlock)|journal]]. Search the grotto tree to get it and give it to him. (If the journal is in your bank from a previous session, you'll get the 'you find nothing interesting.' message)\n\nFilliman will tell you that he wants to become a Nature Spirit, but he needs your help to complete the transformation. He will give you a [[Druidic spell|spell scroll]] that you can use to cast a [[Bloom]] spell.\n\n===Collecting the three items===\n{{Needed|Druidic spell (given to you by Filliman), a [[Silver sickle]], and your ghost speak amulet}}\n[[File:Nature Spirit - Drezel's blessing.gif|thumb|170px|[[Drezel]] blesses the player.]]\n\nYou now need to obtain the following three items:\n====Something with faith====\nGo back to [[Drezel]] and ask him to bless you.

Do '''not''' drop the [[A used spell|used spell]], as you will need it. Pick up the mushroom and show it to [[Filliman]], and he tells you that the mushroom is ''Something of nature''. If a Ghast turns your mushroom rotten, go back to the grotto to see Filliman. Click on the entrance to be given the enter option. You have to click on the actual entrance.\n*'''Note:''' Dropping the new spell card that is given to you, and asking for another will allow you to grab multiple spell cards in case you have no prayer.

Summon Filliman again if needed by trying to enter his grotto, '''then, while standing on the [[stone (Nature Spirit)#Orange|orange stone]]''', tell Filliman you think that you have solved the puzzle.

Filliman will turn into a Nature Spirit. He will then ask you to get a [[Silver sickle]]. Talk to him again to give Filliman your Silver sickle. He will bless it and give you back a [[Silver sickle (b)]] and tell you that you can bless other sickles in the future simply by dipping them in the grotto water. He will also give you a [[Druid pouch]] and tell you to kill three [[ghast]]s.\n\n===Killing the ghasts===\n{{Needed|A [[weapon]], [[Ghostspeak amulet]], [[druid pouch]], and [[prayer points]] (the more the better).}}\n[[File:Ghast dying.gif|thumb|120px|The [[ghast]] is freed after it is killed.]]\n*'''Note: '''You can only use the druid pouch after Filliman tells you how.

He will tell players about the information he has gathered about [[Verzik Vitur]] through mercenaries who've survived the [[Theatre of Blood]]; specifically, her unique abilities, which are unheard of among [[vampyre]]s, and the method in which she acquired them.\n\nOne of the observations the Mysterious Stranger has is from a mercenary who claimed a set of purple spiders eggs fell out of Verzik, and discovered the eggs were of a variant of [[nylocas]], a species of arachnid from the vampyre's homeworld of [[Vampyrium]], that has not been documented before.\n\n[[File:A Night at the Theatre - Ranis' coffin.png|thumb|left|Desecrating Ranis' grave.]]\nIn order to find out more information about them, you are asked to retrieve the corpse of [[Ranis Drakan]], who you killed during the events of [[A Taste of Hope]], so that the Stranger can relive his memories and attempt to find useful information.\n\n[[File:A Night at the Theatre - first memory.png|thumb|right|Ranis and Verzik talk about [[The Maiden of Sugadinti]].]]\nRanis Drakan is buried in a crypt beneath Ver Sinhaza, whose entrance can be found just north of the Stranger; bring a [[saw]] and an [[Ivandis flail]] or [[blisterwood flail]], as you'll need to kill a [[vyrewatch]]. Head down these stairs, and kill a vyrewatch to obtain a [[crypt key]], which is used to open the gate to Ranis' coffin. Search the coffin to cut off [[Ranis' head]], and return to the Stranger to hand him the head. The Stranger and you will then view one of Ranis' memories, where he gifts Verzik some spider eggs from a nest of [[araxyte]]s, another unique species of arachnids, north of [[Darkmeyer]], to assist her in her nylocas breeding program.\n\nAfter viewing the memory, the Stranger will ask you to investigate the [[Morytania Spider Cave|spider cave]] and recover some of their eggs. Head north-west of [[Slepe]] to the cave entrance found there, and enter the nest. Walk north towards the end of the nest to find a corpse just behind a large egg sac, and search it for a [[sticky note]]. When read, the note mentions [[Daer Krand]] will have some [[sulphuric acid]] that would be able to burn through the egg sac.\n\nDaer Krand can be found within the [[Sisterhood Sanctuary]], a large subterranean complex beneath [[Slepe]]. The entrance to the Sanctuary can be found in the building next to the church. Once players climb down the stairs, walk east towards the main area of the Sanctuary, and make your way upstairs in the Sanctuary's eastern wing, just north of [[The Nightmare]]'s arena. Talk to him about [[sulphuric acid]], and you'll inform him that his assistant has died trying to obtain some spider eggs. In exchange for bringing him news regarding his assistant, he will give you a vial of sulphuric acid.\n\n[[File:A Night at the Theatre - Egg Sac.png|thumb|The chamber housing the egg sac]]\nHead back to the spider cave and use the [[sulphuric acid]] on the egg sac to obtain some [[strange spider eggs]]. You will be attacked by multiple level 96 and 146 [[araxyte]]s, which can inflict [[venom]] starting at 8 damage. They cannot be killed without a [[Slayer]] level of 92 or higher, though they do not need to be fought and can be simply ignored with [[Protect from Melee]]. simply teleport to [[Ver Sinhaza]] using [[Drakan's medallion]], and cure your venom afterwards. Talk to the [[Mysterious Stranger]] to view more of Ranis' memories. In these memories, you will see the results of the [[araxyte]] eggs Verzik was gifted, where she uses them to breed two new variants of [[nylocas]]. Needing regenerative abilities to be bred onto the nylocas, Ranis advises Verzik to try using the bark of a [[hespori]], a rare carnivorous plant bred by [[Queen Efaritay]], who used them as living weapons against the vampyres in defence of [[Hallowvale]] during the [[God Wars]].\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nFile:A Night at the Theatre - second memory.png|Verzik shows Ranis a Nylocas Athanatos, a result of her Nylocas breeding program.\nFile:A Night at the Theatre - third memory.png|Verzik shows Ranis a Nylocas Vasilias, also a result of her breeding program.\n</gallery>\n\n==Get Into The Grove==\n{{Needed|[[Ghostspeak amulet]], any [[axe]], items (armour, food, antipoison) to kill a level 302 [[Hespori (A Night at the Theatre)|Hespori]], [[druid pouch]] recommended to protect food from [[ghast]]s}}\nTo find out more about the role of the hespori in the creation of the [[Theatre of Blood|Theatre]]'s monsters, you will need to acquire some bark from the plant. You will recall [[Filliman Tarlock#Spirit|Filliman Tarlock]], now a Nature Spirit, who might be able to help you find one. Contact the Nature Spirit [[Filliman Tarlock#Spirit|Filliman Tarlock]] in his [[Nature Grotto|grotto]] ([[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|BIP}}).\n\nMake your way to the [[Nature Grotto]] within [[Mort Myre Swamp]], and ask Filliman about the hespori. He explains that they are very rare, and that you can find one \"to the north-east, on a small island in the swamp\". Exit the Grotto and head east to an island across the swamp just west of [[Castle Drakan]]. Cross the stepping stone on the island's west side and attempt to chop the [[Hespori (A Night at the Theatre)|hespori]]. The fight is similar to the one against the [[hespori]] that players grow in the [[Farming Guild]]. One slight difference is that the [[Flower (A Night at the Theatre)|flowers]] in this fight do not always die in one hit. Should players die during the fight, their items will be placed in a [[gravestone]] just outside the instance, like a normal death.\n\n[[File:A Night at the Theatre - fighting hespori.png|thumb|280px|A player shortly after their promise not to damage the rare hespori.]]\nAfter killing the hespori, chop it to obtain a [[hespori bark]], and return to the [[Mysterious Stranger]] to view more of Ranis' memories, where Verzik shows Ranis the final result of her breeding program: the [[Nylocas Queen]]. Though small, it proceeds to bite her but surprisingly dies immediately afterwards, much to her disappointment.\n\nThough the Stranger concludes that the Nylocas Queen's bite was responsible for Verzik's new abilities, and that he has the necessary assets to work on weapons and techniques to use against her, you believe that there are some missing information that could clarify her transition. With no more memories from Ranis that prove useful, the Stranger is forced to enter the Theatre of Blood, and asks you to help him reach Verzik so he can make contact with her to gain her memories.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nA Night at the Theatre - fourth memory.png|Verzik talks to Ranis about \"the nylocas to end all nylocas\".\nA Night at the Theatre - final memory.png|Verzik shows Ranis the Queen Nylocas.\n</gallery>\n\n==The Curtain Opens== \n[[File:Fighting Verzik Vitur.png|thumb|A group of players fighting Verzik Vitur, a powerful [[vampyre]] noble.]]\nAt this point in the quest, you must complete the [[Theatre of Blood]] raid to assist the Mysterious Stranger. If you have already completed the Theatre of Blood (any mode) at least once, you will be given the option to skip this part of the quest.\n\nThough the normal raid is considered fairly difficult for the average player, you can complete the Theatre's Entry Mode, where the bosses have drastically reduced stats and less punishing mechanics. For a guide on how to complete the Theatre of Blood in Entry Mode, [[Theatre of Blood/Entry Mode|see here]].\n\nYou will have to defeat 6 bosses to progress:\n# [[The Maiden of Sugadinti]]\n# [[Pestilent Bloat]]\n# [[Nylocas Vasilias]]\n# [[Sotetseg]]\n# [[Xarpus]]\n# [[Verzik Vitur]]\n\nLike in the normal Theatre, the bosses must all be defeated in one session; leaving the raid means it must be started over. If played in entry mode, the bosses have significantly reduced stats, and players are given unlimited attempts to defeat the bosses.\n\nIn entry mode, your health and prayer are replenished after defeating each boss, meaning that it may be wise to avoid eating to full if a boss is almost dead. Keep this in mind as you progress through the Theatre.\n\nAfter defeating [[Verzik Vitur|Verzik]], she will transform into a bat and flee, but not before the Mysterious Stranger touches her and attempts to gain access to her memories. After receiving your rewards from completing the Theatre of Blood in the treasure vault, return to the Stranger at the Theatre's entrance via the [[Teleport crystal (Theatre of Blood)|teleport crystal]].\n\n==The Curtain Closes==\nTalk to the [[Mysterious Stranger]] once more, and you'll both view a memory not from Verzik, but from [[Vulcan Orvoros]], who was Verzik's doctor and wrote [[Verzik vitur - patient record|a record on her illness]] after the bite from the Nylocas Queen. It is revealed that after the nylocas bite, a [[Nylocas Queen]] had been growing inside of her, eventually emerging from her body and killing her. The horrified Doctor Orvoros, who witnessed the queen's birth, was killed shortly after.\n\nThe Stranger concludes the Verzik Vitur you fought in the Theatre was not actually Verzik, but the Nylocas Queen, who plans to overthrow the vampyres and rule Morytania in their stead. The Stranger will then explain his associates are all made up, and he has been on a mission for his master. Deeming you trustworthy, he will put you in contact with this master, who will explain that you've gathered all the information they need to combat the nylocas threat. He will then instruct the Stranger to reward you for the work you have done.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nA Night at the Theatre - doctor's memory.png|Verzik, now obese after the nylocas bite.\nA Night at the Theatre - the Nylocas Queen.png|The Nylocas Queen emerges from Verzik's body.\nA Night at the Theatre - the stranger.png|The player speaks to the Mysterious Master, [[Sugadinti]].\n</gallery>\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = A Night at the Theatre\n|image = [[File:A Night at the Theatre reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards =\n* Four [[Antique lamp (A Night at the Theatre)|antique lamps]], each offering 20,000 experience in {{SCP|Attack}} [[Attack]], {{SCP|Strength}} [[Strength]], {{SCP|Defence}} [[Defence]], {{SCP|Ranged}} [[Ranged]], {{SCP|Magic}} [[Magic]], or {{SCP|Hitpoints}} [[Hitpoints]] at level 50 or above.\n** If players completed the quest before 28 July 2021 and have already used the original two antique lamps that were rewarded, they will only receive two additional antique lamp upon re-completing the quest.\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 28 August 2024\n|update = Araxxor\n|poll = Araxyte Slayer Boss\n|change = Araxytes featured in the quest had their combat stats increased, and now require 92 [[Slayer]] in order to be harmed.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 1 March 2023\n|update = Theatre of Blood: Entry Mode Improvements\n|poll = New Skill: Community Consultation and Poll 78\n|change = Several changes to Entry Mode which made it (and therefore this quest) easier to complete, including unlimited retries, the removal of the 100,000 GP death fee, reduced boss HP scaling for larger parties, and parties gaining some supplies in the form of extra bandages after a wipe. \n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 30 November 2022\n|update = The Garden of Death & More\n|poll = Future Quests & Combat Achievement Rewards\n|change = 4 experience lamps are given after completing this quest instead of 3.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 28 July 2021\n|update = A Night At The Theatre Rework\n|poll = \n|change = The quest was completely reworked due to player feedback; originally, the quest consisted only of completing the Theatre of Blood and was automatically completed to any player who had completed a raid before the quest release.

Ask if you can look through the telescope and he says that it's broken. He tells you that a family of [[goblin (race)|goblin]]s has tampered with the telescope, so ask if you can help. He says that he needs some wood for the tripod, bronze for the tube, and glass for a new lens.\n\nOnce you have these three items, bring them back to the [[Observatory professor|professor]] who will take them from you. He then says that he needs a mould so that he can make a new lens.\n\n:'''Note:''' Make sure to talk to the professor three times and give him the [[molten glass]], [[bronze bar]] and three [[plank]]s before attempting to inspect the stove; otherwise, you will have to lure or kill the guard again for the key.\n\n===Retrieving the lens mould===\n'''''Items required:''' None.''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' An [[antipoison]] potion, energy potions, combat equipment (for lower levels) and food''\n\n:'''Note:''' If you don't have a form of [[antipoison]], you can pick up a [[superantipoison]] at a spawn in the corner of the south-eastern building near [[Greasycheeks]] and [[Smellytoes]]'s fire.\n\nGo down the stairs to the east of the reception room to find the [[Observatory Dungeon]] (the room with the stairs is directly east of the start point).\nOnce down the stairs, you must find the [[goblin kitchen key]]. It is commonly found in the south-eastern most chest although it can vary from person to person. Search any chests you pass on the way to the south-eastern chest just in case. Keep searching the chests (refer to the map) until you find the key. '''Once you search the correct chest, make sure you complete the dialogue for taking the key or else you will not receive it and will have to return to the chest.'''\n\nSometimes there may be a [[poisonous spider]] (level 31) inside the chest in which case run away quickly or you may get [[poison]]ed. \n\nNow that you've got the key, head to the kitchen gate (take the north-eastern path from the stair entrance and follow it west), and \"prod\" the [[Goblin guard|sleeping guard]] (level 42). He will wake up and attack you. You can either defeat him or get him stuck behind a wall.\n\n:'''Note:''' Getting him stuck behind a wall will allow you to go through the door. However, if you pass the goblin again, you will be attacked. Also, another goblin will spawn asleep. You can fight multiple goblins.\n\nOpen the kitchen gate (you will use the key and discard it), and then inspect the goblin stove. You determine the goblins are cooking something foul in the [[lens mould]]. Dump out the stew and bring this back to the professor.\n\nHis assistant will ask you not to give it to him, as last time the professor attempted to craft something, the explosion took a week to clean up. The professor agrees and gives you back the molten glass and mould.\n\nUse the molten glass with the lens mould to craft him a new [[observatory lens|lens]]. Give it back to the professor.

Now follow the north-west passage (past the kitchen) to find some stairs leading to the [[Observatory]] (the southern set of stairs on the map). There is also a chest north-east of the stairs to the [[Observatory]], which spawns infinite [[Antipoison(1)|Antipoison(1)]] vials, which you can combine to make full vials.\n\nGo up the stairs, and a [[cutscene]] will play.

Both the [[fairy ring]] with code {{Fairycode|DKS}} or the [[Eagle transport system|polar eagle]] are close to Olaf. He is miserable and damp and wants a favour from you. He will tell you about his attempt to live up to his family's reputation by becoming an expert explorer. Although he failed miserably, he wants to liven up his family's spirits and asks you to deliver some special carvings to his wife and son in [[Rellekka]], pretending they are from a faraway land. Unfortunately, he only has damp driftwood on him, as his ship was allegedly smashed thrice onto the rocks in a huge storm. He directs you to the [[windswept tree]] up the mountain path to the east, from which you could obtain some dry wood. He promises you the treasure map he had been carrying in return.\n\nGo up the snowy hill to the east and cut the windswept tree with any axe to get [[windswept logs]]. Once you bring the logs back, Olaf will make a [[crude carving]] for you to take to his wife [[Ingrid Hradson|Ingrid]], telling you to say it's tribal or something, and an even [[cruder carving]] to give his son [[Volf]] (because 'children love planks' in Olaf's experience) back in Rellekka.\n\n===To Rellekka===\nOlaf's wife, [[Ingrid Hradson]], is found wandering around the well, just south-east of the longhall in [[Rellekka]]. You can take the agility shortcut at the eastern fence if you have 57 Agility or you can teleport to Rellekka using an [[Enchanted lyre]] or [[Fremennik sea boots]]. After you give her the carving (which you call the \"Obscurian Tribal Artefact(tm)\" and describe it as 'An expensive, exotic gift from the far-flung and tropical shores of the Island of Obscurity,' although it's log with \"Olaf was here\" carved into it), she will give you a loaf of [[bread]] in return for your troubles.\n\nOlaf's son, [[Volf Olafson]], is further north by the [[Skulgrimen's Battle Gear|helmet shop]]. After you tell him that his father has sent him a very valuable gift from the Island of Obscurity, he exchanges the plank for a cooked [[shark]]. Save this in your inventory for later as Olaf will ask for food.\n\n[[File:Svens_last_map_read.png|thumb|220x220px|Sven's last map.]]\n\n===Cold, damp and hungry===\nTalk to Olaf again, whose fire seems to have gone out. He is freezing but would rather die than return to Rellekka so soon and admit his lie. He will ask you to make a fire with some [[damp planks]]. Use them on the [[embers]], and light it with your [[tinderbox]] (40 [[Firemaking]] required). After you make the fire, he will ask for food, having eaten nought but seaweed and biscuits for a week. Give him Volf's shark and he will admit the treasure map is probably cursed. He will give you [[Sven's last map|the last map]] of his grandfather, [[Sven the Helmsman]]. It supposedly leads to his last treasure hoard, but Olaf has been unable to decipher the runic inscriptions. He wishes you luck on your search and decides to remain where he is for now to practise his carving and possibly starve.\n\n'''Note:''' Olaf will ask for a piece of food from you in exchange for the map, but you will provide it regardless of whether or not you agree to this. If you have any food in your inventory that you don't want to lose (such as summer pies if you brought them for later, OR any food given to you by the quest NPC's), drop them before talking to Olaf and pick them up afterwards to prevent the risk of losing them. You only have to give him one piece of food.\n\nRead Sven's map. It depicts the precise area where you are. The '''X''' represents the tree up on the hill that you visited earlier. Dig next to the same [[windswept tree]] on the hill from earlier and you will fall into a [[Brine Rat Cavern|cave]].\n\n[[File:Brine_Rat_Cavern_map.png|thumb|220x220px|A detailed map of [[Brine Rat Cavern]].]]\n\n===The dank cave===\nThere is a boulder here that you may roll up to exit the cave. However, this is a one-way exit and using it will place you by Olaf. You will have to climb the hill and dig by the [[windswept tree]] in order to reenter. This is the same exit that you are sent to if you fall off of the slippery bridge later in the quest. Head east and north in the cave. Players may kill a [[brine rat]] en route to complete a task in the [[Medium Fremennik Diary]] (47 [[Slayer]] required).\n\n[[File:Olaf's_quest_puzzle_completed.png|thumb|left|220px|A picture of the completed puzzle.]]\n====The jolly rog-door====\nOnce at the picture wall, kill a level 40 [[Skeleton fremennik]] to get a [[Key (Olaf's Quest)|key]], or you can wait and kill one once you're in the room past the puzzle door (explained below). [[Crumble Undead]] is useful to kill the skeleton quickly.\n\nSearch the [[picture wall]] to find a puzzle on it that must be solved by pulling levers. The pieces must be rotated to get an image of a skull and crossbones. The top lever turns the top and left circles ''anticlockwise''. The left lever rotates the left and bottom circles. The bottom lever rotates the top and bottom circles. Finally, the lever on the right rotates the left and right circles. Once the image is correct, pull the horizontal lever at the very bottom.\n\nThe levers in order are: '''right''', '''up''', '''left''', '''down''', and then '''the very bottom'''.\n\n====The rotten walkway====\n[[File:Olaf's Quest walkway.png|thumb|220px|Attaching a rotten barrel to the walkway.]]\nInside the next room, you will find [[rope]]s and [[rotten barrel]]s that can be picked up. Take two barrels and, if you haven't brought them with you, six ropes. If you brought an [[agility potion]] or a [[summer pie]], drink or eat it here to boost your Agility level. Cross the bridge to the north-east and use a barrel on the broken section of the bridge to fix it. Do this again on the next broken section. You may slip and fall off the bridge. If this happens, you will appear just north of Olaf and will have to climb up the hill by the [[windswept tree]] and dig to enter the cave again.\n\nContrary to popular belief, there is no specific method to aid crossing the bridge, e.g. having a lower weight or waiting a few seconds in between each step. Simply having a higher [[Agility]] level will help increase the player's chance of successfully crossing the bridge. For example, a player with level 1 Agility will have a 33.3% chance of success, while a player with level 99 Agility will have a 117.6% chance of success (being guaranteed). If a player fails, their chance of success is increased by +2.4%.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1343522677676527617|date=28 December 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.vn/yWnjf|archivedate=30 December 2020|quote=At level 1 Agility, the first time they try a slippery bit, the success chance is 33.3%.\nAt level 99 Agility, it starts at 117.6% (guaranteed pass).\nInterpolate linearly between those.\nEvery time they fail, this increases by +2.4%, i.e. the level 1 player gets 35.7%, 38.1%, etc.}}\n\nIf these numbers are accurate, then <math>\\mathbb{P}(\\text{success}) = (0.86\\cdot\\text{Agility level}) + (2.4\\cdot\\#\\{\\text{failed attempts}\\}) + 32.47</math>. This equation shows that the lowest Agility level that guarantees crossing the walkway is 78. Each of the 12 tiles rolls a success chance when walking on to it, meaning the probability of successfully crossing the entire bridge is significantly reduced.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1599709945670213635|date=5 December 2022|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/UGNcs|archivedate=5 December 2022|quote=Looks like every tile, rather than being determined up front.}} Although players are guaranteed success at 78 Agility, there is only a ~50% probability of successfully crossing the entire walkway at 73 Agility despite the small difference in level.\n\n[[File:Brine_Rat_Gate.png|thumb|220px|The gate and its subsequent puzzle.]]\n\nThere is a locked gate in the middle of the bridge. Try to open it by using your key on it and selecting the right shape, and you will be shown five different locks. '''If you fall after you opened the gate you will have to collect a key again from a [[Skeleton fremennik]] nearby.''' Choose the one that matches the loop of your key, and the gate will open. If you lose your key, or fall off after the door, but before you complete the rest of the bridge, you will need to kill another Skeleton fremennik to get another key to be able to get back through the door.\n\n====Sven's skeletal sentinel====\n[[File:Fighting_Ulfric.png|thumb|250px|A player fighting Ulfric.]]\n\nOnce through the gate, make your way to the end of the rotten bridge. Again, you can fail, in which case you are washed out of the cave. The final section of the cavern contains a rotten shipwreck containing a treasure chest.\n\n[[File:Olaf's_Quest_-_Safespot.png|thumb|left|200px|Using Ulfric's grave as a safespot.]]\nAttempt to open the chest. A level 100 skeleton named Captain [[Ulfric]] will appear from a grave. He uses only [[melee]] and you may use his grave as an obstacle for a [[safespot]]. It is worth noting that he can teleport to you during the fight. Although the undead Fremennik is strong and accurate, he only has 60 [[Hitpoints]] and can be killed quickly.\n\nOne strategy is to only bring runes for [[Crumble Undead]] and/or a [[salve amulet]] (or its stronger variants) as both Ulfric and the [[skeleton fremennik]] fought earlier are [[undead]] and you can fight them with no armour using [[Protect from Melee]].\n\nAfter defeating Ulfric, search the chest again to claim Sven's treasure and finish the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!!'''{{Clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Olaf's Quest|image=[[File:Olaf's Quest reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=1|rewards=*{{SCP|Defence|12,000}} [[Defence]] [[experience]]\n*20,000 [[coins]]\n*4 cut [[ruby|rubies]]\n*Access to a cave where you can fight [[brine rat]]s.\n*A piece of [[Parchment (Olaf's Quest)|parchment]] telling you of other shipwrecks with more treasure.

The next day, they issued a fix that made it slightly easier to cross the bridge after each failed attempt.\n* When you examine the boulder that you can roll once in the [[Brine Rat Cavern]], the text is a reference to the game show ''{{Wp|Family Feud}}''.\n* After rolling the boulder that blocks the [[Brine Rat Cavern]] exit, its examine text becomes \"Keeps rolling, rolling, rolling...\" which is a reference to the song \"{{Wp|Rollin' (Limp Bizkit song)|Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)}}\" by the band {{Wp|Limp Bizkit}}.\n* Olaf's claim that 'children love planks' is likely a reference to the character Jonny 2x4 and his imaginary friend, Plank from the cartoon show Ed, Edd and Eddy.\n** His son Volf's name may also be a reference to another character, Rolf, from the same show.\n* If a player digs near the windswept tree before receiving Sven's map, they will get a message \"You shovel some snow. Congratulations!\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Olaf's Quest}}"

She is too worried to show you how to make an airtight pot because she is being pressured by a dwarf called [[Hammerspike Stoutbeard]] in the [[Dwarven Mines]].\n\n[[File:Dwarven Mine map.png|thumb|220px|Hammerspike and company is located on the far west end of [[Dwarven Mine]].]]\n\nGo to the Dwarven Mines (teleport using the [[Skills necklace]] to Mining Guild, or take a [[Keldagrim_minecart_system|minecart from Keldagrim]]). Head north-west to the westernmost cave past the anvils until you see Hammerspike Stoutbeard surrounded by [[dwarf gang member]]s (there is an Agility shortcut requiring 42 Agility) or (You can use a [[disk of returning]] to get to Hammerspike faster after you teleport to the mining guild. Ask him, \"Have you always been a gangster?\" He will tell you that he always wanted to be a druid.\n\nGo to [[Taverley]], and talk with [[Sanfew]], who is on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the central house with the herb icon. Ask him if he's taking any new initiates and accepts dwarves, and tell him that a dwarf you know wants to become one. He will allow Hammerspike to become a druid apprentice, but he wants you to give a [[Guthix rest|Guthix rest tea]] to [[Captain Bleemadge]] on top of [[White Wolf Mountain]] and organise a trip for Sanfew down to the [[Feldip Hills]].\n\nUse the [[bowl of hot water]] with an empty [[tea cup|teacup]] (one spawns in the building north of Sanfew), add one [[harralander]], two [[guam leaves]] and a [[marrentill]]. Once you have the tea, travel to the top of White Wolf Mountain (gnome glider is one way). Speak to [[Captain Bleemadge]], and give him the [[Guthix rest|tea]]. He will want some T.R.A.S.H. (Triple Redundant Aero Super Hawsers) for the trip down to the Feldip Hills. You may drop the bowl now.\n:'''Note:'''  If you have not completed [[The Grand Tree]], you must right-click and select the \"Talk to\" option for Bleemadge. Otherwise, he will not discuss the quest or accept the Guthix Rest.\n:'''Note:''' Low levels should be aware of [[White wolf|white wolves]] while travelling on the mountain. An aggressive level 73 [[Big Wolf]] spawns near Captain Bleemadge which may attack you, preventing you from finishing the dialogue.  Position Captain Bleemadge between yourself and the wolf to carry out the dialogue.\n\n===Kandarin===\n{{Needed|1 empty inventory space, 5 pigeon cages (can be obtained while in Ardougne), [[coins]], a [[Camelot teleport (tablet)|Camelot teletab]], an [[Ardougne teleport (tablet)|Ardougne teletab]], a [[Skills necklace]] or [[Combat bracelet]] to teleport to the [[Fishing Guild]], a [[ring of dueling]], a [[chisel]] and a hammer.|recommended=2 cut [[jade]]s, [[opal]]s and [[red topaz]]es. (2 extra uncuts of each gems can be provided by the gnome for {{NoCoins|500|c}} each. You will obtain 2 [[sapphire]]s which cannot be crushed while cutting so extras are not needed.}}\n\nTravel to the [[general store]] south of [[Catherby]] bank, and speak to [[Arhein]], who will ask for a [[weather report]]. Look on your map and go to the house with the water source north of the church in [[Seers' Village]] (teleport to Camelot and walk west). Speak with [[Phantuwti Fanstuwi Farsight]], located in the building with the water symbol, who is looking for a missing person and cannot do the weather forecast until she is found.\n\n[[File:Goblin Cave Map.png|thumb|220px|[[Petra]] is located in the same room where [[Bouncer (ghost)|Bouncer]] and [[Slagilith]] are found.]]\n\nEnter the [[Goblin Cave|cave]] east of the [[Fishing Guild]] entrance (teleport using a [[Skills necklace]]). Head north along the east wall until you come to a cave where [[Petra]] is trapped in a rock. Right-click and search the sculpture to find a message saying to speak to [[Wizard Cromperty]]. After finding the message, go to the north-east corner of [[Ardougne]] marketplace and speak to Wizard Cromperty about a girl stuck in some rock. He needs some [[iron oxide]] from a man in [[Port Khazard]]. If you don't have a [[hammer]] or [[chisel]] yet, you may acquire them in this building.\n:'''Note:''' If you have yet to get the five [[pigeon cage]]s, go to the house directly south of the northern bank in East Ardougne. The cages are located outside the house along the east wall. '''Note:''' If you have stored your gems in the bank, take them unnoted into your inventory now. \n\nGo to Port Khazard. Walk there, because you will have to come back in less than 20 minutes (the time to use the [[Fishing Trawler]] [[Grouping]] [[teleport]].) Alternatively, take the boat from South Ardougne to [[Brimhaven]] and then the [[charter]] boat to Port Khazard for 400 [[coins]]. (Alternatively, you can use the [[Ardougne cloak]] to teleport to the [[Ardougne Monastery]].) Talk to [[Tindel Marchant]] on the southern dock, and he will want his [[stodgy mattress]] stuffed for the iron oxide.\n\nGo to the [[Feldip Hills]] (You can get there via the following options: [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|aks}}, by taking a charter ship to [[Corsair Cove]] for 600 coins, via [[Feldip hills teleport]], teleporting via [[ring of dueling]] to [[Castle Wars]], or if you have 99 [[Hunter cape|Hunter]], teleporting to the [[red chinchompa]]s.), and talk to [[Rantz]], who is located at the quest icon in eastern Feldip Hills. He cannot do it because there is a \"small man\" causing a disturbance which is scaring the chompy birds. Tell him that you'll see what you can do. ''Lower combat level players should be aware that this area is full of ogres (level 53-63) who can deal a lot of damage to unarmoured players. This shouldn't pose too much of an issue for most players, as you won't spend too much time in areas where you're in danger of catching their attention, but it doesn't hurt to tread carefully.''\n\n[[File:One Small Favour Landing strip repaired.png|thumb|220px|The landing strip, fully repaired.]]\n\nGo west until you see a landing strip and [[Gnome glider]] with a gnome named [[Gnormadium Avlafrim]]. Talk to him, and he will tell you he needs to repair the landing strip. Search each of the eight landing lights for a [[gem]], cut it, and put it back in the landing lights. The gnome can sell you a [[chisel]] and up to 2 spare gems of each type for {{NoCoins|500|c}} each if you happen to crush them. Do not allow the gems to despawn, as you will have to bank to retrieve new ones.\n:'''Note:''' Bringing extra [[jade]] ({{NoCoins|{{GEP|Jade}}|c}}), [[opal]] ({{NoCoins|{{GEP|Opal}}|c}}) or [[red topaz]] ({{NoCoins|{{GEP|Red topaz}}|c}}) gems with you avoids the cost. Due to the high cost of red topaz, it maybe worthwhile to use up the gnome's stock first. (Players with high level crafting may also use the [[drop trick]] to obtain 2 extra red topaz gems for 500 coins before putting the cut gem back into the landing lights.)\n\n===Completing the favours===\n{{Needed|A [[stodgy mattress]], [[iron oxide]], an [[animate rock scroll]], the [[weather report]], an [[airtight pot]], [[breathing salts]], the [[herbal tincture]], [[chicken cage]]s, a [[sharpened axe]] and [[red mahogany log]]s, a good [[pickaxe]]/[[Weapons|weapon]], [[armour]] and some [[food]], a [[hammer]], a [[bronze bar]], an [[iron bar]], a [[steel bar]], 5 [[pigeon cage]]s|recommended=Runes for teleports to Ardougne, Camelot, and Lumbridge, transportation to Taverley, [[skills necklace]], [[skull sceptre]], and [[coins]] for transportation or some means of teleportation to get back to [[Shilo Village#Beginning the quest|Shilo Village]]. (Bring an extra piece of soft clay if you want to save some time during [[Swan Song]] later)}}\n\nTalk with Gnormadium to tell him the runway lights are fixed, then go back to [[Rantz]] to get the [[comfy mattress]]. Give the comfy mattress to [[Tindel]] in [[Port Khazard]] (a quick way to get to there is to use the [[Ardougne cloak]] to teleport to the [[Ardougne Monastery]], or the [[Fishing Trawler]] [[Grouping]] [[teleport]], if you didn't use it before) to get the [[iron oxide]]. Take the iron oxide to [[Wizard Cromperty]] in [[Ardougne]], and he will give you an [[animate rock scroll]].\n\nNow that you have the animate rock scroll, you will need to fight a level 92 rock monster that is weak to crush attacks and uses [[Melee]], so stop by the bank, get some [[food]], and equip some decent [[armour]] and a [[weapon]] or [[pickaxe]]. Fighting with a pickaxe is recommended; however, low levels can use [[Magic]] from the [[safespot]] just north of where it spawns, shown below. It is also possible to fight the monster head on with just 1-2 [[prayer potion]](s) and a pickaxe if you have at least 43 [[Prayer]] to use [[Protect from Melee]].\n\n====Goblin Cave & Slagilith====\n[[File:One Small Favour misfire.png|thumb|220px|The player misfires the spell and animates Slagilith.]]\n[[File:Slagilith fight.png|thumb|220px|right|A possible safespot for fighting Slagilith.]]\nHead back to the [[Goblin Cave]] near the [[Fishing Guild]], and hug the eastern wall until you come to the same room as before. Stand in front of the [[sculpture]] and read the [[animate rock scroll]] and kill the [[Slagilith]]. After killing him, stand back in front of the sculpture and read the scroll once more to release [[Petra]]. Make sure you talk to Petra so she goes back to Seer's Village before going to see Phantuwti. You may drop the animate rock scroll now.\n\nThe [[Slagilith]] has a maximum hit of 13, is hard to damage, and if you leave the room or take too long killing it, you will have to start the fight over. Travel back to the Goblin Cave south of Fishing Guild and cast the animation spell to begin the fight once again. \n\n'''Note:''' If you get a message saying, \"You don't feel that you should cast this with enemies around\", walk out of the room, and kill the [[bats]] around the entrance; then, return to the middle of the room and try again.\n\n====Seers' Village====\nGo to [[Seers' Village]] with 3 empty inventory spaces, best via Camelot teleport, and speak to [[Phantuwti]]. He is unable to give you a weather report because his weather vane is broken. You'll have to go through all the chat options, and then ask him, \"Why can't you get a clear picture?\" Then, ask, \"Which special Seers tools do you need?\" and \"What do you mean, 'special combination of items'?\" Finally, he'll tell you about his weather vane. Climb the ladder, head east, and climb another ladder to the roof of his house (36 [[Agility]] required). Search the weather vane, use a [[hammer]] with the weather vane, and search it again to get three [[broken vane parts]]. Go to an anvil (closest is across the street) with a [[bronze bar|bronze]], [[iron bar|iron]], and [[steel bar]], and use the parts of the weather vane with the anvil (30 [[Smithing]] required). Go back to the roof of the house, and put the [[weathervane pillar]], the [[directionals]], and the [[ornament]] back on the [[Seers weathervane]]. Talk to Phantuwti again for a (comically useless) [[weather report]].\n:If you lose the broken vane parts, you can recover them from Phantuwti for {{NoCoins|1000|c}}.\n\nTake the report to [[Arhein]] in [[Catherby]], who will send somebody to send T.R.A.S.H. to [[Captain Bleemadge]]. Talk to Captain Bleemadge on top of [[White Wolf Mountain]]. (low and mid-levels should beware of the levle 73 [[Big Wolf]] near Captain Bleemadge)\n\n'''Note:''' You can teleport to the [[Emir's Arena]] and use the nearby gnome glider.\n'''Note:''' You may now fly the glider to [[Feldip Hills]] to complete a medium Western Province task.\n\nTalk to [[Sanfew]] in [[Taverley]], and he will agree to let the dwarf become an initiate.\n\n====Dwarven Mine & Gang Fight====\n[[File:One Small Favour dwarf fight.png|thumb|220px|A tussle with Hammerspike's gang.]]\nTalk to [[Hammerspike]] in the [[Dwarven Mine]]. Predictably, he has \"changed his mind\" about becoming a druid. Talk to him again and he'll have his gang members attack you; they must be fought to continue the quest. There are three gang members (levelled in the mid-to-high 40s) in the room who will attack you at once and altogether can deal a fair amount of damage if you have no armour equipped, so come prepared for this battle (bring a weapon to end the fight quickly). '''Once they're dealt with, speak to Hammerspike again''', who will agree to stop harassing [[Tassie]].\n\nGo to [[Barbarian Village]] and talk to Tassie, who will give you some [[soft clay]] and teach you how to make [[pot lid]]s. Use the soft clay on the wheel to make an unfired pot lid and then use the [[unfired pot lid]] on the [[pottery oven]]. (Another pot lid is needed for [[Swan Song]], so you could make it now to save some time later.) You may take the [[pot]] at the Barbarian Village [[helmet shop]] to the north-west before you leave the village. \n\nGo to the [[Apothecary]] in [[Varrock]], and give him the pot and pot lid in return for the [[Breathing salts|salts]].\n\nGo back to [[Horvik]] the Varrock blacksmith, and give him the breathing salts and [[herbal tincture]]. '''Talk to him again to give him the [[pigeon cage]]s'''\n\nWith the '''chicken''' cages in your inventory, teleport to Lumbridge and go to [[Seth Groats]] (his farm is on the east side of the [[River Lum]]), and give him the [[chicken cage]]s.\n\nGo to the [[H.A.M. Hideout|H.A.M. headquarters]], and tell [[Johanhus]] in the south-eastern-most room that you've managed to swing that [[chicken]] deal; he will agree to release [[Jimmy the Chisel|Jimmy]].\n\nGo to [[Draynor Village]], and talk with [[Aggie]] the witch, who will agree to help [[Brian]].\n\nGo to [[Port Sarim]], and Brian will give you the [[sharpened axe]] (after pulling your leg a bit).\n\n====Finally back on Karamja====\nGo back to the [[Jungle Forester|forester]] just south of the entrance to [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]], and you receive some [[red mahogany logs]] in exchange for the sharpened axe. \n:'''Note:''' It would save a lot of money to teleport to Ardougne, go to the dock & pay [[Captain Barnaby]] {{NoCoins|30|c}} to get to Brimhaven. Or you may charter ship to Brimhaven from Port Sarim for {{NoCoins|1600|c}} and take the travel cart for {{NoCoins|200|c}} back to Shilo Village to reach the jungle forester). Or simply use fairy ring {{Fairycode|CKR}}. You can also run over to Rimmington to west and take a boat to Brimhaven for {{NoCoins|30|c}}\n\nSpeak with [[Yanni]] in Shilo Village to complete the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = One Small Favour\n|image = [[File:One Small Favour reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *Two [[Antique lamp (One Small Favour)|experience lamps]] giving 10,000 [[experience]] to any skill of your choice.

Salvatore's books.\n*Wizard Cromperty comments on the frequency with which people teleport into rock walls, saying that it can happen with just the smallest miscalculation. This may be a reference to the classic RPG Wizardry, which featured a teleport spell that, if cast with the wrong coordinates, could teleport you into a rock instead of the dungeon. This \"feature\" was notorious amongst Wizardry players, as it immediately killed your entire party.\n*Petra Fiyed is a wordplay on the word \"petrified,\" appropriately meaning \"turned to stone\".\n*When mentioning that the jungle foresters are looking for ways into the [[Kharazi Jungle]], Yanni mentions some [[Radimus Erkle|old timer]] from the [[Legends' Guild]] constantly sending new recruits there for no apparent reason, referencing the [[Legends' Quest]].\n\n{{One Small Favour}}"

''You do not need to read the notes, but they will give further lore.''\n\nPush the small monolith south and the north-west monolith west to access the gold [[Chest (The Path of Glouphrie, gold)|chest]], which contains the [[strongroom key]] Golrie mentioned earlier, as well as a [[crystal chime seed]]. Next, inspect the nearby [[singing bowl]] to create the [[crystal chime]], which is needed later in the quest.\n\n===Yewnock's Legacy===\n[[File:Argenthorg chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nPush the south-east monolith west, then use the [[strongroom key]] on the gate to the west to enter a room with a lectern and Yewnock's machine. The lectern contains a diary belonging to [[King Bolrie]], who formerly ruled the village; all three chapters will trigger cutscenes, which must be watched to move to the next step in the quest. \n\nThe cutscenes will show an [[advisor]] to King Bolrie, who is tired of the aging [[King Healthorg]]'s inaction against the army of [[General Khazard]]. The advisor suggests to Bolrie that he should campaign to replace the king of the Tree Gnome Stronghold; his opponent [[Argenthorg]], the crown prince, will be \"revealed\" to care more about humans than gnomes, giving the election to Bolrie. However, sensing foul play, Argenthorg will call upon [[Yewnock]] (son of [[Oaknock the Engineer]]) to activate an anti-illusion machine and expose the advisor as [[Glouphrie the Untrusted]]. Having been tricked, Bolrie is forced to stand down as a candidate to the throne and leave the Tree Gnome Stronghold, as well as abdicate the throne of the Tree Gnome Village.<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nThe Path of Glouphrie - Bolrie's Diary chapter 1.png|King Bolrie, frustrated at King Healthorg's inaction.\nThe Path of Glouphrie - Bolrie's Diary chapter 2.png|Campaign posters for the election to become king of the Tree Gnome Stronghold.\nThe Path of Glouphrie - Bolrie's Diary chapter 3 saboteur.png|A saboteur creates illusions of human food.\nThe Path of Glouphrie - Bolrie's Diary chapter 3 accused.png|Argenthorg, suspicious of the ruse, gets Yewnock to activate his anti-illusion machine.\nThe Path of Glouphrie - Bolrie's Diary chapter 3 exposed.png|King Bolrie's advisor is exposed as Glouphrie.\n</gallery>{{Colour-shape value|align=right}}\n====The Machine====\nYewnock's machine is similar to [[Oaknock's Machine]] in that players must solve a disc-based puzzle. This time, instead of being given a number you are given the value of the disc(s) to match. In the machine interface, the value of the discs '''inserted on the left''' need to '''add up to the same total value of the one(s) on the right'''. Use the table to calculate the total value of the disc(s) to match, and then solve as before. You will need to match two different values; first, a single shape that adds up to the value of the two displayed at the top, and second, two shapes that add up to the value of the single shape shown on the bottom. \n \nYewnock's exchanger, located directly next to Yewnock's machine, can be used by first inserting higher valued discs in exchange for multiple lower valued ones, or by combining two smaller discs into a bigger disc. The total value of the input and output will be the same. To operate the machine, click the desired disc in the inventory and then click the disc slot on the machine interface. Then click the double arrows between the two sides to view what will be exchanged. Note that the exchange has three tiers; exchanging a disc in the second slot will exchange for two shapes, and so on.\n\n''Any items left on the ground will disappear following the cutscene.''\n\nOnce the machine puzzle is successfully solved, a brief cutscene will play where Dumpling is revealed to be an evil creature. Head back up to the village and kill the evil creature, then talk to King Bolren. He will tell you of a gnome explorer named [[Longramble]], who went in search of the lost city, [[Arposandra]]. Though no one knows of his current whereabouts, King Bolren suggests asking [[Gianne jnr.|Aluft Gianne jnr.]] at the Grand Tree for help.\n\nUse the [[spirit tree]] and travel to the [[Grand Tree]]. Bank all unnecessary items (you may safely drop the shapes) and stock up on food and armour. If you're going to trade a [[tangled toad's legs]] for the [[mint cake]] (optional, but highly recommended as the tangled toad's legs is worth {{Coins|{{GEP|tangled toad's legs}}}} and a mint cake is worth {{Coins|{{GEP|mint cake}}}}), be sure to bring it along.<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"400\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:The Path of Glouphrie - Yewnock's machine interface.png|Operating Yewnock's machine\nFile:The Path of Glouphrie - Yewnock's machine exchanger.png|Operating Yewnock's exchanger\n</gallery>\n\n===Arbor Incomitata===\n{{Needed|A [[crossbow]] and [[mith grapple]], [[crystal chime]], combat equipment}}\n[[File:Longramble chathead.png|left|frameless]]\n[[File:The Path of Glouphrie - grappling to Longramble.png|thumb|300px|The player grapples toward Longramble's coordinates.]]\n[[File:The Path of Glouphrie - Incomitatus is healed.png|thumb|300px|Incomitatus is healed to perfect health.]]\nMake your way to the Grand Tree, and climb up the ladder once. In the north-west corner, speak to  [[Gianne jnr.]] to learn about Longramble's whereabouts. He will tell you that gnomes have been trying to deliver a dish of [[tangled toads' legs]] to him, but have not been able to reach him. He tells you the coordinates of the delivery is at 2 degrees 7 minutes south and 3 degrees 7 minutes west.\n\nThese coordinates will point toward the [[Galarpos Mountains]], just east of the [[Poison Waste]]. The quickest way to travel there is by using the [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|bkp}} and then running north-west; An alternative way to get there is by teleporting to [[Castle Wars]] via [[ring of dueling]], then heading south-west alongside the river. Equip a [[crossbow]] and [[mith grapple]], and cross to the mountain side via the tree in the middle of the river.\n\nSpeak to [[Longramble]], who believes Arposandra is close to the Poison Waste. If you brought a tangled toad's legs, he will automatically take it. After going through the dialogue, head further north, and you will feel a strange voice calling to you; this is the [[Spirit Tree (Incomitatus)|spirit tree]] nearby calling you, who tells you to call it [[Spirit Tree (Incomitatus)|Incomitatus]]. The tree's connection to the [[Anima Mundi]], the life force of the world, has been lost due to the toxic waste nearby corrupting its roots, and thus it has fallen ill.\n\nYou will mention that how Incomitatus speaks to you through the mind is reminiscent of [[Hazelmere]]'s, and will unintentionally contact him through Incomitatus as the conduit. He will sense that it is unwell, and conclude that the poison seeping into the soil is a byproduct of powerful magic having separated the Anima Mundi from its source. Hazelmere will suggest that healing the tree requires a spiritual cleansing by way of elven magic; he will then notice that you have a set of chimes that can purify it, and ask that you use it on the tree. This will heal Incomitatus, and connects it with the rest of the spirit trees. From this point forward, players can use the tree as a teleport option.\n===The Warped Depths===\n[[File:Terrorbird Guard 21 chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nHead west of the spirit tree, and then run south and enter the sewer entrance. You '''do not need''' to fight the [[Warped Tortoise]] at the entrance. ''Note that if you have not yet healed the spirit tree, warped tree roots will block your path after the second warped tortoise.'' [[File:Poison Waste dungeon map.png|thumb|A map of the Poison Waste Dungeon.]]\n\nOnce inside, you will need to run a considerable distance to the end of the dungeon; refer to the table below. It is recommended to wear a set of [[earmuffs]] '''''and''''' activate the [[Protect from Missiles]] prayer while traversing the dungeon, as this will negate almost all damage taken. Without ear protection, the [[Warped Terrorbird]]s inside will be able to '''hit through prayers''' with their ranged attacks.\n\nThere is a caged hallway at the half-way point where players are safe if they close the gate behind them. Players can also do so in the hallway just before entering the final area.\n\nThe level 121 [[Warped Tortoise]]s in the dungeon are not [[aggressive]], but the level 96 [[Warped Terrorbird]]s are, and they use frequent, highly accurate ranged attacks as well as a fairly accurate melee attack. [[Earmuffs]] or a [[slayer helmet]] will reduce the maximum hit of the ranged attacks, '''but the attacks will remain accurate''', so [[Protect from Missiles]] is recommended. Run past them, and avoid stepping on the tar on the ground, as it will turn off [[run energy]] and force you to walk, signaled by the game message {{Mes|You accidently step in some sticky tar!|colour=red|size=13}}{{Sic}}.\n\nHead to the end of the dungeon, in a room with a pit in the centre that is connected to three other rooms. To reach the room from the entrance:\n{| class=\"wikitable lighttable\"\n!Dungeon directions\n|-\n| Enter the sewer entrance.\n|-\n| Climb up the ladder.\n|-\n|Run all the way east. \n|-\n|Climb down the ladder.\n|-\n|Run north and climb up the ladder.\n|-\n|Run all the way west. \n|-\n|Enter the north room.

The terrorbirds use both melee and ranged, and will path towards the player. NOTE: You must be carrying the [[Crystal chime]] that you sang earlier to harm the birds. Lower-levelled players can use the pillars around the room to stop the other terrorbirds from attacking. Standing at the door until the three terrorbirds approach you will allow you to engage only one at a time. They may also be poisoned, envenomed, and flinched by trapping them behind the pillars.  They are weakest to crush attacks, and their ranged defence is the strongest defensive stat, but their melee and magic defence is fairly low, and they can be quickly eliminated with any attack style.\n\nAfter killing the Warped Terrorbirds, head towards the heavy door on the eastern side of the room to begin a cutscene showing two intelligent terrorbirds, [[Terrorbird Guard 21]] and [[Terrorbird Guard 72|72]], talking to each other. They will lament the boringness of the job, until they notice you and panic, pressing an alarm button that releases tar from the grills. You will try to run but become stuck in the tar, and toxic gases will begin to seep into the room, causing you to become hazy.\n\nAs you are about to blackout, [[Hazelmere]] will appear in the nick of time, managing to save you using a special seed pod that teleports both of you out to safety. Arriving at [[Hazelmere's island]], he will impart upon you his vision of the future, a vision that heavily involves you and signifies much to come.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nThe Path of Glouphrie - Terrorbird Guard panic.png|The Terrorbird Guards notice your presence.\nThe Path of Glouphrie - player trapped.png|You are tarred and gassed close to death.\nThe Path of Glouphrie - Hazelmere appears.png|Hazelmere arrives to rescue the player, activating a special seed pod.\n</gallery>\n\n'''Note :''' ''If there is not enough space in the inventory during completion, you can talk to [[Hazelmere]] again to receive the missing rewards.

Like other content from the immediate post-backup era (such as the [[God Wars Dungeon]] and [[Land of the Goblins]]), it was present in the archive's files but had not yet been added to the live game.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/718562692177469440|date=8 April 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/6NJWr|archivedate=25 May 2020|quote=Yes: Path of Glouphrie and Land of the Goblins. Also Halloween 2007, but we already used that.}}\n\nJagex first discussed potentially backporting the quest in the [[Update:Gielinor Gazette - February 2022|February 2022 edition of the Gielinor Gazette]]. During the [[April 2023 Game Jam]], it was revealed that [[Mod Ed]] was working on finishing the quest,{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ed|url=https://twitter.com/JagexEd/status/1651202744512831489|date=26 April 2023|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/Vn7vZ|archivedate=27 April 2023|quote=Hey @JagexLenny, things are pretty PoG over here! #OSRSGameJam}} and it was later announced during the [[Summer Summit 2023|2023 Summer Summit]] that the quest would be released sometime in September if it passed [[Poll:Summer Summit 2023 - Giga Poll|the poll]].\n\n===Differences from original version ===\nAlthough identical in premise and concept to the original quest, there are many differences in the ''Old School'' version: \n\nThere are differences in the story and dialogue compared to the original version of the quest.\n* Bolren's initial dialogue originally included significantly more information about Yewnock.\n* Golrie originally joked about his 'pet' hobgoblins when speaking to him if Roving Elves had been started.\n* Speaking to Golrie again after learning about the storeroom from him would originally cause him to talk about how useful items are always found in chests, and how once he explored a temple where the keys to locked doors were always in chests in the rooms he needed them, as a reference to {{wp|The Legend of Zelda}} series.\n[[File:King Healthorg turns to stone.gif|thumb|200px|The representation of King Healthorg's death.]]\n* Bolrie's diary is almost completely different from the original version:\n** In chapter 1, Bolrie was not originally depicted as a king, and did not wear a crown. His advisor originally spoke about how [[General Khazard]] now leads the humans, how they would spell disaster for the gnomes, and how Healthorg and Argenthorg would do nothing to stop them. The advisor advised Bolrie to pre-emptively attack Khazard to win the hearts of all gnomes, and that he would surely be crowned king of the Tree Gnome Stronghold if he did, at which point Bolrie imagined himself wearing a crown.\n** In chapter 2, Healthorg's death was symbolically depicted as him turning into a stone statue. Models for this still exist in the game cache.\n** In chapter 3, the conversation between Bolrie and Argenthorg was longer, with the additional dialogue depicting Argenthorg as more spoiled and childish. After being exposed, Glouphrie originally had a conversation with Bolrie where he spoke about his motivation to protect gnomes from humanity, and his intentions to found Arposandra. As the cutscene ended, Bolrie originally spoke about pleading with Yewnock to build an anti-illusion machine under the Tree Gnome Village to protect his family, explaining why it's there, which is otherwise unexplained. The cutscene also ended with Bolrie staring at a king statue for a beat before leaving the grand tree.\n* As it was originally mentioned in Bolrie's diary, the player character mentioned Arposandra to King Bolren, rather than vice-versa.\n* When talking about how to heal Incomitatus, Hazelmere originally explained that elven magic would be required to heal him because [[Seren]] is the divine aspect of the Anima Mundi that the elves revere.\n* When mind melding with Incomitatus, there was text explaining how his sickness feels. After being healed, Incomitatus had significantly more dialogue thanking the player and explaining what to do next.\n* The final cutscene in the sewers originally had more monologue from the player, as well as more graphical effects, and originally started upon peeking through the door rather than upon defeating all the Terrorbirds.\n** The original began with a zoom in through the doors window, and the Terrorbirds frantically jumped around and squawked before pressing the button.\n** After the gas jets are activated, clouds of gas would remain in the room for the rest of the cutscene, instead of disappearing immediately as in the ''Old School'' version.\n** Players would start being attacked by magic projectiles after the gas was activated, visibly lowering their health. The models and animations for the magic projectiles still exist in the game cache.\n* Hazelmere originally mentioned that the seed pod he used to rescue the player was [[Argento]]'s last gift to him.\n* Hazelmere did not originally start speaking to the player at the end of the quest, continuing to speak in their mind.\n\nMany NPCs have slightly different names compared to the original:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Original\n!Old School version\n|-\n|Small monolith\n|[[Small Monolith]]\n|-\n|Bolrie\n|[[King Bolrie]]\n|-\n|Spirit advisor\n|[[Advisor]]\n|-\n|Prince Argenthorg\n|[[Argenthorg]]\n|-\n|Yewnock the engineer\n|[[Yewnock the Engineer]]\n|-\n|Warped tortoise\n|[[Warped Tortoise]]\n|-\n|Warped terrorbird\n|[[Warped Terrorbird]]\n|-\n|Guard no. 21\n|[[Terrorbird Guard 21]]\n|-\n|Guard no. 72\n|[[Terrorbird Guard 72]]\n|}\n\nVarious changes were made to [[Warped Tortoise]]s and [[Warped Terrorbird]]s:\n* Warped creatures had their stats and drop tables rebalanced, alongside dropping the Old School-exclusive [[warped sceptre]].\n* Warped terrorbirds originally had different defensive stats based on their appearance.\n* Warped terrorbirds and warped tortoises were separate Slayer tasks that were automatically unlocked upon completion. In Old School RuneScape, both creatures share a single warped creature task, similar to [[spiritual creature]]s, and must be unlocked via the [[Slayer_Rewards#Unlock|Slayer Rewards]] shop. They also have their own [[Superior slayer monster|superior]] variants.\n* The crystal chime originally had to be used on the warped creatures to begin fighting them, rather than just attacking them with the item present. Additionally, they would change their appearance and examine text after the chime was used on them. Standard warped terrorbirds now use the appearance they had after having the crystal chime used on them, while the boss versions fought at the end of the quest look like the pre-chime version.\n* The crystal chime was originally made from the same [[crystal saw seed]], which meant players could not have both it and the [[crystal saw]], requiring a visit to the [[singing bowl]] in [[Brimstail's cave]] to switch. In ''Old School'', the chime is made from a separate item.\n* Some of the warped creatures are in different locations. For example, there was not originally a warped tortoise right at the entrance, instead it was found upstairs next to the other tortoise.\n\nThe rewards have been slightly updated:\n* The original only awarded one [[quest point]]; two are awarded in ''Old School''.\n* Rather than rewarding experience directly after completion of the quest, players are rewarded with four [[Magic lamp (The Path of Glouphrie)|magic lamps]] instead, allowing players to claim the experience at their discretion.\n*Originally, travelling via [[spirit tree]]s required the player to first travel to either the [[Gnome Stronghold]] or [[Tree Gnome Village (location)|Tree Gnome Village]] spirit trees before they could choose the destination they wanted to go. Completing the quest rewarded the ability to choose a destination from any spirit tree, but ''Old School'' had already implemented this in [[Update:Spirit trees, clues & more!|an update]] on [[1 May]] [[2014]]. Additionally, a new animation would play when using spirit trees after unlocking this ability during the quest. This is not present in ''Old School RuneScape'', but can be found within the game cache.\n\nOther miscellaneous changes:\n* The position of monoliths in the storeroom is now saved between visits, instead of resetting every time like in the original version. \n* The room with Yewnock's machine is now instanced like the rest of the storeroom.\n* Watching the cutscenes in [[Bolrie]]'s diary is now required, rather than optional.\n*Two [[unlisted music tracks]] were present in the original version, but not the Old School RuneScape version.\n** A [[rsw:File:Mind Melding.ogg|creepy unlisted music track]] played when mind melding with Incomitatus.\n** An [[rsw:File:The Terrorbirds.ogg|unlisted music track]] originally played when observing the terrorbirds at the end of the quest, before changing back to [[Terrorbird Tussle]] after being spotted.\n* Walking close to the sewer exit would originally automatically take you outside the dungeon, instead of needing to select \"Exit\".\n* The [[Poison Waste Dungeon]] did not originally contain any gas jets outside of the ones that appear in the cutscene at the end of the quest. As a result, their ability to damage players is exclusive to ''Old School''.\n\n==Developers==\n'''Original'''\n*'''Developers:''' Mod Chihiro (Project Lead), Mod Tytn\n*'''Graphics:''' Kavi M, Matthew M, Mod Paul B, Matthew S\n*'''Quality Assurance:''' Nick C\n*'''QuestHelp:''' Kevin D, Mod Maylea\n*'''Audio:''' Mod Dan A\n'''''Old School RuneScape'''''\n*'''Developer(s):''' Mod Ed\n\n==Trivia==\n* The Path of Glouphrie was [[Backporting|ported from the original game]] with significant changes, as it was already nearly complete in the [[August 2007 Archive of RuneScape]]. It is the second quest to receive this treatment, after [[Land of the Goblins]].\n**A bug present in the archived version also had to be fixed before The Path of Glouphrie could be released, which enabled players to claim the experience reward for this quest an indefinite number of times.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1702359492908687660|date=16 September 2023|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20230916204052/https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1702359492908687660|archivedate=16 September 2023|quote=(...)

Yes he can!\" This is a reference to Oaknock's examine text, which is a reference to the children's TV show, ''{{wp|Bob the Builder}}''.\n* Longramble mentions searching for the edge of the world in a conversation; this is a reference to the old myth of the world being flat.\n* Gianne Jr. mentions that he couldn't find the coordinates of the delivery to Longramble the explorer on Doogle Maps (since his maps are written on dried [[doogle leaves]]). This is a reference to ''{{wp|Google Maps}}''.\n* When speaking with Longramble for the first time, your character says: \"Mr Longramble, I presume?\" This mirrors a famous quote supposedly said by explorer [[wikipedia:Henry_Morton_Stanley|Henry Morton Stanley]] when he found the missionary [[wikipedia:David_Livingstone#Stanley_meeting|Dr David Livingstone]] in modern Tanzania after he had lost contact with the outside world.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{The Path of Glouphrie}}\n[[Category:Backported and extracted content]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Path of Glouphrie, The}}"

If you have not already built a [[landing site]] by the city entrance, it is recommended to do so for quick access via the [[Quetzal Transport System]].\n\n[[File:Perilous Moons - a dispute.png|thumb|300px|A dispute at the entrance to Cam Torum.]]\nAt the bridge near the entrance, [[Zuma]] and [[Attala]] will be in argument. Zuma wishes to enter the dwarven city to document some newly discovered ruins but Attala refuses due to the risks involved. A guard will come out of the gates and inform Attala that a creature has escaped through the mountain's outflow spring and that they have no spare men to deal with it.\n\nAgree to help Attala and make your way to the outflow spring. Players with level 47 [[Agility]] may walk east over the bridge, then head north to climb a set of [[Rocks (Ralos' Rise)|rocks]] to reach the outflow spring. Players without level 47 Agility must use the western path and run all the way north towards [[the Teomat]], then back around to the south-east of the [[exposed altar]]. If players have already built the Cam Torum [[landing site]], they may also use [[Renu]] to fly to the Teomat and then run to the south-east of the exposed altar.\n\nOnce at the spring, a [[Sulphur Nagua (Perilous Moons)|Sulphur Nagua]] will be wandering around the area. It is level 98 and hits twice per attack. Its attacks can be completely blocked using [[Protect from Melee]]. After killing it, return to Attala, who will agree to let you in with Zuma as long as you keep him in check. Enter Cam Torum through the entrance and travel all the way north to the ruins entrance. Speak to [[Jessamine]] and ask if you could be of any help with the dig. She will then give you permission to enter the city.\n\n===Remnants of the Old Ones===\n[[File:Nahta chathead.png|left|frameless|width=110x110]]\nEnter the ruins to find yourself in an antechamber with a large black monolith in the centre. Speak to [[Attala]], [[Zuma]], and [[Jessamine]], in that order. Jessamine will tell you that inscriptions on the murals are written in the language of the [[Old Ones]], and ask you to help her set up camps in the surrounding caverns.\n[[File:Perilous Moons - mural in Neypotzli.png|thumb|300px|A mural found in the ruins.]]\nTake from the [[Building Supplies (scenery)|building supplies]] just to the west of Jessamine to obtain a [[hammer]], [[saw]], and three [[building supplies]]. To build the campsites, run to the cooking range symbol [[File:Cooking range icon.png]] on the [[minimap]] in each of the following rooms, using entrances in the corners of the antechamber:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Caverns\n!Cavern\n!Entrance\n|-\n|Earthbound Cavern\n|North-west\n|-\n|Streambound Cavern\n|North-east\n|-\n|Ancient Prison\n|South-west corner\n|}\nBeware of aggressive [[Sulphur Nagua]] in the Ancient Prison.\n\nEach time you build a campsite, your [[run energy]] will be fully restored. After building all three campsites, speak to Jessamine, who has finished translating the inscriptions. She will reveal that the ruins are called \"[[Neypotzli]],\" and that emissaries of unknown origins have been sealed here. Ask what to do, and she will give you a [[water talisman]] and [[earth talisman]], telling you that the power of \"earth and streams\" were used to seal the emissaries away. Attala will recognise the talismans, and ask that you bring them to [[Nahta]].\n\nNahta runs the magic shop, [[The Runic Emporium]], near the centre of the city and marked with a magic shop symbol [[File:Magic shop icon.png]]. She will enchant the talismans to react to [[naguanil]] magic, and ask that you take them to the [[Blacksmith (Cam Torum)|blacksmith]].\n\nSpeak to the blacksmith, found north-east of Nahta, in the city's forge, and a cutscene will play in which he will infuse the talismans. Return to Neypotzli with the talismans and speak to Attala; she will instruct you to use the talismans to guide you towards the location (within the dungeon) where earth and water runic energy resonate the most. This location differs for each player. \n\nUse the east/west pulling talisman to find the \"column\" and the north/south pulling talisman to find the \"row\" of the area you're searching in. Finding the location to travel to might require entering multiple doors. Use the [[world map]] to figure out possible connections between rooms. Rarely, it is possible to be required to go to the [[Lunar Chest]]'s room in order to find the correct location.\n\n==== The ancient warden ====\n[[File:Eyatlalli chathead.png|left|frameless]]When you are at the correct location and attempt to click either talisman, a [[nagua]] named [[Eyatlalli]] will appear before you. She will tell you that Neypotzli is a prison created to seal the [[Moons of Peril]], a trio of powerful [[nagua]]. The ground will then shake and she will disappear; return to the antechamber and talk to the group to find Zuma missing. Eyatlalli will reappear, telling you that the icosahedron has been disturbed and must be re-infused with a ritual.\n\nIf you didn't bring the required tools for the quest, enter the Earthbound Cavern and search the supply crates next to the campsites you set up earlier. Obtain the [[big fishing net]], [[rope]], [[pestle and mortar]], and [[knife]] if needed.\n\nWith the tools, collect a [[moonlight grub]] from the [[grubby sapling]] found slightly up the path in the Streambound Cavern, and use the pestle and mortar to grind it into [[moonlight grub paste]]. Run slightly north-east, towards a fishing spot on the bridge, and catch a [[raw bream]]. Use the knife on it to obtain the [[bream scales]].\n\nNext, enter the Earthbound Cavern and head to the Hunter icon. Set a lizard trap on two adjacent rocks to create a trap between them, then rustle the bushes on either side of them until a [[Moss Lizard|moss lizard]] is caught. Use the knife on the [[raw moss lizard]] to obtain a [[moss lizard tail]].\n\nReturn to Eyatlalli with all three items. The Eyatlalli is now located in the central antechamber, return and speak with Attala to continue the dialogue and then speak with the Eyatlalli with the items. The ritual will be set in motion, but she will need to have you distract the Moons of Peril whilst she does so. Now you have to defeat three nagua, which are dangerous and each have different mechanics.\n\n===The Moons of Peril===\n[[File:Eyatlalli's glyph.png|left|frameless|width=80x80]]\nThe three Moons of Peril must now be defeated. Each Moon is located in its own room within the dungeon. The Moons can be fought in any order.  \n\nEach Moon will appear in the centre of the room, surrounded by moon-shaped circles on the floor. One of the circles will be highlighted with Eyatlalli's protection; while attacking the boss, players must stand in the highlighted circle on the floor to prevent the boss from dealing constant damage every tick. Damage taken while not standing in the right place starts at 1 per tick, doubling over time up to 16. The circle highlighted with Eyatlalli's protection will move clockwise to the next circle every '''two''' attacks.   \n\nWhen Eyatlalli's protection reaches the full or empty moon circles on the floor, the Moon will spawn a special attack. Refer to the sections below for information on the special attacks for each Moon. \n\nAll of the Moons' standard attacks are melee-based, and each Moon is weak to different melee styles (listed below). However, they all have low Defence level (60), so players with high combat skills and decent melee gear should be able to take them out without needing to change styles. The moons have very high ranged and magic defence, and are immune to [[venom]]/[[poison]]. Protection prayers do not impact the damage taken in any way, and are thus unnecessary. \n\nThroughout the fight, Prayer can be restored by catching [[Moonlight moth|moonlight moths]] with a [[butterfly net]] (75 [[Hunter]]) or [[Barehanded impling|barehanded]] (85 Hunter) outside of the boss rooms in the Earthbound Cavern. Prior to heading in to each boss, you may restore your run energy at the camp and stock up on combat supplies. [[Raw moss lizard|Raw moss lizards]] can be caught using [[rope]] on the rocks and cooked at the camp for a source of food. The amount of Hitpoints [[Cooked moss lizard|cooked moss lizards]] restore is 1/3rd of the player's Cooking level or 1/2 of their Hunter level, whichever heals less.  \n\n====The Blue Moon====\nThe [[Blue Moon]] can be found by taking the north-western path to the Earthbound Cavern. Once in the room, you can click on the Hunter icon on the [[minimap]] to run past the [[wyrmlings]] and down the stairs near the entrance of the boss room. Once ready, head into the room directly east of the Hunter icon to go into the room prior to the boss. The Moon is weak to '''crush'''.[[File:Fighting the Blue Moon.png|thumb|300px|Battling the Blue Moon.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Special attacks\n!Attack\n!Mechanics\n!Method\n|-\n|'''Weapon Freeze'''\n|The Moon unequips your weapon and puts it in a block of ice. Ice spikes will also spawn on the floor.\n|Punch the ice block to break it, avoiding the ice spikes that appear.\n|-\n|'''Brazier'''\n|The Moon extinguishes two braziers at the edges of the room, and spawns moving tornadoes which disable run energy.\n|Run to each brazier to light it (no tinderbox needed), avoiding the moving tornadoes.\n|}\nOnce the boss is defeated, you are teleported to a camp next to the room near the [[Blood Moon]] boss. If you log out while your weapon is taken during the weapon freeze phase, it will not be equipped when you log back in. To fix this, simply re-enter the fight.\n\n====The Blood Moon====\n[[File:Fighting the Blood Moon.png|thumb|300px|Battling the Blood Moon.]]\nThe [[Blood Moon]] can be found by taking the south-western path to the Ancient Prison. The Moon is weak to '''slash'''. Contrary to some claims, it is fine to eat; this will not heal the boss. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Special attacks\n!Attack\n!Mechanics\n!Method\n|-\n|'''Raining Blood'''\n|The Moon will disappear and rain blood from above, forming pools of blood throughout the room.\n|Simply move off of the blood pools on the floor.\n|-\n|'''Blood Jaguar'''\n|Eight [[Blood jaguar|blood jaguars]] will spawn around the room, as well as a square of blood pools.\n|Run to the highlighted jaguar and attack it, remaining in the protected circle in front of it. Avoid damage by stepping one tile away from the jaguar (towards the boss) right before the jaguar attacks.\n|}\n\n====The Eclipse Moon====\nThe [[Eclipse Moon]] can be found by taking the north-eastern path to the Streambound Cavern. Head upstairs past the camp, past the wooden bridge and go west at the fork to head to the boss room at the southern portion of the area. The Moon is weak to '''stab'''.[[File:Fighting the Eclipse Moon.png|thumb|300px|Battling the Eclipse Moon]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Special attacks\n!Attack\n!Mechanics\n!Method\n|-\n|'''Eclipse Shield'''\n|The Moon will spawn a moon shield and begins attacking rapidly with rays of light. The shield will move quickly around the boss in a circle.\n|Keep the moon shield between you and the boss to prevent damage from the attacks.\n|-\n|'''Mimic'''\n|You are teleported to the centre of the room and frozen in place. Clones of the Moon will spawn around you, attacking you.\n|Face your character toward each clone as it spawns to prevent damage. The simplest method is to click the tile below or behind each clone as it spawns.\n|}\n\n===Finishing up===\nOnce all three Moons have been defeated, return to the Antechamber and speak with Attala, Zuma, and Jessamine. '''All''' of them must be talked to in order to proceed. Finish the quest by speaking with Eyatlalli.  \n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Perilous Moons\n|image = \n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n* {{SCP|Slayer|40,000|link=yes}} experience\n* {{SCP|Runecraft|5,000|link=yes}} experience\n* {{SCP|Hunter|5,000|link=yes}} experience\n* {{SCP|Fishing|5,000|link=yes}} experience\n* Access to [[Neypotzli]] and the [[Moons of Peril]]\n\nIn addition, completing the quest counts as a normal defeat of the Moons of Peril, allowing the player to loot the [[Lunar Chest]] for further rewards.\n}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Unlock details\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Music track\n|-\n|[[Lost to Time]]\n|\n|[[File:Lost to Time.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[The Moons of Ruin]]\n|\n|[[File:The Moons of Ruin.ogg]]\n|}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*  When talking to Jessamine about the murals, if the player has completed [[The Garden of Death]], they will offer to help translate the language of the Old Ones. However, she will decline the offer.\n* After placing the scales, lizard tail, and paste on their respective positions of the moon, Eyatlalli will ask the player for \"one more small favour\". The player will say, \"Please, no...\", which is a reference to [[One Small Favour]]. The player will say this even if they have not started that quest.{{Fact}}\n\n{{Perilous Moons}}"

He wants you to get some [[Karamjan rum]] before he'll tell you the location of the treasure. If you have already completed the quest [[Rum Deal]], your character will ask Redbeard Frank if Braindead Rum will work.\n\nWalk south on the docks to see three sailors (NOT the [[Monk of Entrana|Monks of Entrana]]). Talk to any one of these sailors to board the ship to [[Karamja]] for 30 [[coins]] (or, using a [[Ring of Charos (a)]], persuade them to let you sail for free). \n\n===The island of Karamja===\n{{Needed|10 [[banana]]s and 30 [[coins]].}}\n\nWhen you arrive in Karamja, follow the path to the west and enter the first hut on the right. \n\nHere you will find [[Luthas]]. Ask for a job, and he will hire you as his worker. Agree to help him. Enter the banana plantation beside his house and pick 10 bananas from the trees.  \n\n'''Note:''' If you mention the customs officer, he says that his crates are not searched.  \n\n'''''Note'':''' Picking 5 bananas is an [[Karamja Diary#Easy|easy Karamja Diary]] task. \n\nWhen you have collected 10 [[bananas]], go to the bar ([[Karamja Wines, Spirits, and Beers]]) opposite the banana plantation \n\nOnce at [[Karamja Wines, Spirits, and Beers]] you will find the bartender [[Zembo]]. Trade with him to buy one [[Karamjan rum]] for 30 coins. \n\n'''Note:''' Do '''not''' leave the island with the rum in your inventory. If you do, the [[Customs officer|officers]] will take your rum away, as [[Asgarnia]] has banned the import of intoxicating spirits. If you try to [[Teleportation|teleport]] off the island, the bottle will break. The bottle will also break if you accept a [[Random events|random event]] where you are temporarily teleported to the event location to perform the task. \n\nNow you should have 10 [[bananas]] and 1 [[Karamjan rum]].\n\nGo back to [[Luthas]] hut and find the [[Crate (Pirate's Treasure)|crate]] on the side of his hut. Here you will use the [[Karamjan rum]] on the [[Crate (Pirate's Treasure)|crate]] to hide it (''If you get a message saying \"Why would I want to do that?\" try asking for employment, then hide the [[Karamjan rum]])''. \n\nNow you must get all 10 bananas into the [[Crate (Pirate's Treasure)|crate]]. You can use the \"Fill-Crate\" option to expedite this process.\n\nOnce the crate is full, '''talk to [[Luthas]]'''. He will pay you 30 coins. Ask him where the crate goes, and he will tell you they go to [[Wydin]], who owns the food store in [[Port Sarim]]. You can use Luthas' payment to pay your fare back to Port Sarim (or, once you've been searched, you can use a Ring of Charos (a) to persuade the customs officer to let you ride for free). Travel back to Port Sarim.\n\n===Back at Port Sarim===\n{{Needed|[[White apron]]|recommended=a teleport to [[Varrock Teleport|Varrock]] and [[Falador Teleport|Falador]].}}\n\nOnce you are in Port Sarim, make a quick stop at [[Gerrant's Fishy Business|the fishing shop]] just to the west. Hanging on the back wall is a [[white apron]]. Take it and wear it ''(the white apron in the back of Wydin's store is inaccessible at this point).'' \n\nTalk to [[Wydin]] at his [[Wydin's Food Store|food store]] directly south of the fishing shop, and ask him for a job. He will agree if you're wearing your [[white apron]]. Enter the back room and search the crate with a [[banana]] on top of it. You will find the rum. '''Do not teleport with it in your inventory.''' Head back to [[Redbeard Frank]] and give him the drink.\n\nFrank will give you a [[Chest key (Pirate's Treasure)|key]] to the chest found upstairs in [[Varrock|Varrock's]] [[Blue Moon Inn]]. Travel or teleport to [[Varrock]], and head to the [[Blue Moon Inn]] (it's the pub located just north of the city's southern gate). Go upstairs and find the chest in the room at the end of the hall. Use the key on the chest to find a [[pirate message]]. It will give you a clue to the treasure's location. '''Be sure to ''read the clue'''''. Now, travel or teleport to [[Falador]], the ''city of the White Knights''.\n\n===Buried treasure===\n{{Needed|[[Spade]], [[pirate message]]|recommended=A [[weapon]].}}\n[[File:Pirate's Treasure - Buried treasure location.png|thumb|284x284px|Location of the buried treasure.]]\n\nOnce in Falador, grab a spade from the estate agency just south-west of the park. With the spade in your inventory, head to the park. Find the statue of [[Saradomin]] in the middle of the park, and notice where it's pointing. Note the configuration of the dirt, which vaguely makes an X. Stand in the middle of the dirt \"X\" and dig.\n\nAn angry level-4 [[gardener]] will appear and attack you. Kill him, or run out of the park, and dig again in the same spot to get a casket and complete the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations, Quest Complete!'''\n\n==Reward==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Pirate's Treasure\n|image = [[File:Pirate's Treasure reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards =\n*Ability to use the pay-fare option to and from [[Karamja]].\n*Access to [[Casket (Pirate's Treasure)|One-Eyed Hector's Treasure Chest]] (contains a [[gold ring]], an [[emerald]], and 450 [[coins]]).\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Pirate's Treasure is required for the following:\n*[[Cabin Fever]]\n\n== Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*When using the Casket received as a reward for completing the quest on Redbeard Frank, the player's character offers to share the treasure with him, but he refuses and insists that the player should keep all of it for their own as they have earned it.\n*When the quest was first released, the [[Karamja rum]] was tradeable and the bottles would not break if players tried to teleport. Some players simply bought a whole load of rum and sold it to players doing the quest, allowing them to skip a large part of it. When this was posted on fan forums, a Jagex developer saw it and the problem was soon corrected.\n*If you have completed [[Rum Deal]] prior to starting this quest, you will ask Redbeard Frank if [[Braindeath 'Rum']] will do instead instead of Karamjan rum, in which case Redbeard refuses immediately, calling it 'swill'.\n*If you give Redbeard Frank some [[Karamjan rum (sliced banana)|Karamja rum with sliced banana]] in it, he will take it at first, but will give it back when talked to again, stating that he doesn't like bananas in his rum.\n*If you give Redbeard Frank some [[Karamjan rum (banana)|Karamja rum with a banana]] stuffed in in, he will take it at first, but will give it back, saying \"Arr - this here rum's got a banana stuck in it!\".\n*As the completed quest journal text indicates, it was at one time necessary to complete the quest in order to travel between Port Sarim and Musa Point, as well as to continue to work for Luthas.\n\n{{Pirate's Treasure}}"

Ask him what happened to his daughter and offer to help. He'll tell you to talk to his wife about getting some sort of protection against the plague. His wife, [[Alrena]], is inside the house or wandering outside. She'll tell you she can make a [[gas mask]] if you get her some [[dwellberries]].\n\nDwellberries can be most easily found in [[McGrubor's Wood]], which is north-east of Edmond's home. The area is fenced off, but can be entered via a loose railing found on the northern side. You can also purchase dwellberries from NPC vendors near the [[Grand Tree]], or on the [[Grand Exchange]]. Give Alrena a bunch of dwellberries and she'll give you a mask. There are spare masks in the cupboard.\n\n'''Make sure to take the [[Picture]] of [[Elena]] from inside the house while you're there.'''\n\nTalk to Edmond again, and he'll tell you his plan to dig under the wall and get into [[West Ardougne]]. First, you'll need to soften the ground. Use your [[buckets of water]] on the [[Dug hole|mud patch]] behind his house (between the cabbages and potatoes). You can refill the bucket with the sink inside. Then use the [[spade]] on the softened ground.\n[[File:Plague City - Pulling the Grate.png|thumb|220px|Pulling the grate.]]\nYou'll fall under and Edmond will follow you down. Walk south to find a [[pipe (Plague City)|pipe]] blocked by a [[grill (Plague City)|grill]]. After pulling on it to no avail, use a [[rope]] on the pipe, and talk to Edmond to pull the grill off. Put on your gas mask and climb inside to go into West Ardougne.\n\n===Finding Elena===\n{{Needed|Elena's [[Picture]].}}\n{{Map|name=The Rehnison household|2531,3331|r=4|mtype=square|align=left|height=200|width=200|caption=The Rehnison House}}\nOnce inside [[West Ardougne]], talk to [[Jethick]]. He's just to the east (in the same plaza). Show him [[Elena]]'s picture and he'll tell you to go check the Rehnison house and give you a book that he borrowed from them. Go north to the house sitting right up against the edge of the wall, as shown on the map. The grey planks of the building set it apart. They'll let you in when you mention you have the book. Once inside, talk to [[Martha Rehnison]] or [[Ted Rehnison]], then go upstairs and talk to their daughter, [[Milli Rehnison]], who'll tell you more about Elena's disappearance and whereabouts.\nLeave and go south past the town square near the southern wall to find the house with the big black \"X\" on the doors and a stairwell in the middle going down, marked with a black box on the map. Attempt to open the doors; the [[Mourner]]s won't let you in because it's been hit hard by the plague. Tell them that you're looking for a kidnapped girl (you need to select the option to ask again or you cant continue), and they'll tell you you need permission from [[Bravek]] to enter the house.\n\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n===Getting inside===\n{{Needed|A [[bucket of milk]], [[chocolate dust]], and [[snape grass]].}}\n[[File:Plague City - Bravek drinks the hangover cure.png|thumb|right|Bravek drinks the cure.]]\nGo back to the town square and into the large building on the north side, north of the [[manhole (West Ardougne)|manhole]]. Ask the [[clerk]] who is through the door, then tell him ''This is urgent though! Someone's been kidnapped!'', and he'll let you inside to see [[Bravek]]. He can hardly talk to you however, as he's badly hung over. He'll give you [[a scruffy note]] with a recipe for a [[hangover cure]]. To make it, put the [[chocolate dust]] into the [[bucket of milk]], then add [[snape grass]] ('''Do not drink or eat the ingredients'''). Give the hangover cure to him, and tell him that the mourners won't listen to you. He'll then give you a [[warrant]] granting permission to enter the plague house and search for [[Elena]].\nGo to that house, and try to enter again. The [[Mourner]]s will try to stop you, but when given the warrant from Bravek they'll be at a loss, giving you a chance to sneak inside. Once inside, search the [[barrel (Plague City)|barrel]] to the west of the staircase to find [[a small key]]. Elena is downstairs. Go downstairs and unlock the door with the key, talk to her to release her.\n\nReturn to Edmond's garden (where you started) by climbing down the manhole in the middle of the city, and climbing the [[mud pile (Ardougne Sewers)|mud pile]]. Talk to [[Edmond]] to finish the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Plague City\n|image=[[File:Plague City reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp=1\n|rewards=\n* {{SCP|Mining|2,425|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n* [[Ardougne teleport scroll]], reading it unlocks the [[Ardougne Teleport]] with 51 [[Magic]] and use of the [[Ardougne teleport|Ardougne teletab]].}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Plague City is required for the following:\n* [[Biohazard]]\n* [[Ardougne Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n{{Plague City}}"

Begin the quest, and make your way to Sarah in the Falador Farm.\n\nTalk to [[Sarah]], who explains that she was making her monthly delivery to [[The Sheared Ram]] when she was attacked by a hulking monster near the crossroads north of [[Draynor Village]], where she lost her cart of farm produce.\n{{Clear}}\n===The scene of the crime===\n{{Needed|[[Rope]], ''Ned sells these for 18gp in his shop or 15 through dialogue in [[Draynor Village]].''}}\n\n[[File:A Porcine of Interest - investigating cart.png|thumb|250px|The produce cart which Sarah left behind during the attack.]]\nMake your way to the crossroads north of [[Draynor Village]] and investigate the cart there. Then, follow the trail of farming produce and [[broken dead tree]]s north-east until you reach a strange hole next to the [[River Lum]]. Use your rope on the hole and climb down.\n\nUpon entering the cave, walk to the very end of the cave, where you'll find a skeleton. Inspect the skeleton to find that it has been gnawed clean, alongside a scrawled note:\n\n{{Cquote2|This is what I get for exploring uncharted caves.

Clicking the ground during the cutscene will also return you to the beginning.\n\nSpeak to [[Spria]], who tells you that the monster is a [[Sourhog]], a creature made through a magical experiment and whose saliva is extremely acidic. She will give you a pair of [[reinforced goggles]] to protect you from its acid attack, and tells you that its thick hide gives it a resistance to slashing and magical attacks. She will tell you to kill the sourhog and claim Sarah's bounty, and return to her once you do so.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Bringing Home the Bacon===\n{{Needed|[[Reinforced goggles]] and combat equipment.

It is level 37, so lower levelled players should bring some food. As stated by Spria, it is weak to stab and ranged-style weapons. To kill it with [[rings of recoil]], 1 damage must be dealt by the player for kill credit.  This particular Sourhog is immune to poison.\n\nUpon killing the Sourhog, use a knife or slashing weapon to obtain a [[Sourhog foot]], which you'll need as proof to collect Sarah's bounty. If you do not have a knife or slashing weapon, you may use the bronze scimitar that spawns near the skeleton at the end of the cave.\n\n===Finishing up===\n{{Needed|[[Sourhog foot]]}}\nReturn to Sarah, where she'll reward you with 5,000 coins and tell you a strange woman in a hood came to ask her about the job.

The goggles do nothing!''\", a reference to ''{{wp|The Simpsons}}'' episode \"{{wp|Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)|Radioactive Man}}\".\n*If you examine the Sourhog after killing it, the examine text will read \"The pigger they are...\", a reference to the phrase \"The bigger they are, the harder they fall\".\n*If you kill the Sourhog with a [[katana]], your character will say \"Nothing personal, pig.\" after killing it.

Go through the wooden gate north-east of the east exit by the Earth Altar. Then, follow the path to the temple. Click on the temple doors and someone will ask what you want and who you are. Tell them you are sent by King Roald. After some whispering they will ask you to kill a dog. Agree to it.\n\n===The dungeon===\nClimb down the dungeon entrance north of the temple, then kill the level 30 [[temple guardian]]. You cannot use [[Magic]]. The temple guardian can be safe-spotted using an inside corner of the room. Move one square east after coming down the ladder and attack the dog using ranged attacks.

This time, the door swings open. Kill one of the '''level 30''' [[Monk of Zamorak|Monks of Zamorak]] to get a [[golden key]].\n:'''Note:''' These monks can hit hard with their Magic (though they can be [[safespot]]ted using the church pews). It may be wise to use prayers to assist the fight, as there is an altar in the room that can recharge prayer points.\n\nAfter receiving the key, climb up the stairs in the north-east corner of the room. Climb up the ladder of the south west corner of the room to reach the top floor, then talk to [[Drezel]]. Ask him why the river is such a good defence. Next, go back down the trap door into the dungeon. With the golden key in the inventory, the player can unlock the gate in the [[Paterdomus]] dungeon where the [[Temple guardian|guardian]] was located earlier. Proceed through the gate and keep walking until you are in the monument room. In this room, there are seven [[monument]]s and a [[Well (Paterdomus)|well]]. Study the monuments in order to find one holding an [[iron key]], then use the golden key on that monument to swap the two keys. After obtaining the iron key, use your empty [[bucket]] on the nearby well to fill it with [[murky water]].\n\n*'''Note:''' The player can swap any of the golden items with the regular version of that item. If desired, a [[pot]], a [[feather]], a [[candle]], a [[tinderbox]], a [[needle]], and a [[hammer]] is needed, which can then be used on the correct monument holding that item. '''This cannot be done after completing Drezel has moved to the mausoleum.''' The golden items have no functional purpose (for example, the [[Golden tinderbox]] cannot be used to light fires), although they can be converted into coins with [[Low Level Alchemy|Low]] or [[High alchemy]]. Each golden item can only be obtained '''once per account'''.\n[[File:Priest in Peril - Blessing the coffin.png|thumb|250px|The player pours the bucket of blessed water on the coffin, trapping the vampyre within.]]\nReturn to the top floor of the temple, and use the iron key on the cell door. Enter the cell and talk to [[Drezel]] to get him to bless the murky water. Use the [[blessed water]] on the [[Coffin (Priest in Peril)|coffin]] just outside of the cell to seal the vampyre within it. Talk to [[Drezel]] again and he will tell the player to meet him in the dungeon. '''If the player completely exhausts his dialogue, Drezel will move to the mausoleum and the golden items can no longer be obtained.'''\n\nReturn to the dungeon and proceed through the gate located in the north-east corner of the monument room. Speak to [[Drezel]], who will will request 50 '''unnoted''' essence. If you need to, you can give him a mixture of both [[rune essence|rune]] and [[pure essence]]. Players with essence pouches can bring all 50 essence in a single trip if desired.

If you did not bring a bucket or jug of water you can grab the jug of water off of the table in the east room of the palace. Otherwise, take the road north towards [[Lumbridge]]. Cross the north bridge to the forge, and smith a [[bronze bar]] there, or use the Al Kharid forge if you are there.\n\nGo to [[Lumbridge Castle]] and spin all the wool. Take the jug from the kitchen and fill it with water if you didn't get the jug of water from the palace, then take a pot from the kitchen, and a bucket from the basement if you need them. Fill the bucket with water, wet the clay with it, then fill it again.\n\nFollow the road north out of Lumbridge, then go to the [[Fred the Farmer]]'s house. Behind his house there is a garden with 12 [[onion]]s. Pick two onions, then back to the road for the grain field and mill to make the [[pot of flour]]. If you didn't have shears earlier, get them from his house, shear 3 sheep and go back to [[Lumbridge Castle]] to spin the wool.\n\nThe [[rope]] can be bought at [[Ned's Handmade Rope (100% Wool)|Ned's shop]] in [[Draynor Village]].\n\nAt this point, you should now be carrying:\n*3 [[balls of wool]] (from shearing sheep and then spinning it at a spinning wheel)\n*[[Ashes]] (make or find a fire, once it burns out pick up the ashes)\n*A [[bucket of water]] or a jug of water ([[bucket]] bought in any [[general store]], filled at any water source)\n*A [[pot of flour]]\n*A [[bronze bar]] (made by smelting [[Tin ore|tin]] and [[copper ore]])\n*[[Soft clay]] (use [[clay]] with a bucket, [[jug]] or [[bowl of water]])\n*2 [[onion]]s (or 1 [[yellow dye]]) and 15 [[coins]]\n*3 [[beer]]s (normal beer, can be bought at the [[Sheared Ram]] in [[Lumbridge]] or the [[Rusty Anchor Inn]] in [[Port Sarim]])\n*A [[pink skirt]]\n*1 [[redberries]]\n*A [[rope]]\n\n===Starting out===\n'''''Items required:''' 3 [[balls of wool]], [[rope]] (unless buying from [[Ned]]), 2 [[onion]]s '''or''' [[yellow dye]], 1 [[redberries]], [[pot of flour]], [[ashes]], a [[bucket of water]], [[soft clay]], a [[bronze bar]], 3 normal beers, a pink skirt, and 50 [[coins]] (unless teleporting).''\n\nYou begin your quest in the palace of [[Al Kharid]] by talking to [[Chancellor Hassan]]. He will direct you to spymaster [[Osman]], found outside the northern perimeter of the palace. He will tell you to find and speak to his daughter [[Leela]], who can be found strolling east of [[Draynor Village]] just south of the wheat field. Talk to Leela and she will tell you what you need, you must ask about the key and disguise before you can proceed.\n\nIf you look west from where you are standing, you should see the door to [[Ned]]'s house. Ask Ned to make you a wig - get the wig made from the [[balls of wool]]. If you do not already have the rope at this point, you can have Ned make you one for four balls of wool (or you can buy one from him for 15 coins). Once you have the rope and wig, go into the house just west of Ned's, and ask [[Aggie]] (the witch) to make you [[Paste|paste]]. If you do not already have the dye, you can ask her to make it for you, requiring two [[onion]]s and five coins. Dye the wig yellow.\n\nGo in to the jail directly east of Draynor as quickly as possible, avoiding the aggressive level 26 [[jail guard]]s. They will ignore you if your combat level is 53 or higher.\n\nOnce inside the jail building, speak to [[Lady Keli]], telling her she's famous all over [[Gielinor]], then ask her about her latest plan, and that she must have been very skillful. Ask her then if she's sure his people won't try and rescue him. Ask her if you can see the key and then if you can touch the key for a short amount of time. If you've gotten the soft clay with you, you will make an imprint in the clay.\n\nGo to the bank and get the [[bronze bar]] and 20 [[coins]] and return to Osman so he can make the bronze key.\n\n===Saving the Prince===\n'''''Items required:''' 3 [[beer]]s, [[rope]], a [[pink skirt]], a [[wig]] (dyed yellow), and [[paste]].''\n\n[[Talk]] to [[Leela]], who will be happy about the plan and hand you the bronze key. She will then recommend that you talk to the witch for the paste, if you have all the ingredients talk to Leela once again and then head for the jail. Talk to Joe and offer him a drink, (be aware that only normal beer will work and you must have 3 beers in your inventory) until he is drunk. Use the rope on [[Lady Keli]], the key on the cell door, then talk to [[Prince Ali]] and he will use the disguise and escape.\n\nAfter freeing the Prince, return to Lumbridge, and pass through the gate that connects Lumbridge and Al Kharid. '''You can pass through this gate free of charge from now on.''' Go and talk to [[Hassan]] in the Al Kharid palace to claim your reward.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Prince Ali Rescue\n|image = [[File:Prince Ali Rescue reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 3\n|rewards =\n*700 [[coins]]\n*Free passage through the [[Lumbridge]] - [[Al Kharid]] toll gate from now on.\n*(Members) Access to the [[Sorceress's Garden]] [[Thieving]] [[minigame]].\n*(Members) Use of the window shortcut at the rear of [[Al Kharid Palace]] (requires 70 [[Agility]]).\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Prince Ali Rescue is required for the following:\n* [[Contact!]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 27 April 2022\n|update = Beneath Cursed Sands\n|change = Dialogue pertaining to the quest was rewritten to flow better, and potentially offensive dialogue has been removed.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n{{Prince Ali Rescue}}"

He is conducting an investigation on behalf of the [[Kourend Council]] to investigate unusual happenings in [[Port Piscarilius]]. A new gang called the [[Saviours of Kourend]] has recently formed, absorbing many of the other gangs, and has become the largest gang in [[Great Kourend|Kourend]], with more joining them each day. According to him, their leader is The Queen of Thieves. Tomas attempted to infiltrate the gang with little success. Agree to help him.\n\n===Discovery===\n[[File:Robert O'Reilly chathead.png|left]]\nIn the house directly south of the bridge, speak to the [[poor looking woman]] and ask about the Saviours of Kourend's location. She doesn't know where they can be found, but they do know a man who has been working with them: [[Robert O'Reilly]]. He can be found in the building directly west of the bridge, in the room to the right of [[Kenelme]]. In order to reveal the location of the Saviours of Kourend, he will ask for a [[stew]]. \n\n'''If you don't have the stew:'''  \n\nA piece of meat along with a '''raw''' potato can be purchased from [[Kenelme's Wares]] in the house directly to the west, a bowl can be purchased from the [[Leenz's General Supplies|general store]] and filled in the sink in Robert's house, and the stew can be cooked on the [[range]] in Robert's house. Use the potato on the bowl of water, then cook the piece of meat and add it to the bowl followed by cooking the stew. \n\n'''Once you have the Stew:''' \n\nGive him the stew and he will tell you they are located in [[The Warrens]]. The entrance to The Warrens is a [[manhole (Port Piscarilius)|manhole]] located a short walk to the east, marked by the [[File:Dungeon map link icon.png]] [[icon]] on the [[minimap]]. \n\n===Infiltration===\n[[File:Devan Rutter chathead.png|left]]\nAfter climbing down the manhole go a little bit south and head west over the two small bridges (they aren't on the [[minimap]] and may not show up on some web browsers, or on Low Detail mode on some clients) to arrive at the large island. Talk to [[Devan Rutter]]. You will ask to join the gang, but he will want you to kill [[Conrad King]], a senior member of a rival gang, the Vipers, to prove your loyalty.\n[[File:The Queen of Thieves - killing Conrad King.png|thumb|220px|The player kills Conrad King.]]\n'''Note''': Browse the [[Warrens General Store]] to complete an easy task in the [[Kourend & Kebos Diary]].\n\nGo back past the two bridges, then head up where you climbed down the manhole. Walk a bit east until you see Conrad King on the dock on the southern side of the Piscarilius mess hall. You have the option to kill him 'brutally' or 'softly.' Choosing 'softly' results in a humorous dialogue stating that this is impossible, causing you to kill him 'brutally' anyway.\n\n===The truth===\n[[File:Lady Shauna Piscarilius chathead.png|left]]\nReturn to [[Devan Rutter]]. Then, enter the tent north of him and speak to the Queen of Thieves. You will attempt to arrest her, but she tells you the truth about the gang: Before they came along, Kourend was filled with violent gangs who stole and killed, but the Saviours of Kourend pick particular targets, removing people of power and giving it back to those who keep the kingdom alive. She will reveal that she is none other than the leader of Piscarilius, [[Lady Shauna Piscarilius]], and that \"Queen of Thieves\" is her alias which she uses to strike fear into the rich and degenerate.\n[[File:The Queen of Thieves - searching chest.png|thumb|220px|Searching the chest in Councillor Sophia Hughes' home.]]\nYou will doubt her claims, so she tells you about the current leadership situation, and the corruption of the Kourend Council.\n{{Map|name=The Queen of Thieves|x:1670,y:3677|x:1670,y:3684|x:1684,y:3684|x:1684,y:3677|plane=0|mapID=0|mtype=polygon|height=250|width=250|align=left|caption=The location of Councillor Hughes' house.}}\nTo prove she is telling the truth, she will ask you to search [[Councillor Hughes]]' home, as they believe she has ties with the [[Disciple of Yama|Disciples of Yama]].\n\nTravel to [[Kingstown]] and head east to the houses of the Council members. Councillor Hughes' house is immediately north (south of the [[File:Rare trees icon.png]] icon). The evidence Shauna refers to is found upstairs; she is not home, so simply pick the lock and search the chest to find a [[Letter (The Queen of Thieves)|letter]], which proves Shauna's claims.\n\n===Finishing up===\nReturn to [[Tomas Lawry]] and give him the [[Letter (The Queen of Thieves)|letter]]. Reading the contents of the letter, he will forget about the Queen of Thieves, believing Councillor Hughes' ties with the [[Disciple of Yama|Disciples of Yama]] is more pressing, and plans to report it to the Council immediately. However, if you ask him for a reward, he will tell you that the best reward is the satisfaction of a job well done and will tell you to go away as he has more work to do.\n\nReturn to [[Lady Shauna Piscarilius]] down the manhole in \"The Warrens\" by Devan Rutter. She will tell you that [[Councillor Hughes]] has been arrested, and admits that you're not totally useless after all. She continues, saying that her arrest is only the beginning, and there's still much work to be done. Lastly, she will tell you that she may call on your help once more, or maybe not. She will then give you your rewards.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Queen of Thieves\n|image = [[File:The Queen of Thieves reward scroll.png|center]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Thieving|2,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*2,000 [[coins]]\n*A page for [[Kharedst's memoirs]], '[[The fisher's flute]].'

This is likely a reference to players who look up quest guides beforehand.\n*When killing [[Conrad King]], there is a chance he will say the line, \"I'm coming Elizabeth!\", which is a reference to the television comedy ''{{wp|Sanford and Son}}''. In the series, the show's namesake, Fred Sanford, routinely feigns illness and shouts a line similar to that of Conrad King. (It is also possible for Conrad King to merely shout one of several phrases, including \"Here I go!\", \"Not like this!\", or \"Oh, wow!\")\n*The option to kill Conrad King 'brutally' or 'softly' is a reference to the song ''Killing Me Softly With His Song''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Me_Softly_with_His_Song] by Lori Lieberman (later made famous by Roberta Flack).\n*The short story [[Transcript:The Plot And The Potion|The Plot And The Potion]] from the [[Kourend Chronicles]] acts as a sequel to this quest.\n\n{{The Queen of Thieves}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Queen of Thieves, The}}"

The Odd Old Man is a fairly short distance to the east).\n\nReaching him will take you down the same path as travelling [[Canifis]] would. Halfway down that path, you will find the Odd Old Man to the north, just slightly north-west of the [[Silvarea mine|limestone quarry]] (marked by a quest [[icon]] on your [[minimap]], right next to the [[mining site]] icon).\n\nTalk to him, and he will tell you that he needs several bones to complete his collection.

The longer wish-list is 1/4.}} The following is a recommended route for the first six of the eight required bones, starting from the Odd Old Man's house and ending in the [[Lumbridge Swamp Caves]].\n\n#Run west from the Odd Old Man's house and through the gate, then south to the mines south-east of Varrock and kill a [[Giant rat]] near or inside the mine, picking up the [[giant rat bone]] it drops in the process.\n#Head slightly south of the mine to the forest and kill a [[unicorn]] and [[black bear]], picking up the [[unicorn bone]] and the [[bear ribs]] respectively.\n#Head into the sheep pen to the south-west of the mine and west of the forest and kill a [[ram]] to get a [[ram skull]].\n#Walk south towards [[Lumbridge]] (or teleport to the city and walk east) and kill a [[goblin]] on the eastern side of the [[River Lum]] to get a [[goblin skull]].\n#Make sure you have a [[light source]] (a lantern is '''highly''' preferred, as explosions are possible in the caves with a [[candle]]) and a rope (if you've never been to the [[Lumbridge Swamp Caves]] before). Head south through the [[Lumbridge Graveyard]] and then south-west to the swamp caves (indicated by a dungeon icon on the map, south of the candle shop) (or, instead, if you have started or completed [[The Lost Tribe]], travel through the [[Lumbridge Castle]] cellar and head immediately south through the hole in the wall). From there, go down to the cave (using a rope if necessary). Go west and then south to find [[big frog]]s (the [[frog]]s in the Lumbridge Swamp '''will not''' drop the bone - they are a different type of frog; also ensure you kill a [[Big frog|'''Big Frog''']] in the caves, as the others '''will not''' drop the bone). Kill one and pick up the [[big frog leg]].\n\nFrom here, head to [[Draynor Village]], north-west of the Lumbridge Swamps. Find and '''talk to''' [[Fortunato]] in the market about vinegar. Only after talking about vinegar will he have it stocked in the store, trade him and purchase 8 (or 35 if intending to do [[Rag and Bone Man II]] at some point, saving time later) [[jugs of vinegar]]. '''Do not steal from the market stall or he won't talk to you.'''\n\nThis is also a good opportunity to withdraw items to return to the Odd Old Man ([[Varrock Teleport|Varrock teleportation runes]] or [[Magic tablet|tablet]], [[Digsite pendant]]), and, if returning directly to him, all 6 currently collected bones and the necessary supplies to polish all 8 (8 jugs of vinegar, 8 pots (highly recommended to make the 6 bone in vinegar you currently can and 2 pots of vinegar to save space - see \"Polishing the bones\" for details), and 8 [[logs]] (of any type - alternatively, an [[axe]] to cut down the trees by the Odd Old Man, which will save a lot of space)).\n\n'''Note:''' Be careful that you '''do not''' accidentally \"empty\" a bone in vinegar, because if you do, '''you will lose the bone and have to collect that bone again'''.\n\nFrom here, travel south-west to Port Sarim and take the ship (the third transportation icon from the north, fourth from the south) (requires 30 gp each way) to Karamja (can also teleport (amulet of glory)). Once there:\n\n#Walk west towards the [[Karamja Volcano]] and kill a monkey on the way, picking up the [[monkey paw]].\n#Head into the [[Crandor and Karamja Dungeon]], which is located at the top of the Karamja Volcano (marked by a dungeon icon), and kill a [[giant bat]], picking up the [[giant bat wing]].\n\nAfter you've gathered all 8 bones, head back to the Odd Old Man, and a bank if necessary.\n\n===Polishing the bones===\n{{Inventory|align=right\n|Bone in vinegar |Bone in vinegar |Bone in vinegar |Bone in vinegar\n|Bone in vinegar |Bone in vinegar |Bone in vinegar |Bone in vinegar\n|Logs |Logs |Logs |Logs\n|Logs |Logs |Logs |Logs\n|Tinderbox |Varrock teleport (tablet)\n}}\n'''''Items required:''' 8 [[bone in vinegar]] (requiring 8 [[Jug of vinegar|jugs of vinegar]], 8 [[pot]]s, and all 8 bones to make), a [[tinderbox]], 8 [[logs]] (of any type - can also bring an [[axe]] to chop them down by the [[Odd Old Man]]''.)\n\n'''''Recommended:''' A teleportation method to the [[Odd Old Man]] ([[Varrock]] teleport, [[Digsite pendant]]).''\n\nAn example of how an inventory looks, before heading back to the Odd Old Man, can be seen on the right.\n\nIf you haven't already, make 8 [[Pot of vinegar|pots of vinegar]] by using the [[Jug of vinegar|jugs of vinegar]] on your pots and then use all the bones on the pots of vinegar to make 8 [[bone in vinegar]].\n\n'''Note:''' Be careful that you '''do not''' accidentally \"empty\" a bone in vinegar, because if you do, '''you will lose the bone and have to collect that bone again'''.\n\nGo back to the old man taking the eight bones in vinegar, a [[tinderbox]] and eight [[logs]] (or, alternatively, bring an [[axe]] instead of logs; there are [[tree]]s near the Odd Old Man at the bottom of the stairs where logs can be cut). '''Any''' type of logs works for this quest, provided you have the [[Firemaking]] level to light the logs.\n\nTo polish the bones, use a log on the pot-boiler next to the Odd Old Man. Then, use a bone in vinegar on the pot boiler, and finally, use your tinderbox to light it (you will not receive [[experience]] for lighting the logs). It takes 12 seconds for each pot to boil. You can hop worlds after lighting the logs to skip these 12 seconds. Repeat this for all eight bones.\n\nTalk to the [[Odd Old Man]], and give him the polished bones to complete the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Rag and Bone Man I\n|image = [[File:Rag and Bone Man I reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n* {{SCP|Cooking|500}} [[Cooking]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Prayer|500}} [[Prayer]] experience\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Rag and Bone Man I is required for the following:\n*[[Rag and Bone Man II]] - Rag and Bone Man II starts immediately after completing Rag and Bone Man I.

Historically, the phrase referred to an individual who would travel the streets of a city with a horsedrawn cart, and would collect old rags (for converting into fabric and paper), bones for making glue, scrap iron and other items, often trading them for other items of limited value.\n*The bones scattered in and around the [[Odd Old Man|Odd Old Man's]] house have many interesting \"examine\" texts (a good activity to partake in while waiting for the bones to be polished). One such skeleton states \"What a waste of prayer xp!\" Examining the pot-boiler at the various stages of boiling the bones will also give interesting texts, the one while the bone is boiling being: \"This smells so very, very bad...\"\n*Previously in the game, the special bones were common drops, rather than guaranteed drops.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Rag and Bone Man I}}"

If not, start in reverse order from fairy ring {{Fairycode|CKS}} or walking east from the Odd Old Man's location. Another way to reach [[Morytania]] is using [[Kharyrll Teleport]] from [[Ancient Magicks]] or [[POH]] portal. The [[undead cow]]s are just west of the [[Ectofuntus]], within the farm. Then, travel west and go under [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]] by pushing the easternmost memorial in the graveyard south-east of the castle to find the [[experiment]]s underneath (see the [[Creature of Fenkenstrain]] quest guide). Travel south-west to [[Canifis]] where many level 88 [[werewolves]] are located. They can be safespotted in the bar with a Ranged or Magic weapon. If you otherwise don't want to attack a level 88 werewolf, you can attack one of the level 24's in [[Canifis]] with [[Wolfbane]], and when they are almost dead, switch to another weapon. They will change into a werewolf with low life points and may drop the bones. Finally, travel south-west towards the [[Paterdomus Temple]] entrance to find [[ghoul]]s.\n:It is also a good idea to buy a [[mirror shield]], some [[ice cooler]]s, several [[fishing explosive]]s, and (optionally) a [[spiny helmet]] from the [[Slayer Master]] in Canifis while you are here.\n:*[[Undead cow]] - drops [[undead cow ribs]]\n:*[[Experiment]]/[[Experiment No. 2]] ([[Taverley]], after [[Grim Tales]]) - drops [[experiment bone]]\n:*[[Werewolf]] - drops [[werewolf bone]]\n:*[[Ghoul]] - drops [[ghoul bone]]\n\n===Misthalin===\n:'''''Items required:''' [[Slash weapon]] (for the sewer webs).''\n:'''''Recommended:''' Teleportation method to [[Varrock]] or [[Edgeville]].''\n:'''Travel method:''' All of the monsters in this section can be found in the [[Varrock Sewers]], which can be entered in either [[Varrock]] (just south-east of the eastern entrance of [[Varrock Palace]]) or directly south of [[Edgeville]].

Alternatively, walk south and squeeze through the other hole. Go south towards the area full of [[rockslug]]s; then, head east towards the goblins, found at the far east of the [[Lumbridge Swamp Caves]]. You could also (especially if The Lost Tribe has not been started or completed yet) enter the Lumbridge Swamp Caves via the entrance in the [[Lumbridge Swamp]] and walk to the far eastern part of the caves.

There are [[jackal]]s on the way to the level 42 [[lizard]]s (if travelling north from Nardah or the fairy ring). You need to use [[ice cooler]]s on the lizards when their health is depleted for the kill. After these, walk south-west to find [[vulture]]s (located just north-west of the [[Agility Pyramid]]). If the vultures fly, you will need to use [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] attacks.

[[Baby blue dragon]]s are found in the [[Taverley Dungeon]], past the [[scorpion]]s, [[chaos dwarves]] and [[lesser demon]]s, through the gate that requires the dusty key to open. You could also, with level 70 [[Agility]], use the pipe near the entrance to the dungeon.

Pay a visit to the [[Lighthouse]] ([[Fairy rings|fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|ALP}}), north of the [[Barbarian Outpost]]. [[Dagannoth]]s are found within the basement (requires completion of [[Horror from the Deep]] to access). Good [[food]] and [[armour]] is suggested, as these dagannoths are aggressive, and the area is a [[multi-combat zone]].\n:Next, grab a [[rope]] (and [[Glarial's amulet]] if [[Waterfall Quest]] is only partially completed), and then use your games necklace to teleport back to the Barbarian Outpost. Travel south towards [[Baxtorian Falls]], board the log raft to the west of the house north of the falls, use your rope on the rock after the raft crashes, then use it on the dead tree and enter the [[Waterfall Dungeon]].

There, you will find a plethora of [[ogre]]s and [[wolves]]. If walking from Castle Wars, killing a zogre at [[Jiggig]] first may be preferable (continue reading to see how). From Feldip Hills, travel north-west (east if using fairy ring (code: {{Fairycode|BKP}})) to [[Jiggig]] (south of [[Castle Wars]]) to find [[zogre]]s.\n:Zogres are located within the Jiggig tomb, and may inflict [[disease]] upon the player. The [[inoculation bracelet]] will counter this effect; just be sure to keep it equipped all the time. Or, if you have completed [[Zogre Flesh Eaters]], you may buy [[Relicym's balm]] (requires all 3 dosages to fully cure disease; taking one or two doses will lessen the effects) from [[Uglug Nar]] (if you opened his shop after completing the quest). Alternatively, you can bring [[Sanfew serum]] for a heightened effect. Another option to counter the disease is to go to [[Clan Wars]] and use the [[pool of refreshment]], which will reset your stats to full. The zogres also have an incredible 80% immunity to most weaponry; therefore, it is advisable to bring along an [[ogre bow]] and [[ogre arrow]]s, an [[ogre composite bow]] and [[brutal arrow]]s, or enough necessary runes to cast several [[Crumble Undead]] spells.\n:There is an alternative method to the above that does not require you to have started the Zogre Flesh Eaters quest at all and is much safer, though it takes a little more patience. Bring runes for Crumble Undead and Telekinetic Grab to the entrance of Jiggig. Standing next to the barricades, you can attack the Zogres moving around near the campfire. They will back off out of range as they cannot reach you to retaliate. Wait for them to move back into range and continue attacking. Once one of the Zogres gets very low on health, wait until it is relatively close by (and not actively backing away from you) so that your final attack to kill it ensures that its loot pile is within telegrab range. With some patience and learning how the Zogres move in this area, you will be able to obtain the bone without having to actually set foot in Jiggig.\n:*[[Wolf]] - drops [[wolf bone]]\n:*[[Ogre]] - drops [[ogre ribs]]\n:*[[Zogre]] - drops [[zogre bone]]\n\n== Polishing the bones ==\n:'''''Items required:''' 27 [[pot]]s, 27 [[Jug of vinegar|jugs of vinegar]] (and 27 coins to buy them), 27 [[logs]] (of any type; alternatively, an [[axe]] to chop them down by the [[Odd Old Man]]), a [[tinderbox]] (a [[Bruma torch|Bruma Torch]] does NOT work), all 27 bones (as few as one at a time can be polished and brought to the Odd Old Man).''\n:'''''Recommended:''' Teleportation methods to [[Draynor Village]] and to the [[Odd Old Man]].''\n:Once you have collected the bones, go to [[Draynor Village]] and talk to (or simply trade with) [[Fortunato]] (found in the market square) there. He will be able to sell you some [[jugs of vinegar]] for 1 coin each. Buy 27 of them. '''Do not steal from the market stall or he will not talk to you for a while.''' In addition to the vinegar, collect 27 [[pot]]s, 27 [[logs]] (of any type - not necessary, though. You can, alternatively, bring an [[axe]] with you when you visit the [[Odd Old Man]] and cut down trees in the area instead) and a [[tinderbox]] and talk to the Odd Old Man for further instructions.  \n\n''Tip:'' To cut down on trips, lower your hitpoints to 1 using a [[dwarven rock cake]] or [[locator orb]], then bring a tinder box and 27 logs to the Odd Old Man and let the bats nearby kill you. Then, bring your [[bone in vinegar|bones in vinegar]] to the Odd Old Man and withdraw your tinderbox and a log from your gravestone. Continue to withdraw logs as needed. This allows you to polish all the bones in 2 trips. \n\nUsing an equipped log basket can allow for all bones to be done in 1 trip.\n\n:#Use a jug of vinegar with a [[pot]] to get a [[pot of vinegar]].\n:#Use the bone with the pot of vinegar to get a [[bone in vinegar]].\n:#*'''Note:''' Be careful that you '''do not''' accidentally \"empty\" a bone in vinegar, because if you do, '''you will lose the bone and have to collect that bone again'''.\n:#Polish the bone.

Historically, the phrase referred to an individual who would travel the streets of a city with a horsedrawn cart, and would collect old rags (for converting into fabric and paper), bones for making glue, scrap iron and other items, often trading them for other items of limited value.\n*The bones scattered in and around the [[Odd Old Man]]'s house have many interesting \"examine\" texts (a good activity to partake in while waiting for the bones to be polished). One such skeleton states \"What a waste of prayer xp!\" Examining the pot-boiler at the various stages of boiling the bones will also give interesting texts, the one while the bone is boiling being \"This smells so very, very bad...\"\n*After completing the quest, the Wish-List on his house will have \"Non-chafing Manacles\" written on it.\n*Rag and Bone Man II was formerly the [[miniquest]] named \"Rag & Bone Wish List\"; it is ''not'' the same as ''RuneScape''{{'}}s sequel quest {{RSL|Fur 'n Seek}}. As, unlike all other miniquests, the wish list awarded one quest point, it was renamed ''Rag and Bone Man II'' and reclassified as a quest in {{UD|Runes and Ammunition & Log In Screen Competition!|an update}} on [[17 August]] [[2017]].\n*Previously in the game, a player needed to choose between the [[bonesack]] and [[ram skull helm]] as a reward for having completed the quest, but could swap one for the other at any time by talking to the [[Odd Old Man]] again. This was later changed at {{UD|Poll 71 and Darkmeyer Updates|an update}}, allowing players to possess both at the same time.\n<gallery>\nRag and Bone Man II reward scroll (Ram skull helm).png|The quest completion scroll before {{UD|Poll 71 and Darkmeyer Updates|an update}} when selecting the [[ram skull helm]].\nRag and Bone Man II reward scroll (Bonesack).png|The quest completion scroll before {{UD|Poll 71 and Darkmeyer Updates|an update}} when selecting the [[bonesack]].\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Rag and Bone Man II}}"

The success rate of catching rats seems to take into account the proximity of the rat, so if you're using a kitten it may be worth attacking one to turn it aggressive to you, which in turn will keep it close. This trick will not work for rats later in the quest.\n\nCatch eight rats in Varrock Sewers by clicking the \"Chase\" option on your cat.

He needs a house cleared of rats in an unofficial capacity so as not to tarnish his client's reputation; to this end, you will need to sneak around the house unnoticed, avoiding the guards who will think you are an intruder. Jimmy will give you [[Directions]] to follow to the house. Read them, and you will be prompted to go to the house (it is not located on the [[world map]] — you are teleported there instantly). You will find yourself in front of the house, in the gardens.\n\nTo make your way inside the house, you will need to make sure you don't draw the guards' attention; keeping [[Run]] on is advised and having lots of patience will help greatly. Guards will not notice your cat. There are three \"checkpoints\"; upon reaching these points, any guards who see you will send you back to these points, rather than the very beginning.\n\n====Part 1====\n[[File:Ratcatchers Mansion(Outside, S).png|600px]]\n\n''The red and blue tiles indicate where the guards stop along their paths.

For example, the south guard goes along the path (1-2-3-2-1).''\n* Start at tile '''A'''.\n* When the south guard is on '''blue tile 1''', run to tile '''B'''.\n* Immediately run to tile '''C'''.\n\n====Part 2====\n[[File:Ratcatchers Mansion(Outside, N).png|600px]]\n\n''Note that when the north guard would normally move from their position at tile 7, they will instead teleport to tile 5.''\n* Start at tile '''A'''.\n* When the south guard is at '''blue tile 1''' and the north guard is on any '''red tile 1-4''', run to tile '''B'''.\n* When the north guard is on any '''red tile 4-7''', run to tile '''C'''.\n* While the north guard is still on any '''red tile 4-7''', run to tile '''D''' and climb the trellis, then immediately move to tile '''A''' in '''Part 3''' below, if not caught.\n*Climbing the trellis will set a safe checkpoint north of the trellis.\n\n====Part 3====\n''For this section, it's recommended to go into your [[Settings]], then \"All Settings\" and enable the option \"Hide Roofs\" under the Display category. This will make it a lot easier to see the guards as they move around while you attempt to move inside the mansion.''\n\n'''Note:''' If the guards follow a pattern that will never allow passage, you are required to either switch worlds or get caught by the same guard several times.\n\nFor this section, it is recommended to keep your cat in your inventory while moving about to avoid it becoming stuck on obstacles, or else use the 'Call follower' option in the equipment tab to teleport your cat to you.\n\n[[File:Ratcatchers Mansion(Inside).png|600px]]\n\n* Starting from tile '''A''', when the west guard is on any '''blue tile 6-7''' and the east guard is on any '''red tile 4-7''', run to tile '''B''' and go through the door.\n* Catch the rat in this room. Make sure you are not standing in the doorway when the guard passes by.\n* When the west guard is on any '''blue tile 6-7''' and the east guard is on any '''red tile 5-7''', run to tile '''A'''. \n* When the west guard is on any '''blue tile 4-7''' and the east guard is on any '''red tile 6-7''', run to tile '''C''' and go through the door, again making sure you are not standing in the doorway when the guard passes by.\n** Alternatively for steps 3-4, get caught and start at the tile that mirrors A, then mirror previous steps.\n* When the west guard is on any '''blue tile 1 or 3-6''' and the east guard is on '''red tile 1''', run to tile '''D'''.\n* Catch the 2 rats in this room and go down the ladder. There will be no more guards once you go down the ladder.\n* Catch the last 3 rats in this room and the kitchen to the north.\n*1 rat may spawn outside of this room/kitchen, simply change world and the rat will be correctly spawn in the room. \n\nTo proceed, all six rats need to have been caught. You will automatically start a dialogue with your cat after catching the last rat.\n\nOnce you catch all six rats, teleport out of the mansion and return to Jimmy Dazzler. Alternatively, you can return to Ardougne by sneaking back to the trellis. He will give you access to the [[Ardougne Rat Pits]] and tell you about the next person you have to find: [[Hooknosed Jack]].\n\n===Hooknosed Jack===\n{{Needed|A [[cat]] with decent [[Cat#Combat_stats|combat stats]], four pieces of [[cheese]], [[rat poison]] or the ingredients for it (a [[vial]], [[red spiders' eggs]], and a [[kwuarm]]), a [[bucket of milk]], a [[marrentill]] and [[unicorn horn dust]].|recommended=If you have one, an [[overgrown cat]] can be an advantage due to its 10 HP and 5 strength. Also, the [[catspeak amulet]]'' ''and [[fish]] to heal your cat (about 6 will suffice -- leaping trout/salmon does not work) [[raw karambwanji]] may be used as an alternative food source for healing your [[cat]] as well stacks nicely freeing inventory space.}}\n\nYou can find [[Hooknosed Jack]] in south-eastern [[Varrock]] (look for the minigame icon). He will tell you about the rat infestation in a warehouse nearby. You need rat poison, or he can make you some if you give him a vial, red spiders' eggs, and a kwuarm. Use the poison on four pieces of cheese to create [[poisoned cheese]]; then, go to the warehouse south of the pub. Go in and climb the ladder to the top. Use your poisoned cheese on the four rat holes to poison them. Return to Hooknosed Jack.\n\n[[File:Ratbattle.png|thumb|right|Fighting the King rat.]]\nHe will tell you that his cat, Pox, ate some of the poisoned rats. Go to the [[Apothecary]] (the potion shop in west Varrock). He will ask for a marrentill herb, a crushed unicorn horn, and a bucket of milk to make a special [[cat antipoison]]. Give the antipoison to Hooknosed Jack to cure Pox, who will then tell you that there is still one rat left - the biggest and most evil. Go back to the warehouse. Climb upstairs and inside a room, you'll see the [[King rat]], but you won't be able to reach it yourself. If your cat disappears log out and back in.\n\n\nEnsure that you have enough fish (8-10 recommended). Use your cat on the hole in the wall (not the rat holes) to challenge the king rat. You will be presented with two dialogue options:\n*\"Be careful!\" : Your cat will automatically retreat if it has only one hitpoint remaining, allowing you to restart the fight. (The King rat will regain its hp.)\n*\"Don't hold back!\" : Your cat will continue fighting until it or the rat dies. '''''{{Colour|red|Warning}}:''' Not recommended due to the potential risk of losing your cat.''\n''You can always withdraw and pull back your cat by climbing down the stairs, or by calling it via the [[Worn Equipment|worn equipment]] tab.''\n\n\nThe king rat has 10 hitpoints and deals a maximum of 1 damage at a time. Your cat has [[Cat#combat stats|combat stats]] according to its type. Whenever your cat takes too much damage, you can use fish on the hole in the wall ('''''not on the cat itself''''') to heal it. \n\nAfter you defeat the King rat, go back to Hooknosed Jack. He'll give you access to the Varrock Rat Pits and tell you about [[Smokin' Joe]].\n\n===Smokin' Joe===\n{{Needed|A [[cat]], a [[catspeak amulet]], a [[pot of weeds]] and a [[tinderbox]].}}\n[[File:Ratcatchers Keldagrim smoking.png|thumb|The rats are smoked out of their hole and ambushed by the cat.]]\nGo to [[Keldagrim]] (you can use the minecart entrance north-west of the [[Grand Exchange]], the [[Blast Furnace]] [[minigame teleport]], or the city's entrance east of [[Rellekka]]) and talk to [[Smokin' Joe]] east of the [[Pickaxe-Is-Mine|pickaxe shop]] (far in the east of Keldagrim). If you have not started the Giant dwarf, you must start this quest in order to access the city. He will tell you about his rat problem. The only way to get the rats out of their hole is to smoke them out, but Smokin' Joe can't do it because of the poor condition of his lungs. Offer to help him. Light a pot of weeds with your tinderbox, and use it on the rat hole to the east of him. Rats will come out the other side and quickly go back in. Place your cat on the ground and wear your catspeak amulet, then use your [[smouldering pot]] on the rat hole again, and your cat will offer to help. Accept, and your cat will ambush the rats and kill them. Talk to Smokin' Joe again, and he will give you access to the Keldagrim Rat Pits and tell you about [[The Face]].\n\n:'''Note:''' If your cat disappears when you use the smouldering pot on the rat hole, simply log out and back in again, or use the [[Call follower]] button, and it will reappear next to you.\n\n===The Face and Felkrash===\n{{Needed|A [[catspeak amulet]], a [[snake charm]] (comes with the [[music scroll]] that you buy or from [[The Feud]]) and 101 [[coins]] (or 51 with a [[ring of charos]] (a)).|recommended=Fast travel to [[Port Sarim]] and [[Pollnivneach]].}}\n[[File:Ratcatchers Charm Music.png|thumb|The music sheet to charm the rats.]]\n[[File:Ratcatchers Port Sarim charming.png|thumb|Charming the rats in Port Sarim.]]\n\n:'''{{Colour|red|Warning}}:''' Ali (or Badir) will ask for all coins that you have with you, unless you have the ring of charos (a) equipped.\n\nYou can find [[The Face]] in Port Sarim next to the [[Gerrant's Fishy Business|fishing shop]] (look for the minigame icon). She will tell you to talk to [[Felkrash]] down in the rat pits. Go down the [[manhole (Rat Pits)|manhole]] and find Felkrash, who will tell you to get rid of all of Port Sarim's vermin at once.\n\nTalk to The Face and ask the third option she will tell you about a [[snake charmer]] in [[Pollnivneach]].\n\n'''Note:''' You have to talk with The Face before heading to Pollnivneach, else the snake charmer will not discuss the alternate methods of animal charming.\n\nGo to Pollnivneach in the [[Kharidian Desert]]. You will find Ali (or Badir) the Snake Charmer there south of the bar. Use a coin on his money pot to get his attention. Ask him about charming other animals, and he will tell you that he and Felkrash had a falling out because of Felkrash's killing of animals. When presented with multiple-choice dialogue, ''offer him some money''. Tell him you ''don't care about his offer'' and ''walk away slowly'' until you get the option to ''stop''. He will reluctantly give you a [[music scroll]] and [[snake charm]] for 100 coins (if you already have a snake charm from [[The Feud]] quest in your inventory or bank, you will not receive another). You can charm him with the ring of charos to lower his price to 50 coins, and also skip the walking away part.\n\nReturn to Port Sarim and stand near the docks. Compose the tune on the snake charm in the order that you can find on your music scroll (as seen in the screenshot; D, G, E, F#, (raise octave D), B, C#, A). One note is selected per page, note that the fifth note is an octave higher, which requires pressing the ''Raise an Octave'' button on the top left of the scroll. Once you're done, click \"PLAY\". Note: You cannot play the tune unless you have gotten the music scroll from Ali (or Badir) the Snake Charmer. If you try, you'll get a message that your fingers are not dexterous enough to play the tune.\n\nYour character will proceed to play the song, which will charm the rats. You'll see a cutscene where you lead the rats into the ocean. Talk to Felkrash in the Port Sarim Rat Pits to finish the quest.\n\n{{Bug|Talking to Felkrash with an overgrown cat in the inventory will cause her to train it into a wily cat, which will automatically be set as your follower.

Exterminate!\", which is a reference to the {{wp|Daleks}} in the British science-fiction show ''{{wp|Doctor Who}}''.\n*Sometimes a guard will say \"I miss Billy and Bob *sigh*\". This is a reference to the guards killed during the cutscene of the [[Garden of Tranquillity]] quest, where you were stealing the statue of [[Saradomin]]. It doesn't matter if you have started the quest or not.\n*The cutscene in Port Sarim in which the rats are lured away with the help of the flute, is a reference to the German legend of the {{Wp|Pied Piper of Hamelin}}.\n*Felkrash states that seagulls are \"too flighty\" to be central characters, this is likely a reference to the book ''{{wp|Jonathan Livingston Seagull}}'', where the main character is a seagull learning new ways to fly.\n*If the player has completed [[Dragon Slayer II]] and unlocked the ability to talk to cats without a catspeak amulet, the quest will allow you to help Smokin' Joe without the amulet.\n*Ratcatchers is generally considered to be one of <i>Old School</i>'s weakest quests by both the community and the development team. Commonly criticised aspects include the writing and the frustrating mechanics of the mansion maze and cat fight.<ref>https://youtu.be/drZDtFYG-7Q?t=792</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22jsXGqNiY</ref>\n*The Snake Charmer in Pollnivneach initially wants however many coins you have plus one, which is why the player's character can never have enough money for the music scroll when talking to him for the first time.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Ratcatchers}}"

He tells the player that a hundred years ago, a very important meeting was held in Lumbridge. Supposedly his ancestor, [[Franizzard Van Lumbcook]], cooked such an amazing banquet for the occasion that he was offered a job as head cook, along with all his descendants, for life.\n\nThis big, important meeting is held in Lumbridge every ten years and today is the 10th meeting. As he cannot think of a brilliant dish himself, he intends to use his ancestor's recipe for the feast. However, he needs help gathering the ingredients, again. Gather the ingredients and complete the subquest to receive an invitation to The Feast. All but the [[rotten tomato]] can be obtained from the Grand Exchange. You can buy one from [[Pelters' Veg Stall]] behind the [[Varrock General Store]], or head to the bank chest at the Emir's Arena in [[Al Kharid]] to obtain one from the barrel.\n\nItems required: [[eye of newt]], [[Greenman's ale|glass of greenman's ale]], [[rotten tomato]] and [[Dirty blast|dirty blast ( fruit blast + ashes )]].\n\n===The Feast===\n{{Listen\n|title = The Secret Council\n|align = right\n|filename = The Secret Council.ogg\n|desc = The music that plays during the long cutscene.}}\nEnter the doors to the dining room to begin the feast. The members of the [[Lumbridge]] council are gathered at the table:\n\n*a [[Mountain Dwarf]] from [[White Wolf Mountain]]\n*[[Osman]] or [[Selim]] from [[Al Kharid]]\n*the goblin generals from [[Goblin Village]]\n*[[Pirate Pete]] from [[Braindeath Island]]\n*the [[Lumbridge Guide]]\n*[[Evil Dave]] from [[Edgeville]]\n*[[Skrach Uglogwee]] from the [[Feldip Hills]]\n*[[Sir Amik Varze]] from [[Falador]]\n*[[Awowogei]] from [[Ape Atoll]]\n*[[Duke Horacio]] himself\n*[[Aris]] from [[Varrock]], who is arriving late.\n\nRight before you enter, the Duke will get the [[strange box]] event and will leave the room to fiddle with it, and Osman will get taken away by [[Evil Bob]]. At this point, you will enter the room. A short while later, the [[Culinaromancer]] crashes the party and starts to attack everyone at the dining table with [[magic]] spells. Luckily, Aris will show up and freeze everyone in time (except the player and herself).\n<gallery>\nThe Culinaromancer's return.png|The [[Culinaromancer]] arrives.\nGypsy's Arrival.png|[[Aris]] arrives too late.\nTempus Cessit.png|Aris casts \"Tempus Cessit\" to freeze the room in time.\n</gallery>\n\n===Freeing council members===\n[[Aris]] explains that the [[Culinaromancer]] was a cook in Lumbridge a hundred years ago and had threatened the secret council with death, only to be thwarted by the Duke's assistant, who managed to trap him in another dimension. This assistant was the cook's ancestor, and was made head cook for life.\n\nThe current head cook, whom you helped build the feast, apparently created a powerful food-magic, which released the Culinaromancer from his prison. Seeing him, Aris casts the aforementioned spell, so that you both can protect the council from the Culinaromancer's attacks. While she can easily seal the Culinaromancer in a heartbeat, due to the fact you caused the Culinaromancer to awaken she holds you responsible and sends you to save them as the magic is causing a temporal paradox that could destroy the known reality with the magic.\n\nAfter the feast, you will be able to enter and exit the dining hall at will. However, the room will be in a dormant state. To release each member of the council from the Culinaromancer's spell, you must feed each of them their favourite food. Aris and Cook will both be there to help you. You can complete these subquests in any order, and start as many of them at a time as you want.\n\nAfter you give each member their favourite dish, Aris teleports them away to safety and tells you how many more council members are left.

Aris then says that you too must go through the portal to finish him off.\n\nWhen you're in the strange dimension, you'll find the Culinaromancer, a few white portals that lead back to [[Lumbridge]], and one of your previous quest bosses. The Culinaromancer is too strong to be defeated until you've defeated the first five bosses. Prayer cannot be used in this dimension.\n\n'''Note:''' You can leave and stock up after defeating each boss without losing your place in the fight.\n====Agrith-Na-Na====\n[[Agrith-Na-Na]] is [[Agrith Naar]] from the [[Shadow of the Storm]] quest, but he is now made of bananas and is level 146. He uses [[melee]] up close and [[Fire Blast]] at a distance. Kill him however you like, with food. \n\n====Flambeed====\n[[Flambeed]] is [[Fareed]] from [[Desert Treasure I]]. He's level 149 now. You need [[ice gloves]] to wield a weapon. If you attack him without ice gloves, your weapon will return to your inventory. He's harder to defeat without [[prayer]], but you should be able to kill him with plenty of high healing food. You can [[snare]] him, run away, and then mage him so you only use little to no food. He drops [[cake]]s.\n\n====Karamel====\n[[Karamel]] is [[Kamil]] from the [[Desert Treasure I]] quest. Fight her up close with a [[Fire spell]] that has a lower level requirement than your actual Magic level. You should not be using your highest level fire spell, as Karamel will likely lower your magic level to the point that you are no longer able to cast it. Bring [[stat restore potion]]s and lots of food. Even with lowering your stats, Karamel is incredibly inaccurate. A good strategy is to use [[Fire Bolt]] with [[Chaos gauntlets]]. As usual, [[Melee]] doesn't work on her very well. Unlike Kamil, Karamel uses ranged attacks at melee range. Since her ranged attacks are not very strong, a good tactic is to stand right next to her so she uses ranged, which reduces how frequently she uses her ice attacks. Manually casting spells is beneficial due to her freezing effects stopping your auto-attacks. She drops a [[choc-ice]].\n\nNote: Even though Kamil is immune to [[Iban Blast]], Karamel is not. Iban Blast can be used very effectively.\n\n====Dessourt====\n[[Dessourt]] is [[Dessous]] from [[Desert Treasure I]]. [[Melee]] doesn't work very well on him, however he is less resistant to [[stab weapons]]. [[Magic]] such as [[Iban Blast]] works well. [[Ranged]] also works really well on him. Bring lots of food, and then, defeat him as quickly as possible. He drops [[chocolate dust]].\n\n====Gelatinnoth Mother====\n[[Gelatinnoth Mother]] is the [[Dagannoth Mother]] from the [[Horror from the Deep]] quest, with that in mind you will need to bring Water, Air, Earth and Fire runes in order to attack her during her weakness. She uses a ranged attack that rolls two hits per attack, one magic based and one ranged based. Each hit is capable of hitting for 20 for a possible max hit of 40 per attack. Players who have 80 or less health can die easily with a bit of bad luck and slow eating. The fight itself is fairly easy, although a bit long. She changes colour depending on her weakness. She has a low [[Magic]] [[Defence]] but high Melee Defence, making it best to not bother with Melee and just focus on maging and ranging. A great strategy is to mage her while wearing a mix of the best [[dragonhide armour]] available, a shield such as a [[dragonfire shield]], [[granite shield]] or [[toktz-ket-xil]], and melee helmet such as [[Barrows equipment|Barrows]]. Otherwise, she will rip through [[Mystic robes]] and other magic robes with her ranged attacks. This would give the player a balanced Defence against both Ranged and Magic Defence without sacrificing too much Magic attack bonus.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Image\n!Colour\n!Weakness\n!Attack Using\n|-\n|[[File:Gelatinnoth Mother (air).png|frameless|100x100px]]\n|White\n|[[Air spells]]\n|[[Wind Strike]], [[Wind Bolt|Bolt]], [[Wind Blast|Blast]], [[Wind Wave|Wave]], or [[Wind Surge|Surge]].\n|-\n|[[File:Gelatinnoth Mother (water).png|frameless|100x100px]]\n|Blue\n|[[Water spells]]\n|[[Water Strike]], [[Water Bolt|Bolt]], [[Water Blast|Blast]], [[Water Wave|Wave]], or [[Water Surge|Surge]].\n|-\n|[[File:Gelatinnoth Mother (melee).png|frameless|100x100px]]\n|Orange\n|[[Melee]]\n|[[Melee]] attacks.\n|-\n|[[File:Gelatinnoth Mother (earth).png|frameless|100x100px]]\n|Brown\n|[[Earth spells]]\n|[[Earth Strike]], [[Earth Bolt|Bolt]], [[Earth Blast|Blast]], [[Earth Wave|Wave]], or [[Earth Surge|Surge]].\n|-\n|[[File:Gelatinnoth Mother (fire).png|frameless|100x100px]]\n|Red\n|[[Fire spells]]\n|[[Fire Strike]], [[Fire Bolt|Bolt]], [[Fire Blast|Blast]], [[Fire Wave|Wave]], or [[Fire Surge|Surge]].\n|-\n|[[File:Gelatinnoth Mother (ranged).png|frameless|100x100px]]\n|Green\n|[[Ranged]]\n|[[Ranged]] attacks.\n|}\n\n====Culinaromancer====\nAfter you've defeated the [[Gelatinnoth Mother]], the [[Culinaromancer]] himself will attack you. He's level 75, hits high (can hit rapid 25s with magic), but has practically no [[Defence]]. He uses [[Magic]], but tries to get up close to attack as well. Kill him with any attack style and bring food. It is recommended to use armour that maximizes [[max hit]] (and to a lesser extent [[crush]] defence), as his magic attack has a flat 1-in-3 hit rate, so magic defence is irrelevant.\n\nIf you happen to defeat the Culinaromancer with a full inventory the reward lamp will drop at your feet when you return to the Lumbridge castle. A cake will drop to the ground, but you are unable to pick it up.

If this happens, simply log out and back in, and you should have your hellcat back. (It will be following you—you won't need a free inventory space.)\n\n'''Inspect Evil Dave in the Lumbridge Castle Dining Room to start the quest.''' Then go to [[Edgeville]]. The house west of the bank is [[Doris|Evil Dave's mother's]] house. Talk to her and ask her either question. Then, climb down the [[trapdoor (Basement of Doom)|trapdoor]]. You will see that [[Evil Dave]] has gotten into summoning demons as well. However, they are [[Hell-Rat|hellrats]], the weakest form of demon ever. Talk to him, and ask him what he ate, saying he must tell you \"because the magic requires it\". He'll eventually tell you that it was a perfectly spicy [[Spicy stew|evil stew]], like the ones his mother makes. Talk to [[Doris]] (Dave's mother) again. She will tell you that the hellrats stole all of the spices.\n\n[[File:Catching hell-rats.png|thumb|right|Hunting heinous hell-rats.]]\nSince the [[Hell-Rat Behemoth]]s cannot be fought until the subquest is completed, you will need to hunt down hellrats instead. If your cat catches a hellrat, you will get a [[Brown spice|brown]], [[Red spice|red]], [[Yellow spice|yellow]] or [[orange spice]], which contains anywhere from 1 to 4 doses. When your cat catches 7 hellrats it will become a [[hellcat]].\n\nUsing these spices, you must construct the perfect stew for Evil Dave, which will be a stew that contains '''all four''' of the spices, but at different random values between 1-3. This can be a very time consuming process, so to conserve spices and save a lot of time with this, focus on finding out one spice potency at a time.\n\nStart off by using (1) dose of one colour on a stew and give it to Evil Dave. He will then eat and comment on your stew, there are two outcomes from this:\n\n'''''Correct: '''''If he says, ''\"one of the spices is correct, the rest are incorrect\"''  that means the current number you used is correct. Write it down.\n\n'''Incorrect:''' If he says \"none of them are right\", you will need to try again. Make a stew with two doses of spice in it. If it works, the correct amount of that spice is two. If Dave still doesn't like it, you ''know'' the correct amount of spice is 3. You do not need to \"confirm\" it any further.\n\n'''At most, you will need six doses of each spice''', as you cannot put more than three doses of a single spice in one stew. Keep doing this, and eventually you will find out 1 value for each of the 4 spices.\n\n'''Pay attention when adding spices to the stew.''' Using a spice again quickly, before it is updated to reflect the spice's value after the first use, will result in the spice not being used. Looking in the game chatbox to make sure the spice has been added for each usage is recommended.\n\nMake this final stew with the correct values of spice and give it to Evil Dave, and he will say that it is correct. He will not eat all of the stew this time. '''Make sure you finish the entire dialogue!''' Bring it back to Evil Dave in [[Lumbridge]]; make sure you do not eat the stew, or you will have to go back and get the spices again.\n\nExcess spices can be dropped or kept in the bank to make more spicy stews for personal use. Note, that they may be decanted to 4-dose items much like potions\n\n===Rewards===\n----\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Recipe for Disaster/Freeing Evil Dave\n|image = [[File:Recipe for Disaster (Freeing Evil Dave) reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Cooking|7,000}} [[Cooking]] experience\n*The ability to catch [[hellrat]]s to get a [[Hellcat]]\n*The ability to have your cat fight [[Hell-Rat Behemoth]]s\n*The ability to add coloured spices to [[stew]] by catching hellrats ([[Spicy stew]]s can boost and lower certain stats)\n*Further access to the [[Culinaromancer's Chest]]\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n{{Freeing Evil Dave}}\n{{Recipe for Disaster}}"

If you have a [[Ninja monkey greegree|ninja greegree]] (required), equip it and complete the agility course. Otherwise, attempt the rope swing as a human. You will fall and be put in jail. Then you can equip a different greegree, pick the lock and leave.\n\nYou can also get to Ape Atoll by going to the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the [[Grand Tree]] and speaking to [[Daero]].\n\n====Greegrees====\n'''Note: if you already obtained the ninja, zombie and gorilla greegrees during [[Monkey Madness I]], you can skip this section.'''\n{{Needed|3,000 [[coins]] or 3 [[monkey talisman]]s|recommended=Combat equipment to kill a [[ninja monkey]] and a [[zombie monkey]], Ranged or Magic equipment to kill a [[monkey guard]], Prayer potions, stamina potions and food for combat and running through Ape Atoll dungeon}}\n\nIn order to make the three required greegrees, you must bring a [[monkey talisman]] and the respective bones to [[Zooknock]] (located at the end of the [[Ape Atoll Dungeon]]). Monkey talismans can be purchased from the rune salesman [[Tutab]] on ape atoll for 1,000 coins each, or obtained for free from the [[Monkey Child]].\n\nOnce you land on Ape Atoll, head north with a greegree equipped (use the [[Karamjan monkey greegree|karamjan greegree]] if you do not have the others) and pass through the gate. Purchase three monkey talismans from the rune salesman. Next, kill a [[Monkey Guard]] and take its bones. Monkey Guards are located near the prayer altar on Ape Atoll. Make sure to use Ranged or Magic and [[safespot]] them,  Melee can be used but Monkey Guards will heal themselves when they reach low health so high damage is needed to combat this. A safespot location is in the north-east corner of the building behind the fire, or to the south behind the ladder.\n\nNext you will need to kill a [[Monkey Archer]]. North of the bank icon on the mini-map are two ninja monkeys (monkey archers); either protect from range or safespot (by standing in the tall grass) to kill one. Make sure to grab the bones.\n\n[[Zombie monkey]]s can be found in the Ape Atoll dungeon (entrance located on the south side of the island). This is the same cave that [[Zooknock]] can be found in. Be wary of traps and poisonous spiders.\n\nEquip any greegree you have already so that the monsters in the dungeon to [[Zooknock]] do not attack you, negating the need for prayer potions.\n\nRubble will constantly fall on you throughout the cave dealing small amounts of damage. This damage is negated if standing under the stone outcroppings when the screen rumble occurs. It is a good idea to bring [[antipoison potion]]s and [[food]]. Kill a zombie monkey in the cave and collect its bones.\n\nSpeak with Zooknock at the end of the cave with all three bones and talismans. Confirm that you want to make another (he calls it a talisman) greegree and then '''use''' the bones and talisman on Zooknock (he will pause after the conversation before giving you the greegree). Repeat this three times with the different bones to get all three greegrees.\n\n====Awowogei's Palace====\n{{Needed|Any [[greegree]], [[M'speak amulet]], [[Monkey nuts]], [[Banana]]}}\nBuy [[monkey nuts]] and grab a normal [[banana]] if you haven't already. Make sure you've equipped one of your [[greegree]]s and your [[m'speak amulet]]. Go to [[Awowogei]]'s palace on [[Ape Atoll]] by talking to the [[Elder Guard]] to let you in.\n\n'''Note: You must have started the quest by inspecting [[Awowogei]] at the table before the Elder Guard will let you through.''' \n\nTalk to Awowogei about his favourite food; he will refuse to divulge it, but will mention [[three wise monkeys|three monkeys]] in the temple. The three monkeys are located in the temple north of Awowogei, in the north-west corner of the ground floor. Tell them that you're planning a surprise party for the king. They will tell you to stuff the [[snake corpse|corpse]] of a [[big snake]] with [[Sliced banana|banana slices]] and monkey nut paste. If you have a banana and the monkey nuts with you, speak to them again, twice, one for banana and one for monkey nuts. They will tell you that these are not good enough for the king's sophisticated palate, and that you will need to replace the ingredients with the sacred [[red banana]] and the [[tchiki monkey nuts]]. The normal [[banana]] and [[monkey nuts]] are no longer needed after this point. Be sure to '''<u>speak with all 3 monkeys</u>''' or the red banana tree will not spawn.\n\n'''Note:''' If you speak with the three monkeys with a red banana in your inventory, they will eat it and you will need to get another. \n\n'''Note:''' If your cooking level is at or just above the requirement (or you are boosting) the failure rate for cooking the [[stuffed snake]] is quite high. It is useful to obtain multiple [[tchiki monkey nuts]], [[red banana]]s and [[snake corpse]]s to avoid having to re-gather the ingredients. This can only be achieved by drop picking (dropping an item, retrieving it from its original source and picking up the original), otherwise the player will receive a message deterring it.\n\n====Snake====\n{{Needed|Combat equipment to kill a level 84 [[Big Snake]]|recommended=[[Antipoison]]}}\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Killing big snakes.png|thumb|220px|Killing the big snakes in the pit on [[Crash Island]].]]\n'''Note''': You cannot get the [[snake corpse]] beforehand. If you kill a snake before talking to Awowogei and then the three monkeys, you will get only bones.\n\nLeave [[Ape Atoll]] and return to [[Crash Island]]. Go east until you find a [[pit (Crash Island)|large hole]] in the ground, and enter the [[Crash Island Dungeon|cave]] below.\n\nYou will find five level 84 [[Big Snake]]s. Since they hit hard and are [[poisonous]], [[Protect from Melee]] is advised. Turn it on before entering the cave. Kill one and take the [[snake corpse]]. You might want to grab multiple corpses since you might accidentally burn the snake. Try to stay away from the walls as more snakes (which are scenery) will appear and attack you.\n\n====Red banana====\n'''Items needed:'''  [[Rope]], [[gorilla greegree]], knife, pestle and mortar[[File:Getting red banana.png|thumb|220px|Getting the banana.]]\nReturn to [[Ape Atoll]] and enter the city.\n\nThe [[red banana]] tree is located on the north-west coast of the island, just south-west of the [[gnome glider]] icon. To get the [[red banana]], wield your [[gorilla greegree]], as you'll need lots of strength. Then, go to the west coast and find the tree. Use your [[rope]] on it to get the banana. Do this at least twice, since the three monkeys will eat one of the sliced bananas that you bring back to them. If you forgot rope, [[Ifaba]] at the general store sells some. Slice the [[Red banana|banana]] to get [[sliced red banana]]. You might want to get more sliced red bananas, since you might accidentally burn the snake. \n\nIf no bananas are on the tree, go to the three wise monkeys again with a normal banana and go through the dialogue regarding it until it is finished.\n\n====Tchiki monkey nuts====\n[[File:Picking tchiki bush.png|thumb|220px|Picking the tchiki nuts from the bush.]]\n\nPlayers with access to [[fairy rings]] may use the code {{Fairycode|CLR}} to skip part of the Agility course.\n\nWield your [[ninja greegree]], then go to the south part of town. The [[Ape Atoll Agility Course|Agility course]] start-point is on the other side of a small river. You will need 48 [[Agility]] to access the course. Boosts will '''not''' work for this. Once over the bridge, head south-west near the cliff to enter the agility course. Continue on the course until right after the rope swing to reach the broken hut around a hole in the ground. Go down and pick some [[tchiki monkey nuts]] from the [[Bush (Tchiki monkey nuts)|bush]]. Grind the [[tchiki nut]] into [[tchiki nut paste]]. You might want to create more [[tchiki nut paste]], since you might accidentally burn the snake.\n\nIf there are no nuts on the bush, return to the three monkeys and use the standard monkey nuts on one of them and go through the dialogue regarding it until it is finished.\n\nPets cannot be brought onto the Agility course. If you have a pet following you, pick it up to use the course.\n\nNote: Completing a lap of the course is a hard task in the [[Western Provinces Diary|Western Provinces]] achievement diary.\n\n====Cooking the snake====\n[[File:Cooking stuffed snake.png|thumb|220px|Cooking the snake.]]\nAfter you have everything, slice the [[Red banana|banana]] and grind the [[Tchiki monkey nuts|nuts]], then stuff your [[Snake corpse|snake]] with them to create a [[raw stuffed snake]]. Be careful not to eat them yourself.\n\nGo back to [[Ape Atoll]], equip a [[greegree]] (you will need your [[Zombie greegree]] soon, but cannot run with it equipped), and then go back to the temple. Go down the trapdoor protected by [[Monkey Guard|gorillas]], then down one of the ramps. There is a crack in the wall between the two bamboo ramps. Go through it, and you will see a patch of hot coals. This is where you need to equip your zombie greegree, as the hot coals will prevent you from going to the other side. Go to the long rock on the floor, boost your [[Cooking]] level if needed, and then, cook the snake on it. It is possible to [[Snake over-cooked|over-cook]] the [[stuffed snake]]. You will know if you successfully cook or burn the snake, as there will be an animation when you try to cook it.\n\nTravel back to [[Lumbridge Castle]], and make sure your [[m'speak amulet]] is equipped. '''Right click''' the stuffed snake, and use it on [[Awowogei]]. If you eat the snake, you'll have to get another one.\n\n'''Congratulations!

Return to Lumbridge Castle and talk to him if you have not done so.\n#Talk to the [[Wise Old Man]] of [[Draynor Village]], in the building north of the bank. Choose the option about wanting to ask him something, and ask to talk about strange beasts, and then, ask about the [[Evil Chicken (Recipe for Disaster)|Evil Chicken]].\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Fighting Evil Chicken.png|thumb|240px|A player fighting the Evil Chicken in its lair.]]\n# Enter [[Zanaris]] and use the bank to set up for some [[combat]]: bring your [[Anti-dragon shield]], and whatever you think you'll need to kill the [[Evil Chicken (Recipe for Disaster)|Evil Chicken]] and a safespottable level 227 [[black dragon]]. In case you choose to bank between them, you will need another [[raw chicken]]. The Evil Chicken is level 159 if you are between 58-100 combat — level 170 if you're higher. Once you are ready for the fights, equip your anti-dragon shield, and use a raw chicken (green Raw chicken from Morytania will not work) on the Evil Chicken shrine north of the fairy ring that leads to the shack in Lumbridge (North-east of the fairy ring that you teleport into normally).\n# With your anti-dragon shield (or [[Dragonfire shield]]) equipped, kill one [[black dragon]]. If you are ranging or using a [[halberd]], there is a [[safespot]] next to the entrance and just inside the corridor that leads to a mine. When it dies, the dragon will drop a [[dragon token]]. '''Note:''' If you die whilst killing the black dragon and the evil chicken's egg is in your inventory, the egg will respawn in the nest.\n# Run past the black dragons into the northern cave (not the mining-area to the east), and kill the Evil Chicken. It fights the same as it used to during [[random event]] fights. The Evil Chicken hits frequently with [[Magic]], but for very low damage - it shouldn't be too hard to kill. '''Take note that if you happen to die before you leave the lair after killing the Evil Chicken, all items dropped on death will disappear!''' Pick up the [[Evil chicken's egg|egg]] it drops. \n#Back in a bank, add the egg to the brulee, and then, grind your dramen branch into [[cinnamon]] with your [[pestle and mortar]] and add that too. A game message should now tell you that \"Now it just needs flambeing.\"\n#Put your [[ice gloves]] on, and then, rub the token. [[K'klik]] will appear (you must be in Lumbridge or Zanaris for this to work). Wish for it to flambé your brulee to cook it. You can take up to 50 damage if you don't wear any ice gloves (it is possible to reload the game to stop the scene if you forgot, alternatively you can use the second dialogue option \"Could I just keep your token\" to exit the dialogue & return to the world). ([[Antifire potion]] + [[Anti-dragon shield]] works as well.) If a [[cat]] or [[kitten]] is following you, a glitch may occur where it disappears. Your pet is still following you - simply log out and log back in to fix this or \"[[Call follower]]\" on \"Worn Equipment\" tab.\n#Travel back to Lumbridge Castle and then give the [[Brulee supreme|brulee]] to [[Sir Amik Varze]] to protect him.\n{{Listen\n|title = [[The Fairy Dragon]]\n|desc = The music which plays when meeting K'klik.\n|filename = The Fairy Dragon.ogg\n}}\n[[File:Flambéing brulee supreme.gif|thumb|upright=0.6|[[K'klik]] flambees the brulee.]]\n\n===Rewards===\n----\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Recipe for Disaster/Freeing Sir Amik Varze|image=[[File:Recipe for Disaster (Freeing Sir Amik Varze) reward scroll.png|center]]|qp=1|rewards=*{{SCP|Cooking|4,000}} [[Cooking]] experience\n*{{SCP|Hitpoints|4,000}} [[Hitpoints]] experience\n*Access to the [[Evil Chicken's Lair]], where you can fight [[black dragon]]s (The [[Evil Chicken|fowl beast]] himself has moved on to other things.)\n*Further access to the [[Culinaromancer's Chest]].\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Evil Chicken (Recipe for Disaster)|Evil Chicken]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript}}\n\n{{Freeing Sir Amik Varze}}\n{{Recipe for Disaster}}"

Head to the Feldip Hills (fairy ring code {{Fairycode|aks}}) and talk to [[Rantz]]. He will tell you that he wants to travel to [[Karamja]] to make some type of [[potions|potion]], but before that, he wants you to meet him south-east of his cave. Walk directly south-east towards the transportation symbol on your map. Talk to him again, go through the dialogue; he will kick over a tree and ask you to make it into a boat. Use your [[axe]] on it '''twice''' to make a boat. Talk to Rantz again and he will shoot an arrow to a tree on Karamja. Talk to him once more and he will tell you to cook a [[chompy]] there for good luck. If you don't have any [[raw chompy|raw chompies]], kill a [[chompy bird]] or two and gather the raw chompies before you leave. If you didn't bring Logs, chop down a normal tree in the area to get one log.[[File:Recipe for Disaster - Freeing Skrach Uglogwee - fire location.png|thumb|220px|The location you need to make the fire.]]\nTravel to Karamja:\n*If you have used the [[fairy ring]] tele (Karamja is {{fairycode|ckr}}) then make your way west towards the coastline and then north up the coast until you find a tree with an arrow in it. There are also dead trees to the west coastline if you still need a log.\n*If you have travelled to Brimhaven, travel south past the general store and hug the west coastline.\nThe tree with the arrow in it is north-west of [[Tai Bwo Wannai]] village, just north of [[Banisoch]], who is marked with a dungeon icon - the tree is denoted by the [[Transportation]] icon.\n\nMake a fire next to the tree, and then, use your [[iron spit]] on a [[chompy]] and cook it. If you succeed, Rantz's kids will take the boat to you and take you back.\n\nRantz will tell you to make a balloon toad to use as bait, to catch the [[Jubbly bird]]. (The Rantz near the water, there are two versions of him)\n\n'''<u>Note: Purchasing jubbly from the Grand Exchange will not work. You will be met with the message \"You need to cook your own jubbly meat to set Skrach free.\"</u>'''\n\n*Fill your bellows up on the swamp—then, use them on a toad. You should get around three toads just to be sure, because the next part can fail.\n*Mine the same amount of [[Rock (elemental)|rock]]s as you have toads to the west of the swamp, just north of the Fairy Ring, to get a \"rock\". There is also a mining spot next to Rantz's cave.\n*With the rock and [[ball of wool]] in your inventory, inflate the bellows with swamp gas again; then, use them on your already inflated toad to create a [[balloon toad]]. The ball of wool is not consumed upon its creation, but there is a small chance that it will get used up as you create more balloon toads.\n*'''''Drop''''' the balloon toad south of Rantz's cave or east of the [[gnome glider]].\n[[File:Recipe for Disaster - Freeing Skrach Uglogwee - hunting jubbly.png|thumb|220px|The jubbly bird appears!]]\n*Now, wait for the [[Jubbly bird]] (level 9). If it doesn't appear, you'll have get another balloon toad (If you're having trouble getting a Jubbly bird to spawn, log out and log back in. Note: Logging out will make you unable to attack the bird if it spawns). When it appears, kill it with your [[ogre bow]]. Then pluck it, take the meat, and '''''cook it on Rantz' ogre spit'''''. (Near Rantz's cave) Go back to [[Lumbridge Castle]] and then '''''carefully right-click and use the cooked jubbly on Skrach Uglogwee.'''''

Ask her about dwarves and ale. She will offer to tell you the secret recipe for [[Asgoldian ale]] for the price of 200 [[Coins]] (free with an activated [[ring of Charos]], only 100 coins if you give her a [[plain pizza]], or only 50 coins if you give her a [[chocolate bar]]). She will tell you to add a gold coin to an [[Asgarnian ale]] to get an Asgoldian ale. Buy '''four (4)''' (or six) Asgarnian ales from her (or go to [[The Toad and Chicken]] pub in [[Burthorpe]] and pick up the ales for free), then add a coin to each one as per the secret recipe.\n\nGo to the tunnel under [[White Wolf Mountain]] (a [[Camelot teleport]] or [[games necklace]] are useful for a short walk). You will see [[Rohak|an old dwarf]] in the bar area. Talk to him. He will refuse to bake a [[dwarven rock cake]] for you, but he'll mention the Rising Sun Inn.\n\nUse the Asgoldian ales on Rohak. Quickly give them to him to get him drunk, or he will sober up and you will need to get more Asgoldian ales again.\n\n[[File:Recipe for Disaster Mountain Dwarf cooking.gif|thumb|280px|Rohak creates the dwarven rock cake.|link=Recipe_for_Disaster/File:Recipe_for_Disaster_Mountain_Dwarf_cooking.gif]]\nHe will agree to make you a dwarven rock cake for 100 gold. Give him your [[bucket of milk]], [[egg]], [[flour]], and [[bowl of water]], and he will put the hot cake on the table next to you. You will need to cool it down before you can give it to the Dwarf back in [[Lumbridge]]. '''Warning:''' trying to pick up the cake without any gloves on will cause damage and the rock cake will drop to the ground. Wearing normal gloves avoids damage but the rock cake still needs to cool.\n\nIf you have ice gloves equipped, picking up the cake cools it immediately. If you've forgotten to equip your ice gloves, you can still pick it up with any other gloves (otherwise it will likely despawn before you can bank and return and you will need to bring Rohak with all of the ingredients again), so simply bring it to a bank, drop it there, and pick it up again with ice gloves on.\n\nWithout ice gloves, you have to kill an [[icefiend]] with the rock cake in your inventory. The other option is to leave it in the bank, though you will have to wait several hours for it to cool down. You can find icefiends on [[Ice Mountain]], west of the [[Edgeville Monastery]].\n\nOnce you have cooled the rock cake, return to the Lumbridge castle and use it on the frozen dwarf.\n\n===Rewards===\n----\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Recipe for Disaster: Freeing the Mountain Dwarf\n|image = [[File:Recipe for Disaster (Freeing the Mountain Dwarf) reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Slayer|1,000}} [[Slayer]] experience\n*{{SCP|Cooking|1,000}} [[Cooking]] experience\n*Further access to the [[Culinaromancer's Chest]]\n*Ability to obtain additional [[dwarven rock cake]]s from Rohak for either 100 coins or the raw ingredients\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n{{Freeing the Mountain Dwarf}}\n{{Recipe for Disaster}}"

He will tell you to talk to [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] in [[Falador Park]] to be tested. In order to be able to be tested, '''you need to have an empty inventory''' and no items equipped.\n\nNow, head to Falador Park, and talk to Sir Tiffy Cashien. He will tell you that you must go through a mental test. Sir Tiffy Cashien is sitting on a bench at the entrance for Falador Park.\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:Sir Tiffy Cashien chathead.png|left]]\n[[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] will take you to the testing grounds. There are seven different testing rooms. In each room, there is a yellow portal at the beginning of the room (takes you back to [[Falador]]) and a yellow portal at the end of the room, which you may use to travel to the next room after you pass the test. You need to complete five in a row. Which five you'll get, as well as the order that they are in, is completely random. However, you will '''always''' be required to defeat [[Sir Leye]] in one of the five tests. If you fail a test, you have no choice but to return to Falador and start over.\n{{Clear|left}}\n===Sir Kuam Ferentse===\n[[Sir Kuam Ferentse|He]] tells the player that they must defeat [[Sir Leye]], who is level 20. Sir Leye has been blessed by [[Saradomin]] so that no blade may harm him. There are four weapons nearby: a [[steel sword]], [[steel claws]], a [[steel battleaxe]], and a [[steel warhammer]]. Any of the weapons can be used to damage Sir Leye, but the player must choose the warhammer (as it is the only non-bladed weapon) or may opt to fight unarmed for the final blow to kill him. If the player is wielding a bladed weapon when he dies, they will fail the test. '''Note:''' [[Skiller]]s can trap Leye in the corners of the room and [[flinch]] him by waiting for his HP bar to go away and then hitting and running. Skillers may find this part impractical because Sir Leye is very difficult to get into the corner positions ''and'' he will take damage very slowly, to the point where he may heal faster than the damage being done. One of the corners where flinching is possible is on the south-west corner. Sir Leye should be on the south tile with the player on the west tile. Wait until his HP bar disappears, then attack and move back to the west tile. Setting this up is tricky and requires patience.\n\n===Sir Spishyus===\nRight next to [[Sir Spishyus|him]], you'll see a 5&nbsp;kg chicken, a 5&nbsp;kg bag of grain, and a 5&nbsp;kg fox. You must get all three of them across a bridge that only supports five kilograms at a time. The tricky part is that if you leave the fox and chicken alone, the fox will eat the chicken. The chicken will also eat the bag of grain if the two of them are left alone.\n[[File:Recruitment Drive - Walking across the bridge.png|thumb|Crossing the bridge.]]'''Option 1'''\n{{Checklist|*Take the chicken to the other side, since the fox and grain are the only pair that actually get along.\n*Drop the chicken, then come back and grab the grain.\n*Take it to the other side then grab the chicken and drop the grain.

Then take the chicken back to the start.\n*Grab the grain, drop the chicken, and take the grain across the bridge.\n*Drop the grain, then go back to the beginning for the chicken and take it across.\n}}\nOnce you complete the puzzle, the door now unlocks and you can proceed to the next puzzle via the portal.\n\n===Lady Table===\n[[File:Recruitment Drive - Statue Room.png|thumb|The bronze, silver, and gold statues used in the memory test.]]\n'''Important:''' Take a screenshot of the statues as you enter the room (or remember the statues if you have a good memory). You only have a few seconds after you enter the room! If you talk to Lady Table before the room changes, the room won't change until you exit the chat dialogue, so you can use this time to study the room layout.\n\n[[Lady Table]] will test your memory. She will have 11 statues of a knight in front of her. There are supposed to be 12, but one has been taken away. You will have a few seconds to look at the statues, then the missing one will be returned. You must then touch the one that was missing.\n\nThe trick to passing this one is to analyse the types of statues. There should be four statues of each colour: bronze, silver, and gold. First, see which colour only has '''three statues'''. After you figure out the colour, figure out the weapon. There are four weapons: [[sword]], [[halberd]], greataxe, and [[mace]]. Figure out which weapon is missing. After you have figured it out, touch the statue.\n\n===Miss Cheevers===\nThere are many bookcases and crates with items. Search everything (including the chest) and take everything. Some of the items you find are not needed for the solution, such as the [[alchemical notes]] that only contain hints. There are two doors that you must get through. The first door is missing a handle, while the second one is locked.\n\n=====For the first door=====\n[[File:Recruitment Drive - Pouring liquid on the handle.png|thumb|Using the [[vial of liquid]] on the new handle.]]\n{{Checklist|\n*Take the metal spade, and use it on the Bunsen burner to remove the wood.\n*Use the metal spade (without handle) on the stone door.\n*Use the [[Cupric Sulfate]] (not to be confused with the other orange cupric powder!) on the door with the metal spade in it\n*Use a vial of liquid on the door.\n*The metal spade will expand and be jammed in the hole, and you can now open the door.\n}}\n\n=====For the second door=====\n{{Checklist|\n*Use a [[vial of liquid]] on the tin (which looks like a [[cake tin]]);\n*Use [[gypsum]] on the tin. Do not use the liquids on each other.\n*Use the tin with the lumpy white liquid inside of it on the key (on the ground south of the portal you came from) to get an imprint of the ''key''.\n*Use [[tin ore powder]] on the tin.\n*Use [[cupric ore powder]] on the tin.\n*Use the tin on the Bunsen burner to make a duplicate [[Bronze key (Recruitment Drive)|bronze key]].\n*Use a [[knife]], [[chisel]] ''or'' [[bronze wire]] on the tin to obtain the bronze key; you can now use the bronze key on the door to open it.\n}}\n===Sir Ren Itchood===\nWhen you talk to [[Sir Ren Itchood]], he will speak in riddles, the answer to which is a four letter word, made up of the first letter of each line of his riddle. Use the answer to unlock the combination lock on the next door. The possible solutions are: '''BITE''', '''FISH''', '''LAST''', '''MEAT''', '''RAIN''' or '''TIME'''.\n\n===Ms. Hynn Terprett===\n[[Ms. Hynn Terprett|She]] will give you a multiple choice riddle. There are many to choose from - they are as follows:\n\n*'''Riddle:''' ''Imagine that you have been captured by an enemy. You are to be killed, but in a moment of mercy, the enemy has allowed you to pick your own demise - being drowned in a lake of acid, burned on a fire, thrown to a pack of wolves that have not been fed in over a month or thrown from the walls of a castle, many hundreds of feet high.''\n**'''Answer:''' Being fed to the wolves - wolves cannot survive for 30 days without food, thus they would all be dead.\n*'''Riddle:''' ''I have both a husband and daughter. My husband is four times older than my daughter. In twenty years time, he will be twice as old as my daughter. How old is my daughter now?''\n**'''Answer:''' Her daughter is 10 years old. Writing out the given information in the form of the equation <math>4x+20=2(x+10)</math>, we can find easily the daughter's age 𝑥. Balancing the equation gives us <math>\\left ( \\frac{4x+20=2(x+20)}{2} \\right )=\\bigl((2x+10)-10=(x+20)-10\\bigr)=\\bigl(2x=x+10\\bigr)</math>, from which we can finally subtract an 𝑥 from each side to get  <math>x=10</math>.\n*'''Riddle:''' ''I dropped four identical stones, into four identical buckets, each containing an identical amount of water. The first bucket was at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, the second was at 33 degrees, the third was at 34 and the fourth was at 35 degrees. Which bucket's stone dropped to the bottom of the bucket last?''\n**'''Answer:''' The first bucket (Bucket A). At 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celcius) the bucket of water is frozen, so the stone never reaches the bottom.\n*'''Riddle:''' ''Counting the creatures and humans in RuneScape, you get about a million inhabitants. If you multiply the fingers on everything's left hand by zero, how many would you get?''\n**'''Answer:''' Zero. You are multiplying by zero, which yields zero.\n*'''Riddle:''' ''Which of the following is true? The number of false statements here is one. The number of false statements here is two. The number of false statements here is three. The number of false statements here is four. How many false statements are there?''\n**'''Answer:''' Logic dictates that the number of false statements must be three. There are four possible answers, so for one of them to be true, all others must be false.\n\n===Sir Tinley===\nTalk to [[Sir Tinley]],  click on \"continue\". Stand still for eight seconds, do not click on '''anything''' after clicking continue, or the player will fail this task.\n\n====Finishing up====\nAfter completing all five tests subsequently, you will automatically be teleported back into [[Falador Park]] where [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] will congratulate you on a job well done.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n<!-- 10000.5 experience is accurate see - https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Recruitment_Drive?diff=13820507&oldid=13775429 -->\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Recruitment Drive\n|image = [[File:Recruitment Drive reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n* {{SCP|Prayer|1,000.5}} [[Prayer]] experience\n*{{SCP|Herblore|1,000.5}} [[Herblore]] experience\n*{{SCP|Agility|1,000.5}} [[Agility]] experience\n*3,000 [[coins]]\n*Access to [[initiate armour]].

While [[Mountain Daughter]] plays Asleif's singing, [[Sins of the Father]] plays a melancholy tune, and [[Monkey Madness II]] plays monkey chattering, [[Regicide]] and Recruitment Drive play nothing.\n* When asking [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] about ''\"Testing...?\"'' near the beginning of the quest, the player mentions fetching common items and delivering them across the country, a reference to the quest [[One Small Favour]].\n* Prior to [[Update:Diversity & Inclusion Changes and Quest Speedrunning Updates|an update]] on [[9 November]] [[2022]], [[Sir Leye]] could only be defeated by female characters, as it was said he had been blessed by [[Saradomin]] so that no \"man\" could defeat him. His former invincibility against any man may have been a reference to the prophecy of Glorfindel, featured in J. R. R. Tolkien's novel ''{{WP|The Lord of the Rings}}'', for the Witch-king of Angmar fell not by \"the hand of man\". The prophecy was fulfilled as he is killed by Éowyn, princess of Rohan.\n* All of the knights' names are puns:\n** Sir Tiffy Cashien - Certification\n** Sir Kuam Ferentse - Circumference\n** Sir Leye - Surly\n** Sir Spishyus - Suspicious\n** Miss Hinn Terprett - Misinterpret\n** Sir Tinley - Certainly\n** Sir Ren Itchood - Serenitude\n** Lady Table - Lay the Table\n** Miss Cheevers - Mischievous\n** Sir Vey - Survey\n** Sir Amik Varze - Ceramic Vase\n** Sir Vyvin - Surviving\n** Sir Renitee - Serenity\n** King Vallance was presumably once Sir Vallance - Surveillance\n** Sir Rebral - Cerebral\n\n{{Recruitment Drive}}"

'''The coal, pot, strip of cloth, pestle and mortar, limestone, and gloves do not need to be brought to [[Tirannwn]].''' If players reach Tirannwn and realise that they have forgotten something, it is a ''very'' long journey back from the [[bank]].\n\n===Starting out ===\nYou may be approached by the [[King's Messenger]], but this is not required. Talk to [[King Lathas]]. He will tell you to go through the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] again to the western darklands. Once there, you are to meet some scouts of his. '''''You must speak to King Lathas and be informed of your new mission before going through the Underground Pass; otherwise, you won't be able to enter Iban's Temple.''''' The quest log will indicate the quest is started by showing a description of what must be done rather than the requirements. \n\n===First trip===\n:'''Note:''' There are '''no''' accessible [[banks]] beyond the Underground Pass.\n{{Needed|[[Arrows]] that can be made into [[fire arrows]], a [[bow]] that can shoot them, a [[rope]], a [[spade]], gear and items to kill a level 110 enemy that uses melee, and at least 2-3 [[Agility]] [[boosts]] (such as 1-2 [[Summer pie]]s) if you are below level 56 Agility.|recommended=An [[axe]] or [[coins]] to buy food,  a form of [[antipoison]] (4 doses should be enough), [[weight-reducing clothing]], and a [[pickaxe]] if mining the [[limestone]] before it is required, though it can be obtained in the [[Limestone Mine]] instead. Armour is not required when using a safespot or [[Protect from Melee]]. [[Prayer potion]]s or a [[Falador shield]] may be used if using Prayer.}}\n\nSee the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|separate guide]] for how to get through the pass. If you have just enough [[agility potion]]s to complete the required elf traps, do not waste them here as it takes another voyage through the pass to get back to the elf lands.\n\nOnce you are at [[Iban]]'s temple (where you encounter him during Underground Pass), go in and talk to [[Koftik]] if you require food. Simply climb down the [[Well of Voyage]] and go out of the cave.\n\n===Isafdar ===\nWelcome to Tirannwn! Go into the forest just a little bit and wait for an elf named [[Idris]] to spawn and start a dialogue with you. '''This may take a little while. If he spawns but does not talk to you, hop worlds and try again'''. He will question why you are here, but he is slain by [[Essyllt]] and [[Morvran]] before he has the chance to finish. They will tell you to talk to [[Lord Iorwerth]], who can be found at the camp in the north-west corner of the forest.\n\nBefore proceeding with the quest, here is a detailed map of [[Tirannwn]]:\n\n[[File:Isafdar map.png|600px|centre]]\n\nAs you navigate the forest, you will encounter four different obstacles:\n*<u>[[Dense forest]]</u>: You will learn how to navigate this obstacle after speaking to an [[Elf Tracker]] later in the quest. 56 [[Agility]] is required to push through the dense forest, though this is not required to return back to the starting point of this obstacle (e.g., returning from [[Tyras Camp]] to the forest). This obstacle cannot be failed. '''Note:''' Players under level 56 agility can use the fact that most dense forests only have an agility requirement one way through the forest. It is advised to attempt passing through the forest before taking a bite or sip from your boosting item.\n\n*<u>[[Leaves (trap)|Leaf trap]]</u>: This obstacle is a pitfall that appears as a circle of leaves on the ground. '''Click \"Jump Over\" on the side of the trap that is closest to where you are standing.''' If you ignore or fail the trap, you will fall through the leaves and lose 15 [[HP]].\n\n*<u>[[Tripwire]]</u>: You will see two rocks connected by a thin wire with four small crossbows pointing at them. Right click between the rocks to step over the tripwire. If you ignore or fail the trap, you will lose 10 [[HP]] and be [[poison]]ed, starting at 2 HP.\n\n*<u>[[Sticks (trap)|Stick trap]]</u>: This obstacle appears as some sticks on the ground. Click \"Pass\" on the obstacle. If you ignore or fail the trap, you will lose 8 [[HP]]. If you stand in front of the trap by exactly one square, and repeatedly 'spam'-click the trap until your character moves over, you will negate any damage and never fail this trap, no matter your agility level. If you stop clicking for just one tick, your character will attempt to walk, and may fail and take damage! So make sure to keep clicking until your characters moves automatically.\n\n=== Getting through the forest===\nMake your way to the [[Iorwerth Camp]] in the north-west corner. See the map above for reference. Along the way you can kill and cook [[Rabbit|rabbits]] for food if needed.\n*From the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] exit, go west and take the south split in the path to avoid the stick trap.\n* Keep going west until you see a leaf trap (pitfall) to the south. Jump over it.\n*Keep going south until you reach two small pools of water. Go west and cross the stick trap.\n*Go up the north-west path and jump over the leaf trap. Keep going north and cross the log balance (Level 45 Agility is required) to reach the camp.\n\nAt the camp, speak with [[Lord Iorwerth]]. He will tell you to talk to his tracker after you tell him that [[King Lathas]] sent you.\n\nGo back down the path you took to reach the camp, but go south when you reach the stick trap.\n\nThe [[Elf Tracker]] is at a small camp just north of the [[Poison Waste]]. He will not believe what you say since you are a human, so return to [[Lord Iorwerth]] to get a [[crystal pendant]]. Note that if you wish to keep the pendant as a souvenir, it '''must''' be [[drop trick]]ed every time you talk to Lord Iorwerth from now on, as well as when completing the quest by talking to [[King Lathas]] - otherwise it will be removed from your inventory or bank. Talk to the tracker again with the pendant in your possession. He will tell you to find the [[Tyras Camp]].\n\n[[File:Tyras guard safespot.png|thumb|220px|A safespot is available to fight the Tyras guard.]]\nClick \"Follow\" on the footprints leading into the dense forest to the west. You will receive a message telling you that you are unable to follow the footprints. Return to the tracker and tell him. You will now be able to climb through dense forest if you have 56 [[Agility]].\n\nClimb through the dense forest just west of the tracker and a level 110 [[Tyras guard]] will attack you, equipped with a [[steel halberd]]. Despite having a halberd, he does not have a 2-square attack range. You can use the mushrooms as a safespot or use [[Protect from Melee]] to make the fight easier ([[Prayer flicking]] is an option as he has a slow attack speed). If you take too long in killing him, he will despawn, and you will have to try to summon him again, or kill the guard by the entrance to the Tyras camp instead. This alternative guard does not despawn, but he does in fact have a 2-square attack range, and his safe spot is more difficult. Lure him to the clump of rocks directly north-east of the dense forest, trap him in the small hollow, and walk east out of his range. He will try to back away from you when you attack from outside his range, but will be caught in the rocks on his west and south. After you have killed one of these guards, proceed to the Tyras Camp, stepping over the tripwire to the north-west if you killed the first guard. Climb through the dense forest to the north and then go west. You will find [[Tyras Camp]] past the dense forest that is south of the [[catapult]]. If you killed the second guard, he may respawn if you do not enter the dense forest quickly enough but he will not attack you after you have killed him.\n\nTalk to [[General Hining]]. He will tell you that you can't see King Tyras. You can buy bread from the general store if you are low on food, but leave one space available for the [[Big book of bangs|Big Book O' Bangs,]] which will be given by Lord Iorwerth upon returning to him. Go back to the Elf Tracker, then talk to Lord Iorwerth (remember to drop the [[crystal pendant]] if you are keeping it).\n\n===Getting the materials===\n[[Lord Iorwerth]] will give you the [[Big book of bangs|Big Book O' Bangs]]. '''Don't drop this book''' - you need it when in [[Rimmington]] later.\n\nTalk to Lord Iorwerth and ask him about all the items.\n\nIn order to build the explosive, you will need a [[barrel of coal tar]], [[sulphur]], and [[limestone]]. Here is how to gather the materials:\n[[File:Regicide - Coal tar location.png|thumb|217x217px|The location to obtain the coal tar.]]\n#Take at least three [[barrel]]s from the Iorwerth camp because you can lose your coal tar when attempting to make the [[barrel of naphtha]]. Another barrel of naphtha will be required for the [[Mourning's End Part I]] quest, so extra barrels now will save time later. Two barrel spawns can be found in the north-east tent. Go back to the [[Elf Tracker]]. Go to the poison waste swamp south of the tracker and fill all your barrels with coal tar. See the image for where to obtain it. The target tile looks no different from the neighbouring grey swamp tiles, but has a \"Take Coal Tar\" option when hovered over.\n#Gather some of the [[sulphur]] from beside the poison waste swamp. You will only need one unless you lose the bomb.\n#If you wish to mine [[limestone]] in the forest, go east of the Iorwerth camp and through the dense forest, and north-east past the gates of [[Prifddinas]]. Find some [[limestone rock]]s and mine one piece of limestone. However, if low on inventory space, it may be more convenient to buy, or mine the limestone later at the [[Limestone Mine]] by the [[Odd Old Man]].\n\nMake '''sure''' you have the [[big book of bangs]], at least one [[barrel of coal tar]], and some [[sulphur]]. After this, it is safe to teleport out of Isafdar.\n\n===Making the barrel of naphtha=== \n:'''Note:''' If you are planning to do [[Mourning's End Part I]], you may make an extra [[barrel of naphtha]] (''not'' a completed [[Barrel Bomb]]) and keep it in the bank.\n{{Needed|The [[Big book of bangs]], the [[barrel of coal tar|barrels of coal tar]] and at least 5 [[coal]] per barrel. Noted coal can be unnoted at [[Phials]] for 5 coins per coal or use the [[Corsair Cove]] bank.}}\n\nGo to [[East Ardougne]] and speak with [[Elena]], who will tell you to see the [[Chemist]] in [[Rimmington]]. Talk to the Chemist about the quest, and he will give you permission to use the distiller. Now, use a barrel of coal tar on the large distiller outside.[[File:Regicide_-_Distilling_naphtha.png|thumb|220x220px|The interface when making a barrel of naphtha.]]\nThe barrel is only used to access the machine; as long as you leave the window open and have enough coal you can still do the distilling. All you need to do here is to get the green bar filled. You can configure the machine ''before'' using any coal.\n\nThe valves can be clicked on their left side or their right side to control what side they go to.\n\nThe idea of using this distiller is to keep pressure stable on its green area (this is the first segment that the needle reaches, the following one being red) and keep the heat on the green area (tips below) as long as possible while adding coal, but there is tolerance for mistakes.\n\nThe pressure valve has 3 positions: Closed, controlled, and released (the last one resets pressure to 0, remember you need some pressure to make the naphtha), it is initially closed (handle on the left side).\n\nThe tar regulator has 3 positions as well: Closed, intake, and afterburner, it is also initially closed and once you put it to intake (handle at the top) pressure will start going up.\n\nLet the pressure go up to the green area, but pay attention to the heat level. ''Add coal as needed, optimally to maintain the heat gauge in the green zone, but it could be played more safely by keeping it well below overheating.''\n\n'''A very easy way to do this is:'''\n\n# Start by using the barrel of coal tar on the Fractionalising still.\n# Turn the valve on the right all the way to the third tick (all the way to the right).\n#Wait for the pressure gauge to land in the green zone.\n#Quickly turn the valve on the left to the second tick (in the middle) to halt the pressure in the green zone. If it landed in the red zone, you could turn the valve right to relieve some pressure, then back to the middle.\n#'''The valves never need to be touched again, and the pressure gauge can be ignored.'''\n# Add 2 coal, and then 1 additional coal whenever the heat gauge falls too low (below, or counterclockwise from, the green zone). '''Don't spam click the \"add coal\" button. If you add too much at once, it is likely to overheat''' and you will have to restart, but this does not make you lose your barrel of coal tar. Simply add more coal to start the process again. Optimally, the process is fast and may use only 4-5 coal.\n\nThe bar on the bottom should start turning green. When it is full, stop adding coal and close the window to replace your empty barrel with a [[barrel of naphtha]]. To prevent confusion, note that the barrel of naphtha in your inventory looks almost identical to an empty barrel.\n\n===Making the bomb===\n\n*Limestone can be bought on the Grand Exchange, or can be mined on the path to [[Paterdomus]], north-east of [[Varrock]]. If you have completed [[Shades of Mort'ton]] you can buy cheap limestone from [[Razmire Keelgan|Razmire]] and you can get there quickly with the [[Grouping|minigame teleport]]. '''With gloves equipped''', use your [[limestone]] on a [[furnace]] to get [[quicklime]], then grind your quicklime with a [[pestle and mortar]] while carrying a [[pot]] to get a [[pot of quicklime]] (gloves are needed to prevent damage from handling the quicklime). You may choose to use the furnace in the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)]] to save time as you will be passing by it in the next segment. Just remember to bring all the ingredients listed below.\n*Grind the [[sulphur]] with a pestle and mortar to create [[ground sulphur]].\n*Use four [[balls of wool]] on a [[loom]] to make a [[strip of cloth]]. (There is a loom in the [[Iorwerth Camp]], and another in the farm near [[Falador]].)\n*Mix the ground sulphur and pot of quicklime into your [[barrel of naphtha]].\n*Use the strip of cloth on it to complete the [[barrel bomb]].\n\n===Regicide===\n{{Needed|[[Spade]], [[bow]], [[arrows]], 2-3 [[rope]]s, a [[cooked rabbit]] (more easily obtainable if you bring an axe), [[tinderbox]] (even if you already have a cooked rabbit), [[barrel bomb]], [[agility potion]]s or [[Summer pie]]s (if boosting).|recommended=[[food]], [[antipoison]], [[axe]] (to cook a rabbit anywhere), runes for [[Telekinetic Grab|telegrab]] to make obstacles and gap jumps easier (especially if you have less than 50 Thieving), an [[Ardougne teleport]], [[Stamina potion]]s and [[weight-reducing gear]] (such as [[Boots of Lightness]] or the [[Graceful outfit]]).}}\n[[File:Regicide_-_Regicide.png|thumb|220x220px|The barrel bomb destroys King Tyras' [[Burning tent (Regicide)|tent]].]]\n'''Note: '''The [[barrel bomb]] weighs a lot, which may make it more difficult to succeed during agility obstacles such as traps and gap-jumping. One strategy to avoid this is to drop the barrel, cross the barrier, and cast [[Telekinetic Grab|telekinetic grab]] on the barrel bomb (but telekinetic grab does not work across most of the jumps on the final floor).\n\nNow that you have the [[barrel bomb]], go all the way through the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] one last time. The coal, gloves, pestle and mortar, pickaxe, and combat gear no longer need to be brought. Kill a [[rabbit]] and cook it on any fire. If you did not bring an [[axe]], there are lit fires in the [[Iorwerth Camp|Elven Camp]], as well as in [[Zul-Andra]] south of Tyras Camp. Then, go to the catapult outside the [[Tyras Camp]]. Talk to the guard, and give him some rabbit meat to distract him. Then, use the bomb on the catapult - you will need your tinderbox for this. (If you forgot your tinderbox, you can buy one from the General Store in the camp). You will see a cutscene of your character loading the barrel onto the catapult and launching it at [[King Tyras]]' camp, where it [[Burning tent (Regicide)|explodes on his tent]].\n\nGo back to [[Lord Iorwerth]]. He will give you [[Iorwerths message|a letter]] to take to [[King Lathas]] and then give you access to the overground pass of [[Arandar]]. Teleport out, and go to [[Ardougne Castle]]. On the way, you will be approached by an elf named [[Arianwyn]] who will break the magic seal on the letter and tell you to read it. You will learn that King Tyras wasn't the main antagonist in the quest and that his brother King Lathas is actually the one serving the [[Dark Lord]]. Return the letter to King Lathas to complete the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Regicide|image=[[File:Regicide reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=3|rewards=*{{SCP|Agility|13,750|link=yes}} experience\n*15,000 [[coins]]\n*Access to the elven kingdom of [[Tirannwn]] and the overpass of [[Arandar]]\n*The ability to wield the [[dragon halberd]] (With level 60 [[Attack]] and 30 [[Strength]])\n*The ability to charter a [[Charter ship|ship]] to [[Port Tyras]]\n*The ability to use [[Iorwerth camp teleport]] scrolls\n*The ability to use [[Zul-Andra teleport]] scrolls and battle [[Zulrah]]}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Regicide is required for the following:\n*[[Roving Elves]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 25 July 2019\n|update = Song of the Elves\n|change = Two barrel spawns have been added to one of the tents in the elven Iorwerth Camp.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The catapult featured in the quest is based on a {{WP|trebuchet}}.\n* A mixture of {{wp|naphtha}} and {{wp|quicklime}} is one theorised composition of {{wp|Greek fire}}.\n*The tent in Tyras camp seems undamaged even when you enter the camp right after the cutscene.\n*You can repeatedly drop and cast [[Telekinetic Grab]] on Iorwerth's message while walking to King Lathas in the Ardougne Castle to prevent Arianwyn from spawning, but when you try to talk to King Lathas with the message in your inventory he just says he's busy and for you to come back later.\n\n{{Regicide}}"

He will appear to be crazy, accusing you of being in cahoots with the frogs at the other side of the oasis, believing that the frogs will enslave all of humanity.\n\nHead to the centre of the oasis, just north of the grove of [[teak tree]]s, and speak to the blue frogs. They will tell you that they simply have gone on strike, as they believe Marcellus is mistreating them. You will then attempt to mediate between the two parties.\n\nReturn to Marcellus, who tells you that he refuses to make peace until they return his brain back, and will only negotiate with their leader.\n\n===Democracy at Work===\n{{Needed|An [[axe]]}}\nSpeak to [[Gary]] or [[Sue]], who will decide to hold an election to determine who leads, and reluctantly asks you to sabotage [[Cuthbert]]'s lily pad so that he does not win the vote in the frog-hopping competition, as they believe he will declare all out war with the humans. They will also ask that you do not let [[Dave]] and [[Jane]] spot you, as they are sticklers for the rules.\n\nSpeak to Dave or Jane, who you find has already set up the lily pads for the election. You will attempt to convince them to let you inspect the lily pads, but they refuse, believing it is their duty to look after them. They will note that they are hungry, and that the oranges nearby are considered a nice treat.\n\nChop down the [[Orange tree (Locus Oasis)|orange tree]] near them; if you did not bring an axe, the stump near Marcellus will give a [[bronze axe]]. With the both of them distracted, sabotage the lily pad.\n\nReturn to Gary and Sue, who will begin the election. A cutscene will play in which Sue and Cuthbert compete; Sue successfully hops on the lily pad, but Cuthbert sinks into the water and dies, as he never learned how to swim.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nThe Ribbiting Tale of a Lily Pad Labour Dispute - chopping orange tree.png|Distracting Dave and Jane by cutting down an orange tree.\nThe Ribbiting Tale of a Lily Pad Labour Dispute - election hop-off.png|The frogs' Election Hop-Off begins.\n</gallery>\n\n===Peace Talks===\nNow that Sue is the leader, she will negotiate with you and ask that in exchange for helping Marcellus by eating flies, he must pay the frogs with oranges. Take this offer to Marcellus, who will ask what the flies have done wrong. You will tell him that they are planning to kill him, but he wants proof of the flies' betrayal.\n[[File:Chest (The Ribbiting Tale of a Lily Pad Labour Dispute) passcode.png|thumb|right|The interface displaying a passcode required to open the chest.]]\nReturn to Gary and Sue, who will suggest you steal something from Marcellus and pin it on the flies. Inside Marcellus' home, search his [[Bed (The Ribbiting Tale of a Lily Pad Labour Dispute)|bed]] for a [[love letter]]; reading it reveals he is in love with someone named Nalia, which is the passcode to the [[Chest (The Ribbiting Tale of a Lily Pad Labour Dispute)|chest]] in his home.\n\n[[File:The Ribbiting Tale of a Lily Pad Labour Dispute - battling Cuthbert, Lord of Dread.png|thumb|300px|Cuthbert, Lord of Dread, returns with a vengeance.]]\nOpen the chest to retrieve a [[plushy]], then place it by the [[Capybara Dung|capybara dung]] to the east to plant the \"evidence\". However, upon doing so, [[Cuthbert, Lord of Dread]], is revealed to have survived the election and proceeds to attack the player. Cuthbert is a level-1 enemy and poses no meaningful threat. However, Cuthbert can still damage the player so can be killed with recoil damage for non-combat accounts. \n\nAfter your epic battle with Cuthbert, Lord of Dread, speak to Marcellus, who will now accept the frogs' terms.

It was released on [[15 August]] [[2005]]. There are 3 parts to Rogue Trader, each one unlocking additional stock from [[Ali Morrisane]]'s store.\n\n'''Note:''' Before you can do any of the parts listed below you have to talk to Ali Morrisane in Al Kharid.\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Ali Morrisane]] in [[Al Kharid]]\n|difficulty = Easy\n|requirements = Completion of following quests:\n*[[The Feud]]\n*[[Rune Mysteries]]\n*[[Icthlarin's Little Helper]] - gives access to [[Sophanem]]\n**[[Gertrude's Cat]]\n|items = *3 [[dyes]] of any colour (to unlock [[Menaphite clothing]]) OR 3 animal pelts of the same kind (to unlock the [[Desert outfit]]). This includes [[cowhide]], [[grey wolf fur]], [[snakeskin]], [[bear fur]], or [[wool]] (not [[balls of wool]])\n*At least 100 coins (for street urchin)\n|recommended = '''Recommended'''\n*~1,000 coins for carpet rides to [[Pollnivneach]] and Sophanem (and back to [[Shantay Pass]])\n*[[Ring of dueling]] to quickly get to [[Al Kharid]]\n*A teleport to [[Varrock]]\n|length = Short (if fully prepared) - Medium\n|leagueRegion = Requires {{RE|Desert}}\n}}\n\n==Runes==\nAfter completing [[Rune Mysteries]], talk to [[Ali Morrisane]]. He will tell you to talk to [[Aubury]] in [[Varrock]] about a rune deal. After doing so return to Ali. He will say that there is an odd lock mechanism on the boxes of runes. Say that you would like to see his selection of runes. You can pick between buying elemental runes or higher level runes, and then trying to open a small or large casket of runes.\n\nThe small casket is easier to open than the large one. For both, you get these three options:\n\nThe '''\"Pick Lock\"''' option has a higher chance of success with a higher [[Thieving]] level and has a chance to break the [[lockpick]] if one is used; the '''\"Force Box\"''' option will have a higher chance of success with a higher [[Strength]] level. It is impossible to open the large casket by choosing either of these options. However, it is possible to open a small one with those options.\n[[File:Rogue Trader - Sudoku.png|thumb|The Sudoku screen.]]Once you click '''\"Examine Lock\"''' you should see a screen that looks like this, but with an incomplete sudoku puzzle.\n[[File:Rogue Trader - Completed Sudoku.png|thumb|A completed Sudoku screen.]]\n\nThe runes substitute numbers in a standard sudoku puzzle. You can either solve the sudoku puzzle yourself or use a sudoku solver (\"runedoku solver\"). The main objective is to line up the runes so that no runes are repeated in any row, line, or 3x3 grid.\n\nAfter solving the sudoku puzzle, you will have the options of either choosing to buy all the runes for a specified discounted price or to see what the runes are first. If you decide to see the runes first, you lose a small portion of your discount - the difference between buying all of the runes before seeing them turns out to be on average 6-10% cheaper than buying them all afterwards.''' '''However, the prices the runes will be at if you choose to see them will still be a lot cheaper than what Ali sells them for when you do not complete a sudoku.\n\n===Strategy===\nA trick that works with the smaller rune caskets is to position the runes as shown.\n\n:1 2 3 4\n:4 3 2 1\n:3 4 1 2\n:2 1 4 3\n\nThe placement of the starting runes varies, but the pattern is always the same. This pattern can always be performed, regardless of starting placement.\n\n==Blackjacks==\nHead south to the town of [[Pollnivneach]] and talk to the [[Blackjack seller]] who is just south of [[Ali the Kebab seller]]. Go through the conversation with him, and choose the 'cunning plan' option. After the conversation, the street urchin will try to get your attention.\n\nTalk to the urchin and pay him 100 coins to make him help you convince the Blackjack salesman that he needs to produce some different equipment. There will be a short cutscene. After that cutscene ends, talk to the Blackjack seller again and then return to [[Ali Morrisane]]. You will be able to purchase a number of defensive [[blackjack]]s from him.\n\nOnce you return to Al-Kharid, Ali Morrisane will still ask that you return to Pollnivneach and ask the Blackjack seller to expand his wares further.\n\nYou can go back to [[Pollnivneach]] and talk to the Blackjack seller about Ali Morrisane wanting him to expand his wares. He is unconvinced that he needs to upgrade, so you will have to convince him. You will bet him that he cannot knock you out with two hits with his blackjack. You will get attacked by him twice, at which point he will agree that they need to be stronger (if it fails, keep trying until you successfully endure both hits). He will now send offensive blackjacks to Morrisane.\n\nYou can repeat the process to switch between defensive and offensive blackjacks.\n\n==Clothes==\nTalk to [[Siamun]] in the building east of the silk stall with the spinning wheel in [[Sophanem]]. If you have completed [[Icthlarin's Little Helper]], you can take a carpet from south [[Pollnivneach]] into [[Sophanem]] or you can use the [[Pharaoh's sceptre]] to teleport to [[Jalsavrah]] ([[Pyramid Plunder]]).\n\nSiamun is a rude, gruff character who wants either three dyes or three hides '''of the same animal'''. Giving him hides or pelts will have him offer a new variety of desert clothes, while giving him dyes will have him offer Menaphite clothing (all detailed below). Siamun will accept [[cow hide|cowhide]], [[grey wolf fur]], [[snakeskin]], [[bear fur]], or [[wool]] (not [[balls of wool]]). He will not accept bank notes. You can bank at the [[Sophanem]] bank if you have completed [[Contact!]], else run to [[Nardah]] to bank.\n\nOnce you have given [[Siamun]] the items, he will begin shipping clothing. The clothes shop is stocked by Ali at this point, if you wish to switch between the Menaphite and desert clothes offered continue on.\n\nIf you talk to [[Ali Morrisane]] back in Al-Kharid, he will ask that you return to [[Sophanem]] and ask [[Siamun]] to make additional clothing. Now you'll need to deliver him whichever batch of items you didn't deliver last time - dyes or hides. If you do so, [[Ali Morrisane]] will stock the other set of clothes.\n\nGiving [[Siamun]] the three dyes will result in Ali stocking red and purple Menaphite items (hat, top, robe and kilt). Giving him three hides or pelts will cause Ali to stock the Fez, two varieties of desert top, desert robes (not the default variety), and desert legs. He will only stock one set of items at a time and you can switch back and forth indefinitely by providing [[Siamun]] with more materials.\n\n==Completion!==\nAfter completing all three tasks (rune boxes, blackjacks, and clothes), you now can buy blackjacks, clothes, and runes (including cosmics and souls etc.) from Ali '''''without''''' having to do the runes puzzles again. Make sure you complete all three tasks though!\n\n==Post-errand task==\nAfter helping [[Ali Morrisane]] with runes, blackjacks and clothing, and completing [[Prince Ali Rescue]], you may engage in optional, additional dialogue with any shop owner within [[Al Kharid]], asking about their opinion of Ali. They will all claim that he is a shifty man, and that he's brought four men from the south to set up business, and has sent them to all the shop owners around Al Kharid to threaten them if they do not work for Ali Morrisane.\n\nThese four men are [[Ali the Farmer]], [[Ali the Guard]], [[Ali the Smith]] and [[Ali the Tailor]], who appear south of Ali Morrisane's stall immediately after you complete his three errands. Speak to any of them, saying that you have heard that they work for Ali Morrisane. They will say that he has assisted them in setting up shop in exchange for a cut of their profits.\n\nSpeak to Ali Morrisane. Tell him that you have heard of his plans of expanding business, and that his men are threatening the other shopkeepers. He will respond by expressing his regret over the situation, explaining that his men are simply overenthusiastic. He then reveals that his ultimate goal is to take control of all the shops in Al Kharid to put an end to these issues.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript}}\n\n{{Miniquests}}\n{{Pollnivneach}}\n[[Category:Members]]\n[[Category:Needs skilling success chart]]"

She will give you a [[Message (Romeo & Juliet)|letter]] to give to Romeo. Go back to Romeo at Varrock Square, and deliver the letter. If you cannot find Romeo, he may have wandered inside the [[general store]] located south of the square.\n\n===Father Lawrence===\nRomeo reads the letter and doesn't know what to do. He suggests going to [[Father Lawrence]], who is located in the church north-east of Varrock Square. Speak to Father Lawrence. He mentions a [[Cadava potion]] and asks you to speak to the [[Apothecary]]. Talk to Romeo first and he will tell you to talk to the [[Apothecary]].\n\n===The potion===\n'''''Note:''' You can save some time by having the Cadava berries in your inventory before speaking to the apothecary. [[Ironman]] players are recommended to grab some [[redberries]] at the same time as the [[cadava berries]], for use in later quests.''\n[[File:Apothecary chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nThe Apothecary can be found in south-western Varrock located west of the [[Varrock Swordshop]], in a building with a purple potion icon. Speak to the Apothecary about the quest, and he will tell you he needs [[cadava berries]], you may need to ask him to talk about something else. Cadava berries can be found on a bush located west of the mine south-east of Varrock. When you have them, return to the Apothecary, and he will give you [[Cadava potion]].\n\nIf you want to make multiple Cadava potions, drop the one that's in your inventory and ask for another.\n\n'''Be careful''' as drinking the potion yourself would result in temporarily knocking yourself out. [[File:Romeo & Juliet - Crypt.png|thumb|Romeo and Juliet in the crypt.]]Now, head back to Juliet, and give her the potion. You will now see a cutscene of her \"dying\", though she really falls into a coma.\n\n===To the crypt===\nGo back to Romeo, and tell him that he must rescue Juliet from the crypt. He needs someone to accompany him, which ends up being you. You will now see another cutscene of you entering the crypt with Romeo. When he sees Juliet's cousin, [[Phillipa]], he forgets all about Juliet and falls in love with her.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Reward==\n{{Quest rewards|name=Romeo & Juliet|image=[[File:Romeo & Juliet reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=5|rewards=}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Romeo & Juliet is required for the following:\n*[[Making Friends with My Arm]]\n*[[Defender of Varrock]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*If you talk to Draul Leptoc, Juliet's father, while carrying the [[cadava potion]], he'll notice it and mention it in his dialogue.\n*If you talk to Juliet again after the quest, she will seem fed up with Romeo.

These elven woods may be reached by travelling with a [[charter ship]] ([[Port Tyras]]), using an [[Iorwerth camp teleport]] or by traversing through the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] or by using the overpass of [[Arandar]].\n\nNote that travelling through Isafdar can be rather dangerous due to the vast amount of traps, that deal up to 15 damage at once and may apply poison. Food and [[antipoison]] are recommended.\n\n===Starting out===\nAfter the events of [[Regicide]], the player decides to help the rebelling elves, led by [[Arianwyn]], against [[Lord Iorwerth]]'s apparent scheme to take over [[Camelot]]. Arianwyn sent out scouts, [[Islwyn]] and [[Eluned]], to guide you to their holdout. However, Islwyn seemingly distrusts any human and will not assist you, as it was an act of humans that led to his grandmother's death. He will mention that his grandmother was [[Glarial]], whose remains you moved from her [[Glarial's tomb|tomb]] to the [[Waterfall Dungeon]] during the [[Waterfall Quest]]. He will be surprised and relieved upon hearing this, as he believes this to be the perfect resting place for her.\n\nIslwyn changes his mind and will help you, on the condition you complete the ritual of burying her. Speak with Eluned to learn about this ritual. She will tell you to retrieve the [[consecration seed]] from her previous resting place. Talk to Eluned before leaving for the tomb or you will not be able to retrieve the seed.\n\nYou will require [[Glarial's pebble]] to enter the tomb. If you have lost this, speak with [[Golrie]] in the [[Tree Gnome Village Dungeon]] to obtain another.\n\n===The consecration seed===\n[[File:Glarial's tombstone.png|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Glarial's Tombstone]]]]\nHaving talked with Eluned, head towards [[Glarial's Tomb]] and use the pebble to enter it. Note that there will be many [[Glarial's Tomb#Restricted items|restrictions]] to entering the tomb.\n\n[[File:Roving Elves moss giant.png|thumb|Fighting the [[Moss Guardian]].]]\nYou will need to kill any level-84 [[Moss Guardian]] to retrieve the consecration seed. Because of the restrictions towards entering the tomb, you will have to fight it using unarmed melee. [[Prayer]], [[food]] and [[potions]] may be used and it is advised to do so. As the Moss Guardian does physical damage, or unavoidable magical damage if the physical damage doesn't land, it is recommended to pray [[Protect from Melee]]. The [[ring of recoil]] will also prove effective. You can wield the [[goblin paint cannon]] to increase your attack speed, as it isn't restricted. You can wear [[H.A.M. robes|H.A.M. clothing]] for a little extra defence bonus. It is also possible to [[Flinching|flinch]] it by standing directly south of the south-eastern pillar when fighting the Moss Guardian directly west of the entrance.\n\nTake the [[consecration seed]] back to [[Eluned]], who has possibly moved to the other location shown on the map. If she has moved, you can switch worlds until she appears. She will enchant the seed by casting a silent spell on it. If you lose the seed after this point, you may return to her for a new one.\n\n===Through the waterfall===\n{{Needed|[[Rope]], [[Spade]], [[Key (Waterfall Dungeon)|Key]] (found in the Waterfall Dungeon) and the '''enchanted''' [[consecration seed]].}}\n\nTravel to the [[Waterfall Dungeon]] with all the required items. Similar to how you entered it during the [[Waterfall Quest]], board the raft in the middle of the lake above the [[Baxtorian Falls]]. It will crash just before the waterfall. Then, ''use'' the rope on the rock to the south, followed by the dead tree hanging on the edge. You will then find yourself in front of the dungeon entrance.\n\nInside the dungeon, search the northernmost crates in the eastern room to find a [[Key (Waterfall Dungeon)|key]]. With this key, open the locked doors in the western rooms, and proceed to the room with the [[Chalice of Eternity]]. Bury the seed anywhere next to the chalice to complete the ritual, laying [[Glarial]]'s spirit to rest.\n[[File:Planting consecration seed.gif|thumb|The player plants the [[consecration seed]], with a crystal tree growing afterwards.]]\n\n===Ending===\nHead back to [[Islwyn]] to claim your reward. You will be given a choice between a free, but partly used, [[crystal shield]] or [[crystal bow]]. Both can be bought later from him, for {{NoCoins|750,000}} and {{NoCoins|900,000}} coins respectively. These items have charges that deplete when using them, after which they will become unusable until recharged by [[Ilfeen]], for a varying cost.\n\n'''Note:''' Ilswyn and Eluned ''do not continue travelling between their two camps'' after this quest has been started. They will remain at the same location where the quest was started until the quest is completed.\n\nYou will need the crystal bow for the [[Hard Western Provinces Diary]]. Therefore, in addition to its higher cost, it is advised to take the bow.\n\nIf you have the requirements to start [[Mourning's End Part I]], it's highly recommended to speak to [[Eluned]] after claiming your reward in order to start the quest. By doing so, Eluned will teleport you to [[Arianwyn]] in [[Lletya]], while also granting you a [[teleport crystal]] with 4 charges that can be used to teleport there (and [[Prifddinas]] upon completion of the [[Song of the Elves]] quest). Eluned may have moved locations during the prior dialogue; in this case just switch worlds until she reappears.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Roving Elves\n|image = [[File:Roving Elves reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Strength|10,000}} [[Strength]] [[experience]]\n*[[Crystal shield]] or [[crystal bow|bow]] with 500 charges\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Moss Guardian]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Roving Elves is required for the following:\n*[[Mourning's End Part I]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The dialogue option for choosing the [[crystal shield]] as a quest reward is \"I don't like running and hiding behind mushrooms. Give me the shield!\". This refers to how the [[Tyras guard]] can be safespotted in [[Regicide]].\n\n{{Roving Elves}}"

He'll say that since you took up the position of regent, [[King Vargas]] has grown bored and both he and [[Queen Sigrid]] have begun threatening each other with another war.\n\nSpeak to [[Prince Brand]] or [[Princess Astrid]], found in either of the two rooms next to the throne room, and a cutscene will follow. Prince Brand suggests that you convince the King and Queen Sigrid to marry to prevent further catastrophe, which Princess Astrid excitedly agrees upon.\n\n=== Stolen goods ===\nSpeak to the King. He'll say that several items from many of Miscellania's citizens have been going missing, and that you should investigate.\n\nFind and speak with either [[Gunnhild]] by the herbs, [[Leif]] by the trees, [[Fisherman Frodi|Frodi]] on the dock, or [[Miner Magnus|Magnus]] by the mines (they will all say the same thing, you only need to talk to one of them). Apparently, [[Etceteria|Etceterian]] soldiers came to ask for tithes, the workers refused, and the next day items were stolen.\n\nTalk with the King again. He'll send you to discuss this situation with Queen Sigrid.\n\n===More stolen goods===\nSpeak with Queen Sigrid in [[Etceteria]]. She'll tell you to talk to her citizens about things gone missing, criticising the king whenever she gets the chance.\n\nGo downstairs to speak to one of the Etceterian citizens such as [[Helga]], [[Haming]], or [[Matilda]]. They will tell you the same story as the workers in [[Miscellania]], only with the roles reversed.\n\nSpeak again with Queen Sigrid and update her on the known information. Soldiers have been mentioned in both stories, yet neither side has an army. She'll say this is your responsibility due to your position as regent and demand you solve things.\n\n'''''Note:''' Be sure to have the things you will need for the fight at this point, utilising the bank directly north on Etceteria. Remember to take [[antipoison]] potions and [[prayer potion]]s as needed. It is recommended to leave about 10 inventory spaces open for items you're going to use later on during the quest.''\n\n===To the dungeon with you!===\n[[File:Royal Trouble Meddling Kids.png|thumb|The sailor explains about the island's dungeons and recent visitors.]]\nGo back to Miscellania and speak with King Vargas to review your conversation with the Queen. He'll ask you to speak with Ghrim about the presence of these alleged armies and the missing goods.\n\nGhrim, assuming these happenings are being caused by outsiders, will suggest you speak with the [[Sailor]] at the docks to find out if he's seen any suspicious characters.\n\nHead to the Sailor at the docks of [[Miscellania]]. He will mention a group of children who came to the island recently, saying they had gone to go visit their family in the dungeon.\n\nThe dungeon is still inaccessible at this point, so speak again with King Vargas to gain access. He'll give you a [[Scroll (Royal Trouble)|scroll]] with his signature.\n\nTake the scroll and enter the dungeon within Miscellania's castle walls (look for the dungeon icon on the [[minimap]]), and you will arrive in a small underground settlement. \n\nGo to the pub and speak with a [[dwarf]] called [[Donal]].\n\n===Repairing the lift===\n'''''Items required:''' 9 free inventory spaces, 5 coal (or you can mine the coal from the chamber with a pickaxe you can find near the dwarf miners).''\n[[File:Royal Trouble lift fixed.png|right|thumb|250px|The lift is operational again.]]Upon speaking with Donal, he'll talk about a monster deep within the caves. He'll give you a [[mining prop]] to get through the passage and into a room with a broken lift.\n\nHead up north, and you will see two dwarf miners. Pick up a [[pickaxe]] from the rock if you need one.\n\nUse the mining prop on the [[Crevice (Miscellania Dungeon)|crevice]] and squeeze through it.\n\nNow, you need to repair the lift using items found in the boxes in the chamber:\n\n#First, take an [[engine]] and three [[beam]]s, three [[pulley beam]]s, and two [[rope]]s from the crates.\n#Before you start assembling the whole structure, add five chunks of [[coal]] to the engine (this can also be done last, after step 8). ''If you did not bring coal with you, the chamber has four coal rocks as well as a pickaxe near the dwarves if you forgot one.''\n#Use a pulley beam on the broken scaffold on the east side of the room to attach it.\n#Use a beam on a pulley beam to make a [[long pulley beam]], and then use it with another beam to get a [[longer pulley beam]], which you must then attach to the scaffold.\n#Use the final pulley beam on the scaffold.\n#Use a rope on the scaffold to wind it through the pulleys.\n#Use the third beam on the ''platform'' to repair it.\n#Place the engine on the ''engine platform (Note: the engine platform is not the same as the platform from step 7. Rather, it is the one on the tile which faces the engine spawning spot)''.\n#Add the 5 pieces of coal to the engine (only necessary if not already added).\n\nThe lift should be operational now. While making sure you have another rope, click the 'Use-Lift' option on the platform to head closer to the mysteries of the island. ''(If this option doesn't appear, make sure you have added 5 coal to the engine. You can do it when placed on the engine platform.)''\n\n===The burnt diary===\nTake the [[plank]] and enter the small [[Tunnel (Miscellania Dungeon)|tunnel]] on the east wall. Continue travelling east and use a rope with the overhanging rock to swing across the water.\n\nYou will come across the remains of a fire, search it to get the first part of a [[burnt diary]]. Read the diary, and save it for later.\n\nUse the plank to cross the [[Rocks (Miscellania and Etceteria Dungeon)|slippery rocks]] - otherwise, you may be hit for 8 damage. The plank is not left behind and may be reused every time. The rocks can also be safely skipped without a plank via the [[run trick]].\n\nAs you proceed further into the caves, you will come across two more fire remains, search them to get the second and third part of the diary. After the third fire remains, there will be some [[steam vent]]s in the ground. '''Do not walk across or stand on them as they repeatedly damage you depending on your Hitpoints level.'''\n\nAfter the vents, there will be another set of fire remains, search it for the fourth part of the diary. Going further down into the caves, there will be some rocks lying on the cliffs above your path. '''Do not stand or walk under those rocks as they will fall down on you and deal some damage depending on your Hitpoints level.'''\n\nAfter progressing through the area with the rocks, you will come across yet another fire remains. Search it to find the fifth and final page for the diary. Once you have completed the [[Burnt diary|diary]], you must read it before being able to enter a crevice at the end of the passage.\n\n===Those meddling kids!===\n[[File:Meddling Kids.png|thumb|The children discussing what to do.]]\nEnter through the crevice, and you should see a cutscene involving some lost kids. Speak to them to get the full story. The kids had apparently not been able to pass the trials to become a [[Fremennik]], so they were going to start a war here and then stop it, and be seen as heroes. They are to blame for everything.\n\nTravel out through the next exit, and roam the passages where there are lots of sea snakes and snake spawns until you reach another crevice; squeeze through and kill the [[Giant Sea Snake]] (level 149, with only 100 HP).\n\n=== King of Slither and Thither ===\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Royal Trouble boss fight.png|thumb|250px|A player fighting the Giant Sea Snake.]]\n[[Protect from Melee]] works fine if you want to run up close. From a distance the snake uses ranged attacks so use [[Protect from Missiles]] if [[Ranged|ranging]] or [[Magic|maging]]. Level 60 [[Magic]] and [[Iban Blast|Iban blast]] will be enough to kill the snake quickly. A [[Dwarf multicannon]] can be setup in the boss room to help lower levels defeat the [[Giant Sea Snake]].\n\nIts [[poison]] damage hits 9 so an [[antipoison]] is '''strongly''' recommended. Note that a [[superantipoison]] will also negate any effects for 5 minutes. A player who has around level 70 Ranged, full [[Black d'hide]], a [[Magic Shortbow (i)]], and [[Rune arrows]], for example, should only need 1 dose of normal Antipoison to kill the Snake. Similarly, level ~70 Melee stats with a [[Dragon scimitar]] should also only need 1 dose of antipoison. After the fight, it is also recommended to immediately drink your antipoison because the damage of the poison is very slow, yet heavy.\n\n=== At peace once again ===\nPick up the [[heavy box]] that the snake drops. If you forget to collect the box before leaving, speak to the guard outside the dungeon on Etceteria.\n\nReturn through the crevice. A guard will notice you and help you up, and you will surface near Sigrid's castle.\n\nGo to Queen Sigrid and talk to her. She'll be impressed with you, and she'll give you 20,000 coins as a reward and a [[Letter (Royal Trouble)|letter]] to take to King Vargas (reading it will not affect the quest).\n\nTalk to King Vargas to give him the letter for the rest of your reward.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Royal Trouble|image=[[File:Royal Trouble reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=1|rewards=*20,000 [[Coins]]\n*{{SCP|Agility|5,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*{{SCP|Slayer|5,000}} [[Slayer]] experience\n*{{SCP|Hitpoints|5,000}} [[Hitpoints]] experience\n*Enhanced rewards from [[Managing Miscellania]]}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 9 November 2022\n|update = Diversity & Inclusion Changes and Quest Speedrunning Updates\n|change = You may now choose to romance either the handsome Prince Brand or the beautiful Princess Astrid, regardless of your character’s gender.

Well I didn't vote for you!\"''. This is a reference to ''{{wp|Monty Python and the Holy Grail}}''.\n*Armod's full name is shown to be \"Armod Brundtson\" within Armod's Diary. This is a clear reference to him being the son of [[Brundt the Chieftain|Brundt]], the Chieftain of Rellekka.\n*Much of the antics of the kids in the cave and their interactions with the player reference the cartoon ''{{wp|Scooby-Doo}}''. Quotes such as ''\"And we would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for that giant snake!\"'' parody how the antagonist would almost always say ''\"I would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling kids!\"'' in the show.\n*The [[lift manual]] shows that the lift the player repairs is an AMCE brand lift, a reference to ACME, a fictional corporation that features prominently in the [[wikipedia:Wile_E._Coyote_and_the_Road_Runner|''Road Runner'']] cartoons as a running gag featuring outlandish products.\n*The examine text of the [[Sea Snake Hatchling|Sea Snake Hatchlings]] in the cave reads \"A baby sea snake. Snaaaaaaake!\". This is a reference to the ''{{wp|Metal Gear Solid}}'' game series.\n*The examine text of the [[Sea Snake Young]] in the cave reads \"Snake, snake, oh, it's a young snake...\". This is a reference to the {{wp|Badgers (animation)|''Badgers'' animation}} by British animator Jonti Picking (Weebl).\n*The examine text of the [[empty box]] reads \"It says 'To the dungeons' on the side\", another reference to the ''Metal Gear Solid'' game series, in which the protagonist, Solid Snake, can use cardboard boxes with \"To the _____\" printed on the side to sneak around in (with _____ being one of three in-game locations depending on which cardboard box is currently being worn).\n\n{{Royal Trouble}}"

Pirate Pete claims to be a dispossessed nobleman who needs to reclaim his family sword in order to defeat his evil half-brother, who has stolen his lands and is now terrorizing the local lemon farmers. Agree to help him, after which he will warn you about his brother's dangerous ally, the demon Barrelor the Destroyer. Agree nonetheless; Pete will explain his half-brother has stolen most of his fortune, but he will gladly part with what remains for your help. Refuse the money he offers you. He will instruct you to pick up a diversion, knock you out and row you to a secret location.\n[[File:Rum Deal meeting.png|thumb|left|220px|Pirate Pete brings you to Captain Braindeath.]]\nA cutscene ensues in which Pete delivers you, tied up and unconscious, to a worried pirate captain, revealing that the entire story was fabricated. Upon awakening, you will find yourself in a small room with the captain, who will explain that you are in the brewery on the secret [[Braindeath Island]]. He introduces himself as [[Captain Braindeath]], and explains that a week ago the island came under siege of a group of [[Zombie pirate (Braindeath Island)|zombie pirates]] protesting. He needs to make some 'rum' in order to get the protesters' leader [[Captain Donnie]] drunk, after which Braindeath and his brewers can sneak out of the factory and set up a new brewery elsewhere. You will have to gather the ingredients to make the rum. \n\nBraindeath will give you a [[Blindweed seed|seed]] in order to grow the first ingredient, [[blindweed]]. He explains the [[zombie swab]]s have trashed the previous blindweed patches, but that intimidation should be sufficient to get rid of them.\n\n===Brewing \"rum\"===\n====Blindweed====\n[[File:Rum Deal - kitten censor.png|thumb|220px|\"We interrupt this insult to bring you this soothing picture of a kitten. Normal service will be resumed shortly. Thank you for your patience.\"]]{{Needed|[[Rake]] and [[seed dibber]].}}\nIf you don't have the rake and seed dibber yet, go down the ladder in the north-west corner of the building to the basement, and then head south-east past the spiders to find a [[cupboard (Rum Deal)|cupboard]]. There, take the rake and seed dibber from the cupboard.\n\nLeave the building by the southernmost stairway, towards the [[farming patches]]. You may be attacked by [[zombie swab]]s; walk out of combat and right-click to \"Intimidate\" them, which permanently stops them from attacking you. A picture of a kitten will be shown to censor your insults.\n\nThe only usable farming patch is the south-eastern one. Use your rake on the patch to remove the weeds and then plant the seed (requires {{SCP|Farming|40|link=yes}}). Wait a few minutes for the blindweed to grow; you will receive the notification \"''I wonder how my blindweed is coming along...''\". Harvest the crop. '''''Note:''' Should you lose the blindweed after this, Braindeath will give you some he had had in storage all along.''\n\n[[File:Rum Deal Hopper.png|thumb|220px|The hopper is in the north-west corner.]]\nReturn to [[Captain Braindeath]], who will tell you to put the blindweed in the hopper upstairs. Use the south-eastern ladder to climb upstairs and then use the blindweed on the hopper in the north-western corner of the room. You can ignore the lever for now. Talk to Captain Braindeath for the next ingredient; [[stagnant water]].\n\n====Stagnant water====\n{{Needed|[[Bucket]].}}\nBraindeath will hand you a [[bucket]] unless you already have one. You will have to travel to a nearby volcano and fill the [[bucket]] with the stagnant water.\n\nLeave the house via the south stairway again and exit the outside fence, then travel north-west to find [[50% Luke]] guarding a small gate (you may equip a [[Ring of charos|Ring of charos (a)]] or use a [[tinderbox]] on him for some amusing dialogue). Pass the gate behind him and travel up the volcano to collect the stagnant water. Return to the house, pour the water into the hopper, and talk to [[Captain Braindeath]].\n\n====Sluglings====\nBraindeath will give you a [[Fishbowl and net|fishbowl tangled in a big net]]. '''''Note:''' If you untangle the fishbowl and net, you have to use them on each other to re-tangle them.'' Head to the [[fishing spots]] near the farming patch you used earlier. You have to catch a total of FIVE (5) [[sluglings]] or [[karamthulhu]] and add them to the pressure barrel upstairs in the building, next to the hopper. Pull the lever, and the brewing control apparatus downstairs will start to spin and shake uncontrollably. Return to [[Captain Braindeath]].\n\n====Evil spirits====\n[[File:Holy wrench blessing.png|thumb|220px|Blessing the wrench.]]\nThe captain will tell you that the controls for the brewery have become possessed, which \"occasionally happens\". He will give you a wrench in order to beat the controls with it, but remarks that it requires a blessing first for the possessing spirit to come out. Head to the west side of the house and get your wrench blessed by former priest [[Davey]]. He will only bless the wrench if you have 47 or more '''available [[prayer points]]'''. ''Note that this does '''not''' drain any prayer points.''\n\nNow, beat up the controls with the [[holy wrench]]. They are located directly south of Captain Braindeath. As soon as you hit the controls, a level 150 [[Evil spirit]] will appear and attack you. His attacks can be negated with [[Protect from Melee]], or by using a [[safespot]] with [[Ranged]], [[Magic]], or a [[halberd]].\n\n====Fever spider====\n{{Needed|recommended=Means to deal damage at range ([[Magic]], [[Ranged]] or a [[Halberd]]) '''or''' means to negate [[disease]] (such as [[Slayer gloves]] or a [[Relicym's balm]]).}}\nHaving defeated the evil spirit, Captain Braindeath will tell you that the final ingredient is the carcass of a diseased [[fever spider]]. You must complete the dialogue with him or the carcass will not drop!\n\nGo down the nearby ladder into the basement and kill a fever spider. Be warned that fever spiders inflict [[disease]] on hit, even with [[Protect from Melee]]; you can circumvent this by using a [[safespot]] or having [[slayer gloves]] equipped, or using a cure such as [[Relicym's balm]]. Collect its carcass, use it on the hopper, and return to Captain Braindeath.\n\nNote that killing the fever spider completes a [[Morytania Diary#Medium|medium Morytania Diary]] task.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"220\">\nRum Deal farming.png|Sowing some blindweed amidst the terrified zombie crew of The Inebriated.\nRum Deal - stagnant lake.png|Collecting a bucket of stagnant water.\nRum Deal - fishing sluglings.png|Using the fishbowl and net to catch sluglings.\nRum Deal - fighting evil spirit.png|Battling the evil spirit.\n</gallery>\n\n===Captain Donnie===\nNow that the 'rum' is complete, collect some with a bucket from the output tap at the south end of the machinery. Braindeath gives you a bucket if you don't already have one.\n\nHead outside and find [[Captain Donnie]] near the farming patches to give him the [[unsanitary swill]]. He will smell the 'rum' and demand you hand it over, downing it as quickly as possible. He will then accidentally disclose the name of his boss, [[Rabid Jack]]. Return to [[Captain Braindeath]] to inform him of this. He will be shocked at Jack's name before pretending he had never heard of it before. He then thanks you for your help and announces the brewery is not going to be relocated, and they will keep the zombies too drunk to be a bother.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Rum Deal\n|image = [[File:Rum Deal reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Fishing|7,000}} [[Fishing]] experience\n*{{SCP|Prayer|7,000}} [[Prayer]] experience\n*{{SCP|Farming|7,000}} [[Farming]] experience\n*The [[Holy wrench]] (while in your inventory, this grants more [[prayer points]] when drinking a [[prayer potion]])\n*Access to [[Braindeath Island]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Rum Deal is required for the following:\n*[[Cabin Fever]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*There are a few references when talking to the brewers:\n**One of the brewers in the 'rum' factory quotes a line from <i>Monty Python</i>'s {{WP|Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook}}: \"My hovercraft is full of eels\".\n**One brewer says \"Game over man, game over!\", which is a reference to the movie ''{{WP|Aliens (film)|Aliens}}''.\n**Another asks, after the player inquires about the priest, \"Do you need a young priest or an old priest?\" This is a reference to ''{{WP|The Exorcist}}''.\n**[[50% Luke]] says he was restored with witchwood, which may be a reference to wizardwood in Robin Hobb's ''[[wikipedia:Liveship_Traders|Liveship Traders]]'' trilogy.\n*Part of [[Davey]]'s blessing is \"Romanes Eunt Domus\", which is barbarised Latin for \"Romans go home\". This is a reference to ''{{WP|Monty Python's Life of Brian}}''.\n*The other type of fish that can be caught besides sluglings is called [[Karamthulhu]]. This is another in-game reference to {{WP|H. P. Lovecraft}}'s {{WP|Cthulhu}}, which is described as having tentacles as a main physical feature.\n*When Davey blesses the [[wrench]], the camera will zoom in on the player who then holds up the wrench and says \"Groovy\". This is a reference to the 1981 film ''{{WP|Evil Dead}}'' and sequel ''{{WP|Evil Dead 2}}'', when the main character Ash cuts his own possessed hand off and replaces it with a chainsaw.\n*When attacking the [[Evil spirit]], the player will say: \"The power of Guthix compels you!\" This is a reference to the movie ''{{WP|The Exorcist}}'', where the priest yells: \"The power of Christ compels you!\"\n*When the player asks [[50% Luke]] \"So what goes on here?\", he says \"You expect me to talk?\", to which they reply \"No Mr Luke, I expect you to die\". This is a reference to the James Bond film ''{{WP|Goldfinger}}''.\n**Also when asked \"So how flammable are you?\", he will reply, \"Don't make me angry! Ye'll not like me when I'm angry\"; this is a reference to ''The Incredible Hulk'' when Bruce Banner tells Jack McGee, \"Mr. McGee, don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry\".\n*If the player tries to pull the pressure lever without putting in the five sea creatures, they will get the message {{mes|You do not yet have the five sea creatures in the barrel!}}, even if they haven't got the message from [[Captain Braindeath]].\n*One of the lines that the zombie pirates say is \"United we stagger\", a reference to the motto \"United we stand\".\n*When getting a bucket of 'rum', a message will appear: {{mes|You carefully fill the bucket with the foul-smelling swill.}} When examining the bucket with 'rum', it says {{mes|Sorry, I mean a bucket of 'rum'.}}\n*The quest title ''Rum Deal'' may be a reference to the phrase ''Bum Deal'', when somebody gets the poor end of the deal, where the player has lots of menial tasks to complete.\n*When examining the Evil spirit, it states {{mes|The pun was intended.}}, referring to 'spirit' being another term for alcohol.\n*Pirate Pete talks about fighting a demon named Barrelor, which is not an actual monster, but later in the quest series the player fights [[Barrelchest]].\n*The blessing of the wrench uses the same animation as the summoning ritual in [[Shadow of the Storm]] using [[demonic sigil]]s. In particular, [[Agrith Naar]]'s symbol can be seen.\n*Using the fever spider corpse on Captain Braindeath will cause him to say \"What are ye doin', lad? I want ye to shove that in the hopper, not in me face!\", and, \"Ye just can't get good help these days...\"\n\n{{Rum Deal}}"

(Or Fairy Ring code {{fairycode|blr}}, or teleport to Ardougne Farm with [[Ardougne cloak 2]] or higher). He'll tell you that his rare [[Kharid Scorpion]]s have escaped and are currently running loose. He'll give you a [[Scorpion cage]] to catch the scorpions with and suggest you go talk to the Seers that live just to the north.\n\n===The first scorpion===\n{{Map|2877,9796|name=Kharid Scorpion|width=250|height=250|r=3|mtype=square|mapID=20|caption=The location of the first scorpion, in the [[Taverley Dungeon]].|align=right}}\nSpeak with any Seer in Seers' Village before continuing with the quest. '''[Note: If you do not speak with a Seer, the old wall will NOT open.]'''\n\n:1. ''The [[Seer]] will tell you that the first scorpion is in a secret room with nasty spiders nearby.''\n\nPick up some [[food]], an [[anti-poison potion]] or [[superantipoison]], an [[anti-dragon shield]] (or [[dragonfire shield]]), and, with less than 70 Agility, the [[dusty key]], if you have one. If you do not have access to an [[anti-dragon shield]] and have less than 80 [[Agility]], read the next paragraph for a description on how to avoid the [[blue dragon]]s in the dungeon. Make your way to the [[Taverley Dungeon]] any way you want (a Falador teleport is the quickest way to get there if your house isn't located in Taverley. A  [[games necklace]] to the [[Burthorpe Games Room]], a [[combat bracelet]] to the [[Warriors' Guild]], a [[Teleport to House|house teleport]] with your [[player-owned house]] set to [[Taverley]] also works).\n\n'''Strategy without [[anti-dragon shield]]:''' The first scorpion will be difficult to obtain on a lower-level account. Players who have not yet started [[Dragon Slayer I]] to get access to the anti-dragon shield can use an alternative strategy that uses the fact the dungeon is single-combat. When running past the blue dragons, ensure a [[baby blue dragon]] is fighting you at all times. Avoid standing too close to adult dragons, and hop from baby to baby and draw their aggression when passing through this part of the dungeon. This strategy is not recommended for [[hardcore ironman|hardcore ironmen]] who are not confident they know what they are doing.\n\nOnce inside the dungeon:\n*With 80 [[Agility]] you should use the shortcut directly to the [[poison spider]]s. The secret room is directly south of the shortcut.\n*With 70 [[Agility]] you should use the [[shortcut]] to the [[blue dragon]]s.\n*Otherwise, walk the long way around and use the dusty key on the gate to the blue dragons.\n\n:If you need to acquire a dusty key, follow the track towards the [[Black Knights' Base]] and kill the [[jailer]] located in the eastern area of the base, who will drop a [[jail key]]. Use the jail key on the door of the cell containing [[Velrak the explorer]]. Speak to him; ask if there are any good places to explore, and when he asks you if you want to go further into the dungeon, say yes and he will give you a dusty key.\nWalk south of the blue dragons, west to pass the [[black demon]]s, and north to the [[poison spider]]s. To the south of the two coffins, there's a small room with a false wall that you can search to open (see the inset map).\n\nUse the [[scorpion cage]] on the small scorpion inside this room to catch it ''(if you try to pick it up, it will sting you for 3 [[Hitpoints]] of damage)''.\n\n===The second and third scorpions===\n{{Map|2553,3570|name=Kharid Scorpion|caption=The location of the second scorpion, in the [[Barbarian Outpost]].|width=220|height=220|r=3|mtype=square|align=right}}\n{{Map|3058,3488|name=Kharid Scorpion|plane=1|caption=The location of the third scorpion, in the [[Edgeville Monastery]].|width=220|height=220|r=3|mtype=square|align=left}}\n[[File:Scorpion Catcher - Third scorpion.png|thumb|The scorpion in the Monastery.]]\nReturning to and speaking with any [[Seer]] in Seers' Village will reveal the location of the second and third scorpions. ''(Amusingly, you are not required to speak with the same Seer as you did earlier.)''\n\n:2. ''The Seer will mention a merchant in [[Barbarian Village]] who may have the second scorpion.''\n\n:3. ''Continue speaking with the Seer and he will reveal that the third scorpion is 'in some sort of upstairs room near some brown clothing': the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the [[Edgeville Monastery]].''\n\n\nIt will be quickest to first collect the scorpion at the Monastery, and then head to Barbarian Village afterwards.\n\nThere are many ways to get to the Monastery; you could use the grouping teleport to soul wars and use the exit portal to Edgeville, or you could either teleport to [[Falador]] ([[standard spellbook]]), [[Lassar]] ([[Ancient spellbook]]), to [[Edgeville]] using a charged [[Amulet of Glory|amulet of glory]], to [[Barbarian Village]] using a charged [[skull sceptre]], or you could teleport directly to the Monastery using a [[combat bracelet]]. \n\nOnce at the Monastery, climb the south-east ladder. ''(If you've never been upstairs, you'll have to speak with [[Abbot Langley]] to join their group, requiring 31 [[Prayer]].)'' The scorpion will be right at the top of the ladder, or in the bedroom directly north of the ladder. Use your cage on it to catch it.\n\n\nNow head to Barbarian Village to find the merchant, [[Peksa]], in his helmet shop. He will tell you that he left it in the bed of a relative at the [[Barbarian Outpost]] as a \"surprise gift\". Interestingly, once the location of the second scorpion is revealed by a Seer, players do not need to visit and talk to [[Peksa]] to be able to find the scorpion and use the cage on it. \n\nUse a [[games necklace]] or Barbarian Assault minigames teleport to go to the Outpost, where the scorpion can be found wandering just inside the entrance of the [[Agility training]] area, in the gated building. ''(To get in, you must have completed [[Alfred Grimhand's Barcrawl]].)''\n\n===Finishing up===\nFinally, bring the full [[scorpion cage]] to [[Thormac]].\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Scorpion Catcher\n|image = [[File:Scorpion Catcher reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Strength|6,625}} [[Strength]] [[experience]]\n*The ability to have [[Thormac]] turn a [[battlestaff]] into a [[mystic staff]] for 40,000 [[coins]]\n}}\n\n== Transcript ==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n\n* The player will bring up Thormac's promise to enchant their battlestaves despite this dialogue option not being present.\n* It is possible to obtain multiple scorpion cages by having a full inventory when Thormac attempts to give them to you.\n** It is also possible to catch the scorpions multiple times in different cages. Furthermore, only one full cage has to be given to Thormac to complete the quest. The remaining cages will be kept in the player's bank.\n{{Scorpion Catcher}}"

[[Holgart]] has a boat that he can maybe take you in.\n\nTalk to [[Holgart]], and he will tell you his ship is in need of repairs. He will ask you to go and get him one [[swamp paste]] to fix it up. The best way to get swamp paste is to buy it directly from the [[Grand Exchange]]. Alternatively, you could go to the [[general store]] in [[Port Khazard]], located south of Ardougne - a guaranteed source. Another option is to take a ship from [[Ardougne]] to [[Brimhaven]], ideally do this before you take the boat or teleport there, and buy some from a [[Trader Crewmember]]. This will cost 60 coins extra though (30 coins for each trip). Once you give him the swamp paste, Holgart will appear in a cut scene fixing the boat. Talk to him again to go to the Fishing Platform.\n\n'''Note''': You cannot use [[swamp tar]].

Talk to him, he will tell you about the odd happenings and the hauling up of the sea slugs. Also, pick up the [[broken glass]] on the floor there for later in the quest.\n\n===Helping Kennith===\n[[File:Sea Slug - Drying damp sticks.png|thumb|left|130px|Using the glass to dry the sticks.]]\nPick up some [[damp sticks]] close to the ladder in the north-east corner of the platform, then climb up the ladder. Upstairs, in a room on the west side, past the crane, you will find [[Kennith]]. He will tell you that his father tried to leave days ago, but the fishermen stopped him from doing so. He will ask you to find his father, [[Kent]] and help him.\n\nGo back to [[Holgart]] and talk to him. He will take you to a deserted island, where you will find Kennith's father stranded. Talk to Kent and he will tell you his story. Then ask Holgart to take you back to the platform. Talk to [[Bailey]] to find out the slugs' weakness - they are afraid of heat. He will give you an [[unlit torch]], which he cannot light himself as it is too damp. Use the [[broken glass]] on the [[damp sticks]], which are found near the ladder to [[Dry sticks|dry them]], then rub them together to '''light the torch''' (given by Bailey).

The guard will ask for your help in solving a crime. \n\n'''Note:''' If attempting to start this quest right after the completion of Hazeel Cult, you will need to log out and log back in as the guard will not ask you to help him. \n\nFollow the guard upstairs, where you will find a murdered [[Ceril Carnillean]]. Inspect the various objects in the room, starting with Ceril's corpse. You will discover that Ceril has been stabbed in the back with an \"unusually thin blade\", and that the window has been broken from the outside. Next, knock-at the northern wall to reveal a hidden room. Climb up the ladder, and inspect the chest to find that it has been broken into and emptied.\n\nReturn to the guard and tell him about these findings, and he will then show you an amulet that was found by the window. The amulet bears the symbol of the Khazard Army, with 'Evelot' engraved into the back. He suggests you search for more information at the Fight Arena bar, as he can't investigate the Khazard Army himself, because the army operates with approval from the monarchy.\n\n==On the Trail==\n{{Needed|100 coins, [[Combat equipment]] to defeat [[Evelot]] (level 148)}}\n[[File:Secrets of the North - tracking Evelot.png|thumb|280px|Tracking down Evelot around the Fight Arena.]]\nMake your way south to the [[Fight Arena Bar|bar]] in the south-west corner of the [[Fight Arena (location)|Fight Arena]]. Players can reach the area quickly by use of the [[Watchtower Teleport|Watchtower]] or [[Yanille teleport]]s, or the [[Ardougne cloak|Ardougne Cloak]]. Upon arrival, ask the [[Khazard Barman]] if he knows anyone named 'Evelot', and give him 100 coins as a bribe.\n\nHe says that she recently left in a hurry, and suggests looking around outside. Inspect the barrels just outside the bar entrance to begin tracking Evelot. Next, search the north-west boulders at the end of the trail, then the north-east bush, the tree stump, another set of boulders, and finally another bush (east of you). The trail will lead you clockwise around the periphery of the arena to a rowboat just south of the [[Tower of Life (building)|Tower of Life]], where Evelot will be standing. Upon approaching her, you will enter an instance; she will engage in a short dialogue, after which you will have to fight her. \n\n===Fighting Evelot===\nEvelot attacks with melee, which can be completely blocked with the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer. However, every few attacks, she will use a special attack that disables protection prayers and drains prayer points, so be ready to turn them on and drink a restoration potion if needed. Be warned that even with good armour, Evelot can still hit up to 34 without protection, and she is moderately accurate.\n\nEvelot is weakest to magic attacks, and has decent melee defence. However, moderately high level players should have no problem dispatching her with melee anyway, especially with a crush weapon. Note that she cannot be safespotted, and she is also immune to [[Bind|binds]] and [[Ice spells|freeze]] spells. If you run too far away, the fight will end and you must restart. If you die during this fight, your gravestone will appear south of the Tower of Life, outside the fight instance.\n\nWhen defeated, she will tell you about her role in the crime; she was hired to break in and steal a [[Hazeel scroll|certain scroll]] from the Carnillean mansion, but insists that she was not Ceril's killer. She then delivered the scroll to the Hazeel cultists, only to discover that they did not hire her to retrieve it.\n\n==The Mysterious Benefactor==\n{{Needed|[[Lockpick]] or [[hair clip]]|recommended=[[Ardougne cloak]] (for fast teleport to Hazeel)}}\nMake your way to the Hazeel Cult, by the cave entrance to the [[Ardougne Sewers]] slightly north-west of the [[Ardougne Monastery]] and east of the [[Clock Tower (building)|Clock Tower]]. Players can reach the area quickly by teleporting to the monastery via an [[Ardougne cloak]]. Board the raft upon entry (if the raft is not moving, make sure all [[sewer valve]]s are in the [[Hazeel Cult|correct position]]), and talk to [[Alomone]] who will summon [[Hazeel]] or go directly to Clivet and Hazeel if you killed Alomone previously (Hazeel has been awakened regardless of the player's actions during the quest [[Hazeel Cult]]). Suspicious of the mysterious third party's intentions, [[Clivet]] is instructed to summon [[Khazard]] to the cult dungeon, where the two Mahjarrat discuss the third party still at large. Hazeel suggests that you return to the mansion and question the Carnillean family to find more information.\n[[File:Secrets of the North - lockpicking puzzle.png|thumb|280px|Picking the lock on the chest.]]\nReturn to the Carnillean mansion, and update the guard with your progress; you must talk to the guard before questioning the family, who will otherwise refuse to talk to you. Philipe and Henryeta will not provide much of use, but [[Claus the Chef]] in the basement reveals that he felt a sudden feeling of cold around the time of the murder, and saw a shadow. Searching the south-west shelves reveals a small button that unlocks a wall on the north side of the room, next to the noticeboard. Inspect the wall to enter the passage behind this wall and picklock the chest in the room. \n\nTo pick the lock, move the pins along to specific positions. They will appear '''blue''' if the number is correct but in the wrong position, and '''green''' if that pin is at the correct position. Multiple pins can have the same number. The ordering does not change attempt to attempt. Players who have difficulty picking the lock can use a [[wikipedia:Mastermind_(board_game)|Mastermind]] solver to decode the pins. Fastest method is to guess all 1, anything not green change to 2s and confirm again. anything not green moves to 3, and so forth. You will solve in max 6 guesses.\n\nInside the chest you will find a [[Dusty scroll (Secrets of the North)|dusty scroll]]. Inspect the scroll to see a faded symbol, then take the scroll back to Hazeel and Khazard, who become mysteriously concerned and decide that it's time to return to the North. As Hazeel does not wish to attract any attention from the other Mahjarrat, and since you are on friendly terms with the ice trolls of [[Weiss]], he asks that you accompany them there.\n\n==In the North==\n{{Needed|Combat equipment to defeat the [[assassin]]|recommended=Antipoison, [[icy basalt]] (to teleport to Weiss)}}\nHead to the northern entrance of [[Weiss]]. The fastest way to reach the entrance is to use the [[icy basalt]] teleport, cross the [[little boulder]] immediately to the east, squeeze through the nearby [[Broken fence (Weiss)|broken fence]], and run slightly north-east. Just outside the central area, you will find [[Dead Wolf]] and [[Big Fish (Secrets of the North)|Big Fish]], who are shapeshifted manifestations of [[General Khazard]] and [[Hazeel]]. They will have you speak to [[Snowflake]] and [[My Arm]] and see if they have seen anything odd recently; My Arm will tell you that there was recently a cave-in down in the mine and that [[Goat Poo]] saw a strange shadow whilst investigating it.\n\nReturn to Big Fish, who reveals that the area used to be [[Ghorrock]], a settlement of the [[Zarosian Empire]] during the [[Second Age]], and that the missing crest half was used to seal the prison below. You then tell them of what Snowflake and My Arm told you, and they tell will ask you to meet them in the [[Salt Mine]].\n\n'''Important: Be fully prepared for combat before entering the cave. Make sure to bring antipoisons.'''\n\n===Fighting the Assassin===\n[[File:Secrets of the North - fighting the assassin.png|thumb|280px|The player and Khazard fight the assassin.]]\nHead down the stairs in the main building, and go through the southern cave entrance that's opened up into the prison. This will begin a cutscene where you and Khazard come across an [[assassin]] that you've met during the events of [[Devious Minds]]. He will attack you.\n\nThe assassin, still retaining the [[bow-sword]] that you made for him before, will attack with both ranged and melee; he will react accordingly to protection prayers, so pray against what you're weakest against. General Khazard will assist you in the fight, but don't expect him to handle the assassin completely.\n\nThe assassin cannot be damaged in normal combat, as he is too fast; should you attack him, your chat will read: {{Mes|The assassin easily dodges your attack. You'll need to obscure his vision somehow.|colour=purple|size=14|shadow=no}} To damage him, wait until he throws smoke bombs around the room; once one lands, he can be lured into it, obscuring his vision and allowing him to be hurt. \n\nThe assassin will also throw green vials, which will deal up to 30 damage and inflict [[poison]] starting at 6 damage; they're similar in appearance to [[Divine super combat potion|super combat potions]] and can be avoided by simply running one tile away when you see the animation begin.\n\n'''Note:''' If you die during this fight, your gravestone will appear inside the Salt Mine, outside the cave entrance to Ghorrock Dungeon. \n\nAfter the fight, the assassin will seemingly vanish; Khazard demands an explanation as to how you knew them. After learning of the events, he tells you to talk to Hazeel while he guards the door leading to the prison. Hazeel deduces that a third Mahjarrat may still be hiding nearby with the other half of the crest required to unseal the prison, as two of his Zarosian kin had sealed away a dangerous [[Duke Sucellus|abomination]] in there and rumours began to swirl that a powerful artefact was also sealed with it. While he guards the exit to the dungeon, he tasks you with investigating the area for him.\n\n==Secrets of the Dungeon==\n{{Needed|[[Tinderbox]] - obtainable from a crate near where it is needed.|recommended=}}\nBegin searching various accessible objects in the area and acquire the required items:\n* [[Ancient map]] - crate in the easternmost part of the dungeon\n* [[Lever handle]] - barrel of weapons south of the centre room\n* [[Tullia's letter]] - chest in the south-eastern room\n* [[Duke note]] - damaged table in the south-eastern room\n\nRead Tullia's letter and make note of the purple letters: \"S, p, c, d, l\". By using the ancient map and moving from '''S'''enntisten, '''P'''addewwa, '''C'''arrallanger, '''D'''areeyak, and '''L'''assar, the direction moved would be left, up, left, and down. Input these into the northern gate's lock then press \"Confirm\" to open it.\n\nNext, search the chest inside for a [[strange list]]. Then, use the handle on the lever mechanism, and pull it. Head to the room where you fought the assassin, and inspect the south-western pillar to find a [[jewel shard]] and a [[strange cipher]].\n\nUse the strange list to fill in the blank letters in the Duke note (for example, the first name in the Duke note is Picus), and then match the symbols with the letters in the strange cipher. For example, the symbol for Orcus is >, which the strange cipher displays as the letter L.\n[[File:Secrets of the North - investigating the dungeon.png|thumb|280px|The player investigates the Ghorrock Dungeon on behalf of the Mahjarrat.]]\nCorrectly filling in the Duke note, combined with the symbols from the strange list and cipher, will uncover the hidden message \"BOUND BY BLOOD\". BLOOD is the passcode to the gate in the centre of the dungeon; input the letters into the lock and enter the gate.\n\nSearch the damaged table in the southern part of the room to receive a [[numbers note]], and the crate in the western part for a [[tinderbox]]. Reading it shows the player the number 3241, with \"4: NE\" on the top right. Each number corresponds to the location of a brazier, and certain texts you've acquired have this indicator; the strange cipher contains \"1: SW\", the ancient map contains \"2: SE\", and the strange list contains \"3: NW\". Using the numbers note, you must light the braziers in this order: north-west, south-east, north-east, and lastly south-west. This unlocks the western chest.\n\nSearch the chest to receive a [[settlements note]] and another [[jewel shard]]. Use one shard on the other to create the [[ancient jewel]]; this will be used shortly. Read the settlements note, showing an arrangement of old Zarosian settlements. Using the ancient map, connect each settlement as instructed in the settlements note. For example, connecting \"Kharid-et - Kharyrll - Senntisten\" on the ancient map gives the player the shape of the number 7. Performing this for the other three lines on the note in order will give the player the number 7402, which is the passcode for the northern chest. Input the passcode to receive an [[icy chest]].\n\nUse the ancient jewel on the icy chest to open it, giving the [[icy key]]; use it to unlock the gate south-west of the centre room. A crevice can be found beyond the gate; before entering, it is recommended to resupply and re-gear for both magic and ranged.\n\n==A Strange \"Something\"==\n{{Needed|Ranged and Magic [[combat equipment]] to defeat the [[Strange Creature]] (level 368)|recommended=[[Stamina potion]]s, [[prayer potion]]s, [[ranging potion]]s, [[magic potion]]s or [[ancient brew|ancient]]/[[forgotten brew]]s}} \n[[File:Secrets of the North - fighting the strange creature.png|thumb|280px|The player fights the Strange Creature.]]\nEnter the crevice, where a [[Strange Creature]] will appear and attack. While the boss is among the more challenging quest monsters, players who familiarise themselves with its mechanics will find it to be a reasonable fight; with practice, a player of 85+ combat should be able to defeat the creature with decent gear such as [[blessed dragonhide armour]] and enchanted [[onyx jewellery]]. Stamina potions and a form of prayer restore are both strongly recommended.\n\nBe sure to read the descriptions of its attacks in order to prepare yourself for the fight.\n\n===Overview===\nFollowing the quest, the strange creature's residual energy remains in the form of a stronger variant, the [[Phantom Muspah]], which can be fought repeatedly as a [[boss]].\n\nThe creature has 550 Hitpoints, and attacks with both Melee and Ranged. The creature has four forms which it transitions through during the fight after taking a set amount of damage:\n{| class=\"wikitable align-center-1 align-center-2 align-center-3 align-center-4 align-center-6\"\n|+Carapace colours\n!Colour\n!Attacks\n!Pray against\n!Player attack\n!Tactic\n!Max hit\n|-\n|Brown\n[[File:Strange Creature (melee).png|frameless|width=150x150]]\n|Melee only\n[[File:Attack icon (detail).png|frameless|width=30x30]]\n|Melee\n[[File:Protect from Melee.png|frameless]]\n|Magic[[File:Magic icon (detail).png|frameless|width=30x30]]\nor\nRanged[[File:Ranged icon (detail).png|frameless|width=30x30]]\n|Keep a distance and '''attack with Magic or Ranged'''. Be prepared to '''Protect from Melee''' if you accidentally get too close to the creature, but be advised that this will only partially reduce damage. Ensure that you bring several [[stamina potion]]s.\n\nFor those with access to good gear, Magic is advisable, as the creature has reduced Magic defence during this phase. If using Magic and Ranged, a switch of gear may be beneficial here to improve your chances of hitting the creature. Freezing it with [[ice spells]] is also viable during this phase, but note that freezes are 25% less effective than normal, meaning it will only stay frozen for 75% of the base freeze duration of ice spells.\n\nWhile the Creature has reduced magic defence during this phase, it still has a Magic level of 150, making splashes quite frequent. Players without max gear or a high Magic level may find it more viable to remain ranging this phase, using the special effect of [[ruby bolts (e)]] to rapidly lower its health and end the phase quickly.\n\n'''Note:''' During this phase, the creature has +160 Ranged Defence, so equipment with high Ranged attack bonuses are recommended if ranging.\n|24\n|-\n|Green\n[[File:Strange Creature (ranged).png|frameless|width=151x151]]\n|Magic[[File:Magic icon (detail).png|frameless|width=30x30]]\nRanged[[File:Ranged icon (detail).png|frameless|width=30x30]]\n|Ranged\n[[File:Protect from Missiles.png|frameless]]\n|Ranged \n[[File:Ranged icon (detail).png|frameless|width=30x30]]\n|'''Attack with Ranged''' and have your prayer book open. Be prepared to '''Protect from Magic''' if necessary, and switch back to range after. No running is necessary for this phase; additionally, the correct protection prayers will negate all damage.\n|33\n|-\n|Teal (Prayer shield)\n[[File:Strange Creature (shielded).png|frameless|width=150x150]]\n|Magic[[File:Magic icon (detail).png|frameless|width=30x30]]\nRanged[[File:Ranged icon (detail).png|frameless|width=30x30]]\n|Ranged\n[[File:Protect from Missiles.png|frameless]]\n|Ranged\n[[File:Ranged icon (detail).png|frameless|width=30x30]]\n|As soon as the Creature teleports to the centre of the room, '''run behind nearby spikes''' to avoid its shockwave. Attack the same as during the green phase, <u>'''always'''</u> praying against magic when necessary. When the shield appears, switch to [[Smite]] during attacks if possible; the shield will slowly disappear on its own, but Smite speeds up this process dramatically. It is also advised to use [[sapphire bolts (e)]] if using a crossbow for this phase, as it has a chance of draining a majority of the creature's prayer shield. \n\nThis form only appears once, when the creature is at 20% health. Damage received by the player during this phase will partially heal the creature after the shield is drained.\n|38\n|-\n|Green (post-shield)\n|Magic[[File:Magic icon (detail).png|frameless|width=30x30]]\nRanged[[File:Ranged icon (detail).png|frameless|width=30x30]]\n|Ranged\n[[File:Protect from Missiles.png|frameless]]\n|Ranged\n[[File:Ranged icon (detail).png|frameless|width=30x30]]\n|'''Attack with Ranged''', with your prayer book open, prepared to '''Protect from Magic''' if necessary.\n'''Note:''' During this phase, change of attack styles becomes more frequent, spikes spawn in numerous towards the whole map.  \n|38\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable align-center-3 align-center-4\"\n|+Additional attacks\n!Animation\n!Attack\n!Pray against\n!Max hit\n|-\n|Raising arms and charging purple energy\n|Strong magic attack that if not blocked will inflict prayer-draining [[Corruption (status)|corruption]].\n|Magic\n|33\n|-\n|Slamming spikes into the ground\n|Spikes that damage the player and heal the creature.

He then notices you and attempts to question you, but before anything can happen, the assassin appears and casts a spell on Jhallan, teleporting him away, and disappearing again.\n\nYou will report what happened to Hazeel and Khazard, just as the strange barrier dissipates, unsealing the prison. They will realise the assassin is capable of entering the [[Shadow Realm]]. Khazard will leave behind a regiment of troops to secure the area, and Hazeel will offer you a teleport back to East Ardougne. Accept the teleport, and report back to the guard to complete the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Secrets of the North\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Agility|60,000|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Thieving|50,000|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Hunter|40,000|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n* Ability to mine [[ancient essence crystals]] in the [[Ghorrock Dungeon]]\n* Access to a stronger version of the [[Strange Creature]], the [[Phantom Muspah]]\n}}\n\n\n==Required for completing==\n* [[Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Unlock details\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Music track\n|-\n|[[Secrets of the North (music track)|Secrets of the North]]\n|Unlocked upon entering the [[Ghorrock Dungeon]]\n|[[File:Secrets of the North.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[In the Shadows]]\n|Unlocked during the fight with the [[assassin]]\n|[[File:In the Shadows.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[More Than Meets the Eye]]\n|Unlocked during the fight with the [[Strange Creature]]\n|[[File:More Than Meets the Eye.ogg]]\n|}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The equivalent of this quest in ''RuneScape'' is {{RSL|The Tale of the Muspah}}, though there are substantial story changes owing to the differences in the two games' Mahjarrat quest lines.\n* The quest was first pitched as a nameless master-level quest, with vague details about the plot, the quest boss, and its rewards for defeating it post-quest, whose names were changed to keep the Zarosian nature of the rewards a secret. The true name of the quest and its rewards from the boss were later revealed in the [[Winter Summit 2022]] a month later.\n* At the end of many [[Quests/Series|Mahjarrat quests]], the importance of the north is mentioned via the many [[Mahjarrat]] telling the player or other that they \"will meet again in the north\".\n\n{{Secrets of the North}}"

Alternatively if you have access to [[Fairy rings]], taking the ring with code {{Fairycode|bkr}} and running to the boat at [[The Hollows]] will be your second quickest option. If you are 50 [[Agility]] or higher, take the ring with code {{Fairycode|bip}} and use the hopping stone to the swamp. Players who have completed the hard Morytania diary can teleport to Burgh de Rott using Morytania Legs 3 and running north. Another option is to use a Barrows teleport tablet, then run west.\n\nIn the absence of the above three methods; to get to Mort'ton, head west out of [[Canifis]] until you see a [[Farming/Patch locations|farming patch]]. Head south-west through the gate to get to [[Mort Myre Swamp]]. From here, head west to the river, and simply hug it, proceeding south until you hit a bridge. Simply follow the path until you hit Mort'ton, ignoring the two dead ends along the way. '''Note:''' '''You must start [[Nature Spirit]] to access the gate leading to Mort Myre Swamp.''' \n\n===Starting the quest===\nIn order to start Shades of Mort'ton, you must head to the most south-western house in Mort'ton and search the shelf on the wall to find a [[Diary (Shades of Mort'ton)|book]]. '''You should also search the [[smashed table (Mort'ton)|smashed table]], as it contains two [[Tarromin]] and [[Rogue's purse]].''' The Tarromin will allow you to create additional potions later on, so hang onto those. The Rogue's purse is not used in this quest, and can safely be dropped (Save the Rogue's purse if you plan to do [[Zogre Flesh Eaters]]). This building also contains a vial spawn in case you didn't bring vials of water with you. You can fill the vials in the sink in the easternmost building.\n\n===Serum 207 and killing shades===\n'''''Items required:''' 300+ [[coins]], [[vial of water]], [[tarromin]], [[ashes]], [[food]], [[armour]], and a [[weapon]].''\n\nReading the book will now allow you to create [[Serum 207]], a combination of a water-filled [[vial]], [[tarromin]] and [[ashes]]. Using Serum 207 on the afflicted in town (those with specific names) will allow you to speak with them '''momentarily'''. Having multiple sets of the ingredients will allow you to create more potions if necessary, so it is recommended to bring multiple sets. Serum 207 may be traded, but you must make at least one yourself in order to use it for the purposes of the quest.\n\nMake a Serum 207 (add ashes to a [[Tarromin potion (unf)]]), and use it on [[Razmire Keelgan]] in the [[general store]]. Razmire will ask you to kill 5 [[Loar Shade]]s (the level 40 green shadows) and collect their [[Loar remains|remains]]. You must talk to Razmire '''before''' you kill five shades otherwise they will not count towards the requirement. You must also kill the five shades yourself, you '''cannot''' buy five remains off another player. When you're done (there will be a notice in the chat: \"That's all five Shades!\"), return and use the Serum 207 on Razmire again, and he will take two of the shade remains from you.\n\nOpen the general store through Razmire and buy some [[olive oil]]. Then ask him to open the builders store, and buy at least one [[timber beam]], one [[limestone brick]], and five [[swamp paste]] per timber/limestone.\n\nNow, proceed to [[Ulsquire Shauncy]]. He can be found in the house to the south-east, marked on the minimap as containing a water source. Give him a dose of Serum 207, and then one of your [[shade remains]]. Talk to him again, and ask what he learned about them; he will joke about rebuilding the temple and experimenting with the sacred flame. Also, ask him what can he tell you about the temple, which is located north-east of the general store, on a small island. '''<u>Note</u>:''' '''Make sure to go through all talk options with Ulsquire (1, 2, 3, 4 in the chat options); failure to do so will result in not being able to interact at all with the temple (the minigame stats *Temple Repair* Repair State ___% Resources __% Sanctity __% will not even appear in the upper right corner of your screen. Interacting with the temple results in a message \"You're not quite sure how to fix this\" and you'll only see in your quest journal, \"Ulsquire seems to know a lot about this area, maybe by exploring the local area I will be able to help the locals\").'''\n\n===Repairing the Temple===\n'''''Items required:'''''\n* [[Hammer]] or [[Flamtaer hammer]], [[food]], [[armour]], [[Weapons|weapon]], [[tinderbox]], ''[[axe]], [[loar remains]],'' [[olive oil]], and 1+ [[Serum 207|doses of Serum 207]] (2+ recommended). A [[Flamtaer hammer]] and a few [[Flamtaer bracelet]]s are recommended.\n* Building materials: Multiples of [[limestone brick]], [[timber beam]], 5 [[swamp paste]] (the swamp paste stacks.)\n\nNow, you must rebuild the temple in order to create the sacred oil needed for a pyre funeral. See [[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)]] for more details of how this works.\n\nA [[Flamtaer bracelet]] along with the [[Flamtaer hammer]] will allow you to build the temple <u>on your own</u>. It is recommended to bring at least two or three bracelets to build the temple if attempting this solo. A higher [[Crafting]] level will also increase the speed of building and repairing the temple.\n\nWorld 377 is a dedicated world for rebuilding the temple if you're looking for assistance. This part of the quest can be finished much quicker when there are multiple players building the temple. Five or six players, with two or three building the walls and the rest distracting shades from destroying the walls should make for a successful build within a few minutes.\n\nUsing the [[Grouping]] interface, or doing the quest with friends are possible ways to find other players who can help repair the temple. Peak activity at the [[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton]] minigame is typically between 12:00 pm and 3:00 pm EST (4:00 pm to 7:00 pm GMT). It may be difficult to find other players using the Grouping interface outside of these times.\n\nWhile defending/repairing the temple, you will receive a gradually increasing percentage of '''Sanctity'''. Sanctity is earned by killing [[Loar Shade]]s or using your building materials to build/repair pieces of the temple.\n\nIn order to progress the quest, ignite the flame once the temple has been built and combine the [[olive oil]] with the sacred flame to create [[sacred oil]]. You will need 10% Sanctity to do this, which should be easily obtained during the temple build.\n\nIf you wish to cure the [[afflicted]] citizens of the town permanently (useful for the general store), use a vial of [[Serum 207]] on the sacred flame with 20% Sanctity to create [[Serum 208]]. It is strongly recommended to use a dose of Serum 208 on both [[Razmire]] and [[Ulsquire]] to cure their affliction permanently.\n\n'''Tip:''' To sanctify both [[olive oil]] and [[Serum 207]], get over 20% sanctity, sanctify the [[olive oil]] first then the [[Serum 207]], as the latter consumes 20% of sanctity regardless of number of doses, whereas olive oil uses up 0.9% per dose.\n\n===Burning a Shade===\n[[File:Shades of Mort'ton - Burning shade remains.gif|frame|right|The Shade spirit is now free!]]\n'''''Items required:''' [[Sacred oil]], [[axe]], [[loar remains]], [[tinderbox]]''.\n\nAfter you obtain the sacred oil, cut down a [[dead tree]], and use sacred oil on the [[logs]] to receive a [[pyre logs|pyre log]]. Then, head over to one of the funeral pyres, which are the brown patches on the map west of the General Store. Use the pyre logs on the funeral pyre, followed by the [[Loar remains]]. Light this and you will see a spirit rise from the pyre.\n\nCollect your reward from the stone pillar next to the pyre and head back to Ulsquire. Speak with him to prompt the end of the quest (use a serum if he has reverted to being afflicted).\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n{{clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Shades of Mort'ton\n|image = [[File:Shades of Mort'ton reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 3\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Herblore|2,000}} [[Herblore]] experience\n*{{SCP|Crafting|2,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*Ability to play the [[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton minigame]]\n*Ability to use the Shades of Mort'ton [[minigame teleport]]\n*Bonus: If you take the [[Diary (Shades of Mort'ton)|Diary of Herbi Flax]] to the [[Apothecary]] in [[Varrock]], you'll get an extra 335 [[Herblore]] experience (can only be done once).\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|daterange = 26 January -<br/>25 June 2005\n|update = \n|change = The quest was renamed from \"Shades of Mortton\" to \"Shades of Mort'ton\".\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n{{Shades of Mort'ton}}"

It begins with the revelation that some sheep have been infected with plague. The target of the quest is to herd the sick sheep, kill them and dispose of their remains to prevent the plague from spreading to the town. Herding the sheep can prove challenging, since they are not very cooperative.\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Councillor Halgrive]] outside of the [[East Ardougne]] church.\n|startmap = 2617,3299\n|difficulty = Novice\n|description = Dispose of plagued sheep and save Ardougne!\n|length = Short\n|items = * 100 [[coins]]\n|recommended = * [[Energy restoring items]]\n*[[Ardougne Teleport]] for access to beginning of quest.\n*[[Skills Necklace]] or other teleport near fishing guild\n|leagueRegion = <poem>\n{{RE|Kandarin}} — location requirement\nUnlocking {{RE|Tirannwn}} {{okay}} will auto-complete the quest\n</poem>\n}}\n\n==Walkthrough==\n===A threat to public health and safety===\n{{Needed|100 [[coins]]}}\n{{Map|x=2617|y=3299|r=3|mtype=square|align=right|caption=The quest's start point.|width=250|height=250}}\n\nSpeak to [[Councillor Halgrive]] located in [[East Ardougne]] in the graveyard directly south of the church.\n\nHe is concerned about [[Sick-looking sheep|plagued sheep]] located near East Ardougne that escaped from a local farm, causing a threat to the health and safety for the public. He is looking for someone to herd the sheep, kill them quickly and cleanly, and dispose the remains in a special [[incinerator (Sheep Herder)|incinerator]] set up by [[Farmer Brumty]].\n\nAgree to help do the job. He will happily thank you and mention you need a [[plague suit]] while herding the sheep. He will tell you to pick up the plague suit from [[Doctor Orbon]] and hand you some poisoned [[sheep feed]].\n\nHead inside the church and talk to Doctor Orbon. After explaining you need protective clothing to dispose the escaped infected sheep, he will sell his last suit for 100 [[coins]] so he can afford a replacement for himself. Agree to pay for the suit, and you should receive a plague jacket and plague trousers. Pray with missing [[Prayer points]] at the [[altar]] to complete an easy task in the [[Ardougne diary]].\n\n===Herding the sheep===\n{{Needed|[[Plague jacket]], [[plague trousers]]}}\n{{Map|align=right|mtype=pin|caption=Location of the sheep.\n|2609,3389,title:Location of the yellow sheep,icon:yellowPin,desc:\n|2620,3368,title:Location of the green sheep,icon:greenPin,desc:\n|2608,3346,title:Location of the red sheep,icon:redPin,desc:\n|2569,3383,title:Location of the blue sheep,icon:bluePin,desc:\n}}\nHead to the fenced in enclosure located north-west of the north bank in [[East Ardougne]]. With your [[plague suit]] equipped, enter the gate on the west side of the enclosure. Head towards the incinerator where you will find a [[cattleprod]] lying on the ground a few steps south of the incinerator. Pick it up. \n\nLeave the fenced in enclosure using the west gate. You can begin to dispose of the sheep by equipping the cattleprod and using it to direct the sheep into the fenced in enclosure using the west gate. The sheep will be prodded in the direction of which you are facing. The sheep can return back to their initial locations if you wait too long to prod. '''You only need one of each colour (in any order)''', and you can finish one sheep at a time.\n\nNote: You can have a friend join you and body block the sheep, preventing them from going farther than desired and also prevent them from going back to their original location. \n\n*Red sheep are located north of the north bank in East Ardougne.\n*Green sheep are north-east of the red sheep, directly north of a fenced in area with chopped and fallen trees.\n*Blue sheep are located north-west of the fenced in enclosure with the incinerator, nearby a small camp with [[Warrior (Thieving)|warriors]]. Do not go too far, as there are also aggressive level 42 [[moss giant]]s nearby.\n*Yellow sheep are located south of the [[Fishing Guild]].\n\nNote: If a sheep goes '''''BAAAAA!''''' (uppercase letters), it will be prodded in the direction you direct them towards. If a sheep goes '''''Baa''''', it will return to its initial location. When directing them to the fenced in pen with the incinerator located, it is better to spam click the sheep so that it does not walk back. The sheep can get stuck if you prod them into a corner or against a wall where you cannot prod them another direction. Wait until the sheep goes '''''Baa''''' and moves towards its initial location.\n[[File:Sheep Herder - Sheep.png|thumb|All four sheep in the pen.]]\n\n===Killing the plagued sheep===\n{{Needed|[[Plague jacket]], [[plague trousers]], [[Sheep feed|poisoned sheep food]]}}\n\nOnce you have directed them to the gate of the incinerator, the sheep will automatically go inside the gate. Use the [[Sheep feed|poisoned sheep food]] to kill each sheep. Collect their bones and use them on the incinerator to burn the remains.\n\nReturn to [[Councillor Halgrive]] and tell him you disposed of the four sheep.

In it, players help [[Fred the Farmer]] shear his [[sheep]].\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Fred the Farmer]] in the house by the [[sheep]] pen north of [[Lumbridge Castle]].\n|startmap = 3189,3273\n|difficulty = Novice\n|description = Fred the Farmer's sheep are getting mighty woolly.

New players are encouraged to follow the steps below to explore different parts of the town; however, collecting and spinning the wool are optional, as the balls of wool are tradeable between players and sold in stores. The fastest way to complete the quest is to simply buy 20 balls of wool from the [[Grand Exchange]] and then give them to Fred.{{Map|x=3189|y=3274|r=4|mtype=square|caption=Fred the Farmer's location.|align=right|width=250|height=250}}\n==Walkthrough==\n[[File:Fred the Farmer chathead.png|left|frameless|width=100x100]]\nSpeak to [[Fred the Farmer]] at his sheep farm, found slightly north of the [[Lumbridge Castle]]. Ask about a quest, and he will task you with bringing him 20 [[balls of wool]].  \n\n===Obtaining the wool===\n[[File:Lumbridge Sheep chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nIf you do not have [[shears]], Fred will give you some. Enter the fenced area containing [[sheep]], connected to the east side of his house.\n[[File:Sheep Shearer - Spinning wheel.png|thumb|The [[spinning wheel]] on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of [[Lumbridge Castle]].]]\nShear the sheep, either by selecting the \"shear\" option on the sheep, or right-clicking the shears and selecting \"use,\" then clicking the sheep to use the shears on them directly. Sheep with wool will look puffy, and sheep without wool will look skinny; you will need to shear the puffy ones twenty times. If none are available simply wait, as they will grow back their wool after one minute. Sometimes they will run away from you if you try to shear them; keep trying and eventually you will get them.\n\nWatch out for rams during this part of the quest. They look very similar to [[sheep]], but left-clicking attacks them; they cannot be sheared, only fought. Rams have horns and sheep do not.\n\n[[Fred the Farmer]] will warn you about \"[[Sheep (penguins)|The Thing]]\" and tells you to be wary of it while in the sheep pen; it is actually two [[penguin]]s in a disguise, from the [[Cold War]] [[quest]], located by being the only sheep with an option to talk to it. Attempting to shear \"the Thing\" makes the penguins squeak and run from you. There is no danger from it during the quest.[[File:Sheep Shearer - Abnormal sheep.png|thumb|The two [[penguin]]s disguised as a [[sheep]].]]\n=== Spinning the wool ===\nOnce you have 20 pieces of [[wool]], you now need to spin them into balls of wool. Go to the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the [[Lumbridge Castle]], and find the bedroom on the south end of the castle. Inside is a [[spinning wheel]]; click on the wheel with the wool in your [[inventory]] to spin your wool into balls. When they are all spun, go back to Fred the Farmer to finish the quest. If you do not have the space to carry all 20 pieces of wool, you can make smaller deliveries until you reach the required total.\n\nPlayers planning to do more [[free-to-play]] quests right after this one are advised to shear and spin at least three more [[ball of wool|balls of wool]], for use in [[Prince Ali Rescue]].\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Reward==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Sheep Shearer\n|image = [[File:Sheep Shearer reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*{{SCP|Crafting|150}} [[Crafting]] [[experience]]\n*60 [[coins]]\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*This quest, along with [[Cook's Assistant]], [[Doric's Quest]], and [[Imp Catcher]], are the fastest possible quests to complete in the game (provided you are carrying the required items in your [[inventory]] at the start).\n* Sheep Shearer is the oldest quest in ''RuneScape'', having existed, albeit incomplete, in ''[[rsw:DeviousMUD|DeviousMUD]]''.\n\n{{Sheep Shearer}}"

However, the crossbows must be traded to a Black Arm gang member in order to gain trust to Katrine.\n*If collecting crossbows, they can respawn three times before the [[weaponsmaster]] does.\n*Additional certificate halves can be obtained by speaking to the curator provided the player has turned in a shield half prior and has not finished the quest nor in possession of a full certificate. The halves received will be the same as the one's received before. There is no practical limit to how many certificate halves you can have. '''Note: Once you finish the quest, or are in possession of a full certificate, you can no longer get spare shields or speak to the curator for additional certificate halves.''' However, you can continue to keep certificate halves in your bank account indefinitely after you have completed the quest or trade for them with other players.\n*New player trade restrictions apply to quest items but it is still possible to trade the items by using them on the other player.\n*The player who joined the Phoenix Gang will receive 2 left halves, and the player who joined the Black Arm Gang will receive 2 right halves.\n\n*You can get multiple  certificates by talking to Haig Museum Curator*\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 29 May 2007\n|update = Varrock's New Look\n|change = The quest was updated with the redesign of Varrock. Before this update, to finish the quest, one of the players would need to give their partner their half of the shield. The person with both halves would then hand them in to the Curator, and get two certificates in return. They would then have to give one of the two certificates to the partner to finish the quest.<br/>\nAfter this update, a system that mitigates any element of trust was implemented, where shield halves can be handed in for certificate halves, which can then be exchanged in a single trade.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Shield of Arrav was one of the 6 quests available during ''RuneScape''{{'}}s launch.\n*Once a player finishes the quest, they can no longer take any halves of the shield from their storage places. However, players can still acquire the halves of the shield from other players (via trading, drops, or general stores).\n*In the beginning, a bug allowed the player to join both gangs. Katrine would appear angry at the player, but the player would still be able to enter the Black Arm Gang. The Phoenix gang doorman would also attack the player.\n*In the early days, entering the Phoenix Gang's headquarters required a separate key. This was later changed, and the key was removed from the game.\n*The shield is currently on display (display number 24) at the [[Varrock museum|Varrock Museum]] after you speak to the curator on the second floor and tell him how you recovered the shield for the museum.\n*Before the shield is put onto display in the [[Varrock museum|Varrock Museum]], it mentions \"King Roald has offered a 1,200 coins bounty for the reward of the shield and we keep this display case empty in the hopes it will one day be returned.\" However, King Roald rewards the adventurer only 600 coins for quest completion - half of the advertised offer from the display case. During the final dialogue it is mentioned that this is due to the fact that your partner gets the other half.\n*Although it's possible to start the quest with a complete certificate, attempting to turn it in to King Roald yields him saying, \"The name on this certificate isn't yours! I can't give you the reward unless you do the quest yourself!\"\n*It is possible to \"start\" the quest multiple times by starting the quest with Reldo and then asking Charlie the Tramp about the alleyway, or by repeatedly asking Charlie the Tramp about the alleyway. When doing this, the \"Start the Shield of Arrav quest?\" prompt will appear each time Charlie the Tramp talks about the Black Arm Gang, although this will not reset any progress the player has made in the quest.\n\n{{Shield of Arrav}}"

If you have access to the [[fairy ring]] network, you may travel to south of Tai Bwo Wannai Village ({{Fairycode|CKR}}) and run south across the bridge, then east on the path behind Shilo Village.\n\nSelect the following five options:\n\n#''\"Why do I need to run?\"'' {{Chat option|1}}\n#''\"Rashiliyia?

Use the wampum belt on Trufitus, and he will tell you that things look very bleak {{Chat option|2|2|1|3|1}}Ask him about a legend and the temple, and tell him to tell you more. He will have almost no hope of anyone finding the temple of [[Ah Za Rhoon]]. You must state that you will look for the temple, and once you affirm your intent to search, [[Trufitus]] will take the wampum belt from you, and this [[quest]] will turn yellow in your [[Quest Journal]].\n\n:\n\n===Ah Za Rhoon===\n{{Map|x=2922|y=3000|r=4|mtype=square|align=right|caption=Location of Ah Za Rhoon}}\n'''''Items required:''' [[Spade]], lit [[Torch]] or [[candle]], [[rope]], [[chisel]] or [[pickaxe]], 2 free inventory spaces.\n\n'''''Items recommended:''' Decent [[armour]] and/or [[Prayer potion]]s to defend against the [[undead one]]s, food.'' \n\nTo get to the temple of Ah Za Rhoon from [[Tai Bwo Wannai]], go east to the river, cross the log near the crashed [[glider]], and go south along the river until you reach a mound of earth surrounded by rocks. If you have completed [[The Grand Tree]], a quicker way to get there is to use a [[ring of dueling]] to teleport to the [[Emir's Arena]] (Al Kharid PvP Arena), walk to the glider in [[Al Kharid]], and take a glider to Gandius.\n\n*Use your [[spade]] on the [[Mound of earth|mound of earth]] to find a fissure.\n*Use your [[torch]] or [[candle]] on the fissure to light it up (it will drop down and you will not be able to get it back).\n*Add a [[rope]] to the fissure.\n*Search the fissure and climb down into the dungeon below (requiring 32 [[Agility]]). \n\n:'''Note:''' If you wait too long before climbing down, the dirt mound will respawn and cover the entry. You don't need another torch and rope to open it back up, just right click and search it twice to resume the quest.\n\nIn the cave are [[undead one]]s (level 61 - 73) who may attack you. Killing them occasionally causes a cloud of [[poison gas]] to appear and deal damage to you.\n\nIn this cave system, you will need to find four items. Consult the following map to aid in finding them.\n\n{| align=center\n|-\n|colspan=2 | [[File:Ah Za Rhoon map.png|center]]\n|-\n| '''1''' - Entrance || '''5''' - Waterfall rocks\n|-\n| '''2''' - Cave-in || '''6''' - Loose rocks\n|-\n| '''3''' - Smashed table || '''7''' - Sacks\n|-\n| '''4''' - Strange looking stone || '''8''' - Gallows\n|}\n\n*Start off by heading south until you see the water. \n*Use a [[chisel]] or a [[pickaxe]] on the strange-looking stone (4 on the map; it is a small grey stone in the floor to the east of a [[Smashed chair]] and south of a stalagmite) to obtain the [[stone-plaque]].\n*Go west past the column and search the [[Cave in]] (2 on the map) to crawl through and into some ruins.\n*Head north until you reach the end of the ruined buildings. Search the [[loose rocks]] (6 on the map) near the north-west wall to find the [[tattered scroll]]. If you fail, you will get hit for 4-7 (possibly more) damage. \n*Now head south-east until you come to a small dead-end branch. Search the sacks next to a smashed table (7 on the map) to obtain the [[crumpled scroll]]. \n*Finally, head north to the far end of the cavern, where you will find the ancient gallows (8 on the map). Search it and remove the corpse to obtain the [[Zadimus corpse]].\n[[File:Shilo Village - Boat ride.png|thumb|250px|Taking the boat out of [[Ah Za Rhoon]].]]\nAfter acquiring all four items, you can teleport out. Otherwise, to exit the dungeon, return to the smashed table (3 on the map). You can craft the smashed table into a raft and use it to leave. This does not always work; it is possible to get the message that there isn't enough wood left. In this case, you will have to leave by other means. If you want, you can continue south, then east to the end of the cave. Search the rocks you find there to leave via the waterfall. You will take a lot of damage if you fall while leaving this way. You will find yourself near the stepping stones to the east of [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]].\n\n'''Note:''' If you decide to exit through the waterfall, before exiting turn on protect from melee to not take damage from the waterfall. (Tested 11/8/2024, Protect From Melee does not negate damage, took ~20 damage with prayer on)\n\n===Scrolls from Ah Za Rhoon and the proper burial===\n[[File:Shilo Village - Burying Zadimus corpse.png|thumb|250px|Zadimus' corpse is buried.]]\nRead both the scrolls and the plaque. Next, use both scrolls, the plaque, and the corpse on [[Trufitus]]. He will tell you about the tomb of Bervirius and instruct you to bury the corpse. \n\nGo to the [[Tribal Statue]] west of Trufitus' hut, and bury the [[Zadimus corpse]]. The [[Spirit of Zadimus]] will appear. He will give you a [[Bone shard (Shilo Village)|bone shard]]. Take the bone shard back to Trufitus, and he'll tell you to look for [[Tomb of Bervirius|Bervirius' tomb]].\n\n:'''Note:''' Be sure to read the scrolls and the plaque, or Trufitus won't tell you about Bervirius' tomb! Also, don't worry about the quest guide not updating too much. Once you've got all the items, you should be fine to go to Bervirius' tomb.\n\n===Tomb of Bervirius===\n'''''Items required:''' [[bronze wire]], A [[chisel]], 3 free inventory spaces''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' food (for lower agility levels)''\n[[File:Tomb of Bervirius.png|thumb|250px|The Tomb of Bervirius.]]\nFrom [[Tai Bwo Wannai]], go south past the [[Graahk]] [[hunting]] area, towards [[Cairn Isle]]. \n\nClimb the rocks and cross the bridge to reach [[Cairn Isle]]. At lower [[Agility]] levels, you have a higher chance of falling and taking damage, so it may be wise to bring some food.\n\nOnce you're across the bridge, search the well-stacked rocks (i.e. the cairn) on the north side of the island. Enter the crawl-way (32 Agility needed) to enter the [[Tomb of Bervirius]]. You may become stuck many times, but keep trying. \n\nHead south to the [[tomb dolmen (Tomb of Bervirius)|dolmen]], and search it to get a [[sword pommel]], a [[locating crystal]], and [[Bervirius notes]] (if you lose these items, you will need [[charcoal]] and [[papyrus]] to get the Bervirius notes again).\n\nRead the scrolls. You need to make a new necklace. Use a [[chisel]] on the sword pommel to make [[bone beads]]. Use the [[bronze wire]] on the beads to make the [[beads of the dead]] necklace.\n\nExit the cave by climbing the rock slide north of the dolmen, or teleport out. \n[[File:Tomb of Bervirius map.png|center|thumb|200px|Map of the Tomb]]\n\n:'''Note:''' If you drop the sword pommel or the bone beads, they will turn to dust and you will have to go back and get new ones. IF you drop the locating crystal, you will take 10 damage.\n\n===Tomb of Rashiliyia===\n'''''Items needed:''' [[Chisel]], [[Bone shard (Shilo Village)|bone shard]], [[beads of the dead]] necklace, [[locating crystal]], 3 regular [[bones|bones.]]''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' Good [[food]] ([[lobsters]] or higher), [[weapon]], good [[armour]]. An emergency [[teleport]] for low level players.''\n\n:'''Tip:''' If you have access to the [[fairy ring]] network, you can use the karambwan [[fishing spot]] fairy ring ({{Fairycode|DKP}}) to travel just north of the [[Rashiliyia's Tomb|Tomb of Rashiliyia]] entrance.\n:\n\n'''From the fairy ring''' ({{Fairycode|DKP}}): Head south until you're about halfway between the coast and crashed glider. \n\n'''From [[Trufitus]]:''' Head east and follow the river southward until you come to the log near the crashed glider. Cross the log. \n\n[[Rashiliyia's Tomb]] is north of the crashed [[gnome glider]]. Look for a searchable [[palm tree (Shilo Village)|palm tree]]. It should be noted that the entrance is hidden behind a hill and is most visible if you are facing south. [[File:Shilo Village - Tomb of Rashiliyia entrance.png|thumb|The hidden doors to the Tomb of Rashiliyia.]]Search the palm trees to find two [[carved doors|doors]]. Search these doors to find the shape of the keyhole, and then use your [[chisel]] on the [[Bone shard (Shilo Village)|bone shard]] to make a [[bone key (Shilo Village)|bone key]]. Put on the [[beads of the dead]] necklace, and then use the key on the door to enter.(If you don't put the necklace on you cannot get through the gate in the first room and will take constant damage.)\n\n'''Note:''' You might run into [[The Shaikahan]] (level 83), which cannot be damaged with regular weapons.\n\n'''Note:''' If you are low level, bring a friend and let them tank the zombies. If nobody can help you, then suicide-run to the door until you manage to use all 3 bones on it. Once you've done that, you can open the door and the creatures won't be able to attack you.\n\n'''Note:''' If you attempt to leave the entrance area by clicking on the tomb door the player will say a few lines of dialogue, causing any damage done to the player to stack once the dialogue ends. This can kill low level players as the summoned undead ones can hit up to 7 damage.\n\n{|align=center\n|-\n|colspan=2 | [[File:Rashiliyia's Tomb map.png]]\n|-\n| '''1''' - Entrance || '''3''' - Skeleton door\n|-\n| '''2''' - Rock slope || '''4''' - Dolmen\n|}\n\nOnce inside, run past the [[undead ones]] and through the ancient gates, then head down the rock slope. Go west until you find a stack of coins ('''do not''' pick them up), then south, and then south-west at the first fork. At the end of this corridor will be a set of [[tomb doors|doors]]. Other sets of dummy doors exist if you take a wrong turn, so make sure you're in the right place. '''Right-click''' the [[bones]] to use them on the door. While still wearing the necklace, enter the room. If for any reason you leave this room, you will '''not''' need bones to enter the room again.\n\n:'''Note:''' If you try to pick up the coins, the coins will turn to dust and more undead ones will be summoned.\n\n===Nazastarool===\n[[File:Nazastarool safespot.png|thumb|220px|Lure Nazastarool to the northern part of the dolmen to safespot him.]]While still wearing the [[beads of the dead]], search the [[tomb dolmen (Rashiliyia's Tomb)|dolmen]] in the room. You will be attacked by [[Nazastarool]], a level 91 [[zombie]]. He uses [[Melee]] throughout the battle. After you defeat him, he will turn into a level 68 [[skeleton]]. After you defeat him, he'll turn into a level 93 [[ghost]]. You can [[safespot]] all three forms from any side of the dolmen. You can kill each form separately, leave to restock, and then return to kill the next form.\n\nOnce you have defeated the ghost, you will get the [[Rashiliyia corpse|corpse of Rashiliyia]].\n\n:'''Tip:''' Between forms, a dialogue comes in the conversation window. In extremis, perform some other action, like burying the spare bones you brought, or inspecting your quest log, and the next incarnation will not immediately appear, giving you time to heal, leave, etc.\n:'''Note:''' All three forms can be flinched using the safespot pictured to the right. Beware of the 5 minute despawn timer if using this method. \n:'''Note:''' A friend can help you slay the boss. You only need to be the last player to attack it (this counts 0s but not poison/venom), you do not need to deal any damage yourself. It is also possible to defeat the boss with a cannon.\n:Note: Each form has a 5 minute despawn timer if the boss is not killed fast enough.\n:\n\nTo leave, simply return to where you entered. Use your key on the door to exit. It is recommended for lower level players to instead teleport out. \n\n:\n\n===Rashiliyia's corpse===\n:'''Tip:''' If you have access to the [[fairy ring]] network, you can use the fairy ring north-west of the exit of the [[Rashiliyia's Tomb|Tomb of Rashiliyia]] to teleport to Cairn Isle ({{Fairycode|CKR}}).\n\nGo back to the [[tomb of Bervirius]] on [[Cairn Isle]] west from [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]], and use [[Rashiliyia corpse|Rashiliyia's remains]] on the dolmen.

To avenge his brother and eradicate the Myreque once and for all.\n|length = Long\n|requirements = *Completion of the following quests:\n**[[Vampyre Slayer]]\n**[[A Taste of Hope]]\n***[[Darkness of Hallowvale]]\n****[[In Aid of the Myreque]]\n*****[[In Search of the Myreque]]\n******[[Nature Spirit]]\n*******[[Priest in Peril]]\n*******[[The Restless Ghost]]\n*{{SCP|Woodcutting|62|link=yes}} {{Boostable|no}} {{Questreqstart|yes}}\n*{{SCP|Fletching|60|link=yes}} {{Boostable|no}} {{Questreqstart|yes}}\n*{{SCP|Crafting|56|link=yes}} {{Boostable|no}} {{Questreqstart|yes}}\n*{{SCP|Agility|52|link=yes}} {{Boostable|no}} {{Questreqstart|}}\n*{{SCP|Attack|50|link=yes}} {{Boostable|no}} {{Questreqstart|}}\n*{{SCP|Slayer|50|link=yes}} {{Boostable|no}} {{Questreqstart|}}\n*{{SCP|Magic|49|link=yes}} {{Boostable|no}} {{Questreqstart|}}\n|items = *Any [[axe]]\n*[[Vyrewatch outfit]] ([[Vyrewatch top|top]], [[Vyrewatch legs|legs]], and [[Vyrewatch shoes|shoes]]) or 1,950 coins to purchase it from [[Trader Sven's Black-market Goods]] (can be obtained during quest)\n*[[Ivandis flail]]\n*[[Ruby]]\n*[[Knife]] (can be obtained during quest)\n*[[Chisel]]\n*Runes for [[Lvl-3 Enchant]] (1 [[cosmic rune]], 5 [[fire rune]]s) or an [[enchant ruby or topaz]] tablet\n|kills = *[[Kroy]] (level 133)\n*[[Nail beast]] (level 143 & 67 twice)\n*[[Vampyre Juvinate#Level 119|Vampyre Juvinate]] (level 119) twice\n*[[Mutated Bloodveld]] (level 123)\n*[[Damien Leucurte]] (level 204)\n*[[Vampyre Juvenile]] (level 122)\n*[[Vanstrom Klause]] (level 459)\n|recommended = * {{SCP|Combat|95|link=yes}}\n* Teleport to Haunted Woods (fairy ring {{Fairycode|ALQ}}, Fenkenstrain's Castle Teleport, Kharyrll Teleport, or [[ectophial]] will get you close).\n* You may need an additional 10,000 coins to pay [[Andras]] for a trip to [[Slepe]]\n* Any [[pickaxe]] (bronze pickaxe obtainable during quest)\n* A [[hammer]] OR any [[axe]] which you have the [[Attack]] level to wield (bronze axe obtainable during quest).\n* [[Stamina potion]]s or [[energy potion]]s\n* [[Antipoison]] or [[Superantipoison]] potions\n* [[Drakan's medallion]]\n* [[Morytania legs 3]] ([[Hard Morytania Diary|Hard Diary]])\n* Combat equipment\n* Food\n* [[Prayer Potion]]\n|leagueRegion = <poem>\n{{RE|Morytania}} — location requirement\n</poem>\nPlayers attempting to start the quest may find that [[Veliaf Hurtz]] is not present in [[Slepe]].

Combat equipment for the next section.}}\nMake your way to [[Slepe]] by either:\n*Teleporting to [[Ver Sinhaza]] via [[Drakan's medallion]], then heading north. Once you pass the small dock, run east to arrive at Slepe. (If you've lost your [[Drakan's medallion|medallion]], you can reclaim it for free by speaking to [[Kael]] underneath [[Old Man Ral]]'s.)\n*Using the [[Ectophial]] to teleport to the [[Ectofuntus]], then heading north to the small dock and paying [[Andras]] 10,000 coins to row to Slepe. You will arrive at a dock just south-west of Slepe.\n[[File:Veliaf Hurtz chathead.png|left]]\nOnce in Slepe, speak to [[Veliaf Hurtz]] outside the church. He explains that the town has recently been exposed to an illness known as the Sleeper Plague, in which the afflicted fall into a deep sleep. Through his investigation, he suspects the [[vampyre]]s are responsible for causing the plague, and asks if you could try and find the source of the illness while he continues his investigation at the [[Crombwick Manor]]. Agree to help him.\n\nEnter the church and speak to [[Hameln the Jester]], whose travelling companion, [[Hanchen the Hound]], has succumbed to the Sleeper Plague. Ask him how he fell ill, and he will say that they both visited the local pub, The [[Rat & Bat]], for a few drinks. Shortly afterward, Hanchen began to fall ill and collapse.\n\n===Plague's End===\n{{Needed|Combat equipment|recommended=Food and [[prayer potion]]s}}\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Sins of the Father - Carl path.png|thumb|250px|The path you can take, and where to stand on to prevent being spotted.]]\n[[File:Sins of the Father - following Carl around Slepe.png|thumb|250px|Following Carl around Slepe.]]\nVisit The Rat & Bat just south-east of the church, and talk to [[Carl]] the barkeep. Ask him where he gets his [[bloody bracer]]s from, and he will act suspicious in response to your questions. Inspect the [[Barrel (Sins of the Father)|barrel]] behind the pub, you'll find out that Carl is just about out of Bloody Bracers, and decide to follow him.\n\nCarl will walk around Slepe and periodically turn around, where you will need to hide behind a piece of landscape or building in order to not be caught. If you are caught, you will start from the beginning again.\n# Go through the church and hide at the north doors, wait there until he passes the doors.\n# Proceed to the hollow tree just north of the graves, and hide on the eastern side.\n# When he reaches the centre square of the town, hide at the northern side of the hollow tree directly next to the gallows.\n# Once he enters the graveyard, hide at the western side of the hollow tree west of the graveyard.\n[[File:Carl chathead.png|left]]\nOnce Carl reaches the dungeon without you being caught, a cutscene will play in which Carl tells [[Kroy]], a vampyre herbalist, about you and your suspicions. After leaving, [[Damien Leucurte]] and [[Vanstrom Klause]] visit Kroy, and tells him about his discovery of the [[Elixir of Everlasting]], a formula created by [[Otrava]] of [[The Sisterhood]] which extends their lives, but with the side effect of sleeping for longer and longer periods until they never wake again.\n\nDamien and Kroy then admit that they were behind the re-emergence of the Sleeper Plague by mixing the Elixir with [[Bloody bracer]]s, so that they may perform larger blood tithes on the victims, who only require a fraction of the blood a normal human needs. Vanstrom is not happy with this, as he is in charge of Morytania's blood tithes and Damien has not obtained his permission to do this, risking unwanted attention. Vanstrom further warns him that you and The Myreque have already arrived in Slepe, and leaves for Darkmeyer.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nSins of the Father - Vanstrom and Damien.png|Damien introduces Vanstrom to Kroy.\nSins of the Father - confronting Kroy.png|Having both left, you proceed to confront Kroy.\nFighting Kroy.png|Fighting Kroy.\n</gallery>\n\nUpon both of them leaving, you will enter Kroy's lab. Knowing everything now, Kroy will attack you, using both melee and magic attacks.\n\nDuring the fight, pray [[Protect from Magic]] as his melee damage is lower than magic. Kroy can be harmed by weapons other than the [[Ivandis flail]], so it's recommended to take advantage of this by using [[ranged]] and safe-spotting from behind the northern tables.\n\nKroy will occasionally throw a vial that weakens you if you don't move out of the way. The animation is different from his regular attack; watch for a vial appearing in his hands. It's also visible in the air, meaning that safe-spotting will allow you to see it and move out of the way. After the vial is thrown, provided it does not hit you, a puddle will appear on the floor that will also weaken you if you walk over it. The fight is fairly easy once the mechanics are learned, but bring several pieces of food to be safe.\n\nUpon killing Kroy, destroy the two [[lab table]]s and return to Veliaf.\n\n===An Unwelcome Surprise===\n{{Needed|[[Knife]] (obtainable by searching knapsack), [[axe]] (obtainable by killing zombie), [[hammer]], a few inventory spaces, combat equipment and a weapon to harm [[Vampyre (attribute)#Tier 2 Vampyres|tier 2 vampyres]] (such as the [[Ivandis flail]]).|recommended=Two [[Salve graveyard teleport (tablet)|Salve Graveyard Teleports]], one [[Fenkenstrain's castle teleport (tablet)|Fenkenstrain's Castle Teleport]] and food to heal yourself and Ivan Strom.}}\n\n'''Note:''' Ensure that your pet is banked as it will prevent you from starting your trek with Ivan Strom\n\nUpon returning to Veliaf, you report that the vampyres are indeed the cause of the Sleeper Plague, and the conversation between Damien and Vanstrom. Veliaf comments about rumours he heard about the growing demand for blood since the vampyre population has been increasing, and also heard a small part of a conversation between the two at the Crombwick Manor, with Vanstrom accusing Damien of demanding too much blood tithes from the werewolves.\n\nVeliaf concludes that the werewolves are worth investigating, and that the increased demand of blood in Darkmeyer may cause unrest that the Myreque might be able to take advantage of. Before continuing the investigation, Veliaf wishes to check in with [[Drezel]] and [[Ivan Strom]] at [[Paterdomus]].\n[[File:Sins of the Father - werewolf meeting.png|thumb|left|250px|The werewolves deliver a family of three to Damien.]]\nHead to [[Drezel]] at the [[Paterdomus]]. He tells you and Veliaf that the kidnappings by the werewolves has escalated, and that Ivan has overheard of a meeting in the [[Haunted Woods]], which he has went to spy on. Veliaf is angered, asking Drezel why he'd let him go without any support, and that he must be kept safe. You then ask why Ivan is so important, and Drezel reveals he is the last living descendant of [[Ivandis Seergaze]], one of the [[Seven Priestly Warriors]], who originally blessed the [[River Salve]].\n\n[[File:Sins of the Father - Vanescula arrives.png|thumb|right|Vanescula Drakan ambushes you, Veliaf and Ivan.]]\nAfter a continuing argument about Ivan's fate, you suggest Veliaf and yourself head to the meeting spot and find Ivan. Ivan can be found directly south of [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]], and the meeting starts shortly. The meeting is between three werewolves and Damien Leucurte, who have delivered a family of three to Damien, confirming the suspicion that werewolves were behind the kidnappings. Ivan proposes that they follow the werewolves, but then [[Vanescula Drakan]], the sister of Lord [[Lowerniel Drakan]], knocks Veliaf back and snares him, you and Ivan.\n\n[[File:Sins of the Father - Vanescula proposes alliance.png|thumb|right|Vanescula Drakan offers her help to kill her brother.]]\nVanescula comes to talk with you and the group, offering the chance to kill her last remaining brother, Lord Drakan himself. Veliaf, suspicious of her intentions, asks her why she'd want her brother killed, but she refuses to share them where they are. Rather, she will explain herself at the [[Icyene Graveyard]], providing that all the Myreque members are there. Veliaf believes this to be a trap to lure them all out, but Vanescula reveals that she already knows where the [[Myreque Hideout]] is and that if they do not attend, she will kill the entire resistance group.\n\nLeft with no choice, Veliaf travels to the [[Burgh de Rott]] hideout to inform the rest of the group, and also inform [[Safalaan]]'s group in [[Meiyerditch]], while you escort Ivan down to Burgh de Rott. But first, Ivan needs to update Drezel on the situation and collect some things from Paterdomus. He tells you to meet him outside the temple once you're ready.\n\nHead west of [[Canifis]] (towards Paterdomus, near fairy ring, \"CKS\") and talk to Ivan Strom to begin your trek. This escort is similar to [[Temple Trekking]], but there are four set obstacles you and Ivan will face:\n\n#'''River crossing''' - Use a knife to cut 3 vines from the smaller trees, then wind the vines together to make a [[long vine]]. Throw the long vine to the larger tree's branch and swing over the river. If you forgot to bring a knife, search the nearby backpack to find one.\n#'''Nail beasts''' - Kill the three [[nail beast]]s, who range from level 69 to 141. If Ivan's health is low, use your food on him to heal him. '''Warning: If you use [[purple sweets]], Ivan will eat the whole stack!'''\n#'''Broken bridge''' - Chop down the trees and use the logs to fill the gaps in the bridge. You must either have a hammer in your inventory or be wielding an axe to repair the bridge. If you forgot to bring an axe, kill the nearby zombie for a [[bronze axe]].\n#'''Vampyre Juvinates''' - Kill the two Vampyre Juvinates. You will need a weapon to harm [[Vampyre (attribute)#Tier 2 Vampyres|tier 2 vampyres]]; the [[Ivandis flail]] works best. Immediately attack the vampyre in front of Ivan and then do the same to the other one to avoid Ivan's death. If it fails and Ivan's health is low, use your food on him to heal him.\n\nOnce at [[Burgh de Rott]], speak with Ivan Strom, who will head to the dock. After, head to the dock on the southern coast and speak with Veliaf or Ivan Strom. '''If you do not speak to either Ivan Strom or Veliaf Hurtz prior to boarding the boat, you will not have the option to sail to the Icyene Graveyard.'''\n\n===A Nice and Simple Plan===\n{{Needed|Combat equipment to kill a [[Mutated Bloodveld]] (level 123) (only for laboratory section, can access a bank before) and some free inventory space.|recommended=[[Pickaxe]], [[Drakan's medallion]], [[Morytania legs 3]] or [[Mort'ton teleport]]}}\n[[File:Sins of the Father - Vanescula meets Myreque.png|thumb|right|The entirety of the Myreque meet with Vanescula Drakan.]]\n'''Note:''' ''There is no combat required during the Icyene Graveyard section.'' \n\nHead to [[Icyene Graveyard]]. [[Safalaan]] will greet you and Veliaf, and promote you to lieutenant. [[Vanescula Drakan]] appears, and explains her plans. As the human population decreases, the vampyres' has continued to grow, and there is no longer enough blood to go around. And, despite this crisis, their leader, Lowerniel Drakan, has remained absent, spending months in his chambers and refusing to see anyone. She wishes to overthrow her brother, and rule with humans and vampyres coexisting peacefully, as they once did in the [[Zarosian Empire]] during the [[Second Age]]. She proposes helping the Myreque kill Lowerniel, with the Myreque taking credit for his death so that Vanescula can easily take his place without angering those loyal to Lowerniel. She adds that if the Myreque refuse her proposal, she will kill them if they remain in Morytania, as she can't afford any loose ends.\n\nWhile Vanescula lets the group think over her proposal, she asks to chat with Safalaan privately. Veliaf, remaining suspicious of her intentions, asks you to join them. Vanescula will reveal that she knows of Safalaan's hidden powers, and that the truth behind his heritage and powers will be found inside the large mausoleum, which was built for [[Queen Efaritay]] and [[King Ascertes]], the previous rulers of [[Morytania]] (then known as Hallowvale). However, the [[Mausoleum Door (Icyene Graveyard)|door]] is locked, and you must solve a puzzle to open it.\n\n[[File:Sins of the Father - Puzzle (2).png|thumb|A nearly-complete version of the puzzle that must be solved to unlock the mausoleum door.]]\nComplete the puzzle, which is similar to the popular game Kakurasu. The objective of the puzzle is to have the active numbers (different for each player), which are marked with the blue and yellow squares in each row/column, to add up to the number shown on that row/column. The red flags are not needed to solve the puzzle, but can help you mark off squares that they think they will not need. An easy place to start is by checking for any numbers in a row or column that are below 5, as you can use that to eliminate some of the possibilities. Additionally, some numbers can only be solved by a certain combination (e.g. 11 can be solved by using the numbers 5,3,2,1 or 5,4,2). To save yourself the trouble of the process of elimination, [https://oldschool.tools/calculators/sins-of-the-father-puzzle-solver this external website] will solve the puzzle for you.\n\n[[File:Sins of the Father - Safalaan's heritage.png|thumb|left|Safalaan discovers his half-icyene heritage.]]\nAfter the puzzle is complete, a cutscene plays in which you and Safalaan discover that he is the half-icyene and half-human son of Efaritay and Ascertes, and that he once had a sister, Larina Hallow, and that his powers were those of an [[icyene]]. Safalaan then asks where his parents' tombs are, since the mausoleum was built for them, but only his sister was found. He agrees to Vanescula's plan to overthrow Lowerniel, on the condition she reveals the whereabouts of his parents and that he be the one who deals the killing blow on her brother. Vanescula reveals that only Lowerniel knows of Efaritay's fate, and that Ascertes underwent the vampyrification process, becoming [[Vanstrom Klause]].\n\nNeeding some time alone, Safalaan asks you to speak to [[Ivan Strom]], [[Vertida Sefalatis]], [[Kael Forshaw]], [[Radigad Ponfit]], [[Polmafi Ferdygris]], and lastly [[Veliaf Hurtz]]. '''Note:''' You must speak with the other members before speaking to Veliaf or he will not agree.\n\nAfter getting everyone to agree, Vanescula believes that the laboratory beneath [[Meiyerditch]] may have more secrets to discover, some of which can potentially upgrade the Ivandis flail to give the Myreque a better fighting chance. You and Safalaan will search the laboratory together.\n\nPrepare for combat and make your way to the laboratory. A quick way to reach it is to teleport to [[Ver Sinhaza]] using your [[Drakan's medallion|Drakan's Medallion]] and speak to the [[Vyrewatch]] next to the bank and request to be sent to the mines; withdraw food and combat equipment before being sent to the mines. Mine 15 [[daeyalt ore]], place ore into empty cart, then talk to a Vyrewatch to get out (if you forgot a pickaxe, you can ask one of the miners for a bronze pickaxe). You will be transported out of the mines. Look around the houses for a staircase that goes <u>down</u> (Laboratory from [[Darkness of Hallowvale]]). The building is against the eastern wall. Go towards the house you had to enter before going up the stairs to make the jump and enter the secret carpet room. From here continue going north-east staying near the eastern wall. You will find the house with a clearly visible large tapestry in one of the rooms, coloured red and yellow. Walk through the slashed tapestry, and go down the stairs.\n\n[[File:Sins of the Father - Mutated Bloodveld.png|thumb|right|Safalaan unintentionally unleashes his icyene powers to kill a mutated bloodveld.]]\nTalk to [[Safalaan]] and you both will explore the laboratory. However, a [[Mutated Bloodveld]] will appear, and Safalaan unintentionally unleashes his icyene powers to kill it, knocking him out. Another will appear, and you must kill it. The fight is very simple and straightforward, and the bloodveld can be very easily safespotted. Once you've killed it, speak to Safalaan again, and he will question the usefulness of his powers since he has no control over how and when he could use them.\n\nAfter speaking to him, head west to the next room and search the bookshelf against the western wall (behind two cages) to obtain a book titled [[Haemalchemy volume 2]]. Return to Safalaan and give him the book. He will then ask you to return to the Icyene Graveyard. Teleport or walk back to Burgh de Rott, run south-east and use the boat back to the Icyene Graveyard.\n\n===A Vyre-ry Noble Disguise===\n{{Needed|[[Ivandis flail]], armour, [[Vyrewatch outfit]] or 1,950 coins|recommended=[[Drakan's medallion]], [[Morytania legs 3]] or [[Mort'ton teleport]], some [[food]], an [[antipoison]], 1-2 [[prayer potion]]s, and 1 [[super combat potion]].}}\n{{Instance}}\nSpeak to either Veliaf, Safalaan or Vanescula, who tells you of the [[Blisterwood tree]], a tree created by Efaritay whose wood is lethal to vampyres. She suggests using Blisterwood to enhance the Myreque's weapons. However, the only known Blisterwood tree is found in Efaritay's old Arboretum, in the middle of Darkmeyer. Vanescula suggests modifying a vyrewatch outfit to one of a vampyre noble to blend in better, and Safalaan suggests you take the disguise to [[Polmafi Ferdygris]] at the Myreque Hideout under [[Old Man Ral]]'s house.\n\nIf you don't already have a vyrewatch outfit, you can purchase a set for 1,950 coins from [[Trader Sven's Black-market Goods]] directly south of Old Man Ral's house. Head to the Myreque Hideout (down the Trap Door in Old Man Ral's house) and have Polmafi modify your outfit, turning them into a vyre noble outfit, albeit unscented. Return to the Icyene Graveyard and speak to Vanescula.\n\nAs the vampyres have a very keen sense of smell, the outfit must be scented with blood, but it must be the blood of a noble, as Darkmeyer's nobility won't go interacting with lesser vampyres. Vanescula suggests killing two birds with one stone by killing [[Damien Leucurte]], who is an obscure, lesser noble and has become a problem that needs to be resolved.\n\nHead to a bank and gear up for the fight, where you'll be taking on Damien (level 204), who can only be harmed with the Ivandis flail. The fight is relatively simple. You'll want to bring some food (especially for lower levels), 1-2 prayer potions, combat potions and a way to cure [[poison]]. Once you are ready, head to Slepe where you first spoke to Veliaf. You can either teleport using Drakan's Medallion and run or take the boat from Icyene Graveyard.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nSins of the Father - confronting Damien.png|You and Veliaf confront Damien Leucurte.\nFighting Damien Leucurte.png|You and Veliaf battle against Damien Leucurte.\n</gallery>\n\n[[Damien Leucurte]] can be found in Crombwick Manor, (the large manor in the northern part of Slepe), to fight him, you must speak with Veliaf where you first start the quest. Damien uses a combination of ranged and magic attacks, periodically spreading magical fire around the room during the fight. '''You must stamp out the fires or he will become increasingly resistant to your attacks.''' He can also poison you during the fight. By using [[Protect from Magic]] and stamping out the fires he produces, you shouldn't take much damage. Veliaf will help you in the fight, but do not expect him to do much damage.\n\nOnce you are victorious and have spoken to Veliaf, return to Icyene Graveyard and speak with Vanescula Drakan, who tells you of a small [[Cracked wall|crack in the southern wall]] that you can use to enter Darkmeyer.\n\n''Note: If you teleport out of the Damien encounter immediately as he hits zero health, your quest guide will update properly but your Vyre Outfit will continue to be the Unscented version. If this happens, it will vanish after you speak with Vanescula and will need to be reclaimed from the Myreque base under Old Man Ral's house. The stairs in Kroy's lab lead back to the manor if the player misses the dialogue with Veliaf.''\n\n===The Branches of Darkmeyer===\n{{Needed|[[Vyre noble disguise]], an [[axe]], eight free inventory spaces|recommended=Weight reducing gear, stamina potion, ways to restore run energy.}}\nWear your vyre noble disguise and ask any vyrewatch to send you to the mines. As they perceive you to be a noble, you need not mine any daeyalt ore to leave; you will simply be escorted out. Once you exit the mine, head north to the crack and enter it to arrive in Darkmeyer. You will arrive at the lower tier of the city; prior to the quest's completion, you will not be able to access any of the features, which includes the bank. You can however use the altar south of the bank.\n\nMake your way to the Arboretum in the middle of the city, and attempt to enter; a guard named [[Desmodus Lasiurus]] will stop you, telling you that the Drakans have ordered that no one can enter the Arboretum. You will ask him if there is anything you can do for him to give you access, and he will say a juvinate named [[Mordan Nikazsi]] was supposed to deliver some slaves ([[Maria Gadderanks|Maria]] and [[Ron Gadderanks]]) to him, but he has not shown up.\n\nMordan Nikazsi can be found in the lower tier of the city in a house near the eastern outer wall in a building with a water source icon ([[File:Water source icon.png]]), two houses north of the furnace. He tells you that he sold Desmodus' slaves to [[Lord Alexei Jovkai]], the head of House Jovkai, and that the slaves are in his prison directly south of the food shop ([[File:Food shop icon.png]] icon).\n\nAt the prison, speak to [[Maria Gadderanks]], who tells you they arrived here a short while ago, and are already well treated. Another prisoner interrupts, telling you Lord Jovkai keeps them well looked after, with a nice bed, good food and clean clothes on the condition that they give him a bit of blood from time to time. The vyrewatch then asks you to leave as Lord Jovkai enters, asking you what you are doing here. You will tell him that the prisoners were promised to Desmodus, but Lord Jovkai tells you he's already paid for them and you'll have to find some different slaves.\n\n[[File:Sins of the Father - Sarius saves you.png|thumb|right|Sarius stops Vanstrom from recognising you and breaking your cover.]]\nVanstrom Klause then enters the prison, and argues with Lord Jovkai that the Gadderanks belong to Desmodus, and orders Lord Jovkai to return them to him. Vanstrom then realises your voice sounds familiar, and asks that you turn and face him. As he does, [[Sarius Guile]], Vanescula's servant, asks Vanstrom to see Vanescula as she has urgent need of him, stopping him from recognising you and breaking your cover.\n\nReturn to Desmodus, who will now let you enter the Arboretum. Upon entering, search the toppled [[Shelves (Sins of the Father)|shelves]] for an [[Old note (Sins of the Father)|old note]]. Before you can cut the [[Blisterwood tree]], you will need to hydrate the tree by regulating the flow of water. Read the old note to find out how many gallons are needed to hydrate the tree (this is different for each player). The valves are found by the entrance; the northern valve sends seven gallons of water per interval, while the southern valve sends four gallons per interval.\n\nThe table below shows the solution. Each column represents the amount of intervals for the northern valve, while each row represents the amount of intervals for the southern valve.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+Solutions\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold;\"\n! North valve →<br />South valve ↓\n! 0\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n! 5\n|-\n! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 0\n| 0\n| 7\n| 14\n| 21\n| 28\n| 35\n|-\n! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 1\n| 4\n| 11\n| 18\n| 25\n| 32\n| 39\n|-\n! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 2\n| 8\n| 15\n| 22\n| 29\n| 36\n| 43\n|-\n! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 3\n| 12\n| 19\n| 26\n| 33\n| 40\n| 47\n|-\n! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 4\n| 16\n| 23\n| 30\n| 37\n| 44\n| 51\n|-\n! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 5\n| 20\n| 27\n| 34\n| 41\n| 48\n| 55\n|}\n\nOnce you have the correct valve settings, chop eight [[Blisterwood logs]] and return to the Icyene Graveyard.\n\n===The Final Preparations===\n{{Needed|8 [[blisterwood logs]], [[knife]], [[chisel]], [[ruby]], [[Ivandis flail]] and either 5 [[fire rune]]s and a [[cosmic rune]] or an [[Enchant ruby or topaz|enchant ruby tablet]].}}\nSpeak to Vanescula, who tells you that she had Sarius keep an eye on you, and that her intervening with Vanstrom saved you. She then tells you that she's given Vertida the required information to craft the weapons.\n\nHead to the Myreque Hideout under Old Man Ral's house and speak to Vertida. He will tell you how to make a ruby sickle. Search the nearby crate for a [[Silver sickle (b)|silver sickle]], then combine the silver sickle and [[ruby]] (requires a chisel). Enchant the [[Ruby sickle (b)|ruby sickle]]. Craft the [[Blisterwood Sickle]] with an [[Enchanted ruby sickle (b)|enchanted ruby sickle]], [[Blisterwood logs|Blisterwood log]], and a [[knife]] in your inventory. Use the [[Blisterwood Sickle]] on the [[Ivandis flail|Ivandis Flail]] to get a [[Blisterwood flail]], as well as getting back the [[Enchanted emerald sickle (b)|enchanted emerald sickle]] that was previously attached.\n\n#Search the nearby crate for a [[Silver sickle (b)|silver sickle]]\n#Attach a ruby to the sickle to create a [[ruby sickle (b)]].\n#Cast [[Lvl-3 Enchant]] on the ruby sickle, or use an [[enchant ruby or topaz]] [[tablet]] on it.\n#Use the Blisterwood logs on the [[Enchanted ruby sickle (b)|enchanted ruby sickle]] to create a [[Blisterwood sickle]].\n#Lastly, use the Blisterwood sickle on the [[Ivandis flail]] to create the [[Blisterwood flail]].\n\nReturn to the Icyene Graveyard. Talk to Veliaf, who will tell you that Safalaan has gone for a walk north of the Icyene Graveyard, and will send you after him. He can be found just north of the graveyard, staring out over the water to the east. Talk to him; both he and you will share your regrets before you both return to the Graveyard.\n\n===A Bloody Show===\n{{Needed|[[Blisterwood flail]], combat equipment.|recommended=High magic defence gear, equipment with crush attack bonuses, a fast ranged weapon, 43 prayer to use protection prayers (70+ recommended for [[Piety]]), high healing food, prayer potions, super combat potions and an emergency teleport.}}\n{{Instance|irs=Veliaf|cost=50000}}\n'''{{Colour|Red|Warning}}:''' You will have to battle [[Vanstrom Klause]], who can hit through prayers and has a fairly high Defence level of 180. It is recommended to bring an emergency teleport during your first attempt.\n\nSpeak to Vanescula at the Icyene Graveyard once you are combat-ready. Vanescula will teleport the Myreque and take you all to [[Castle Drakan]] as her prisoners. Vanstrom will ask her how she managed to capture all the Myreque, with her telling him that she convinced them that she was on their side, then tricked them into coming to Castle Drakan. Before she enters the Castle, [[Lowerniel Drakan]] exits, already knowing Vanescula's true intentions of overthrowing him, and demands she tell him why she made that decision.\n\nEnraged, Lowerniel proceeds to kill her vyre servants and instantly subdues his sister. Forced to take action, [[Polmafi]], [[Kael]], [[Vertida]] and [[Radigad]] attack, but are instantly incinerated by Lowerniel. Lowerniel then orders Vanstrom to kill the rest of you. Safalaan tries to reason with Vanstrom, knowing that he was once his father prior to the vampyrification process. Vanstrom disregards him, and knocks Safalaan out. You must now fight Vanstrom Klause.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nSins of the Father - Vanescula talks to Vanstrom.png|Vanescula takes the Myreque to Castle Drakan as her \"prisoners\".\nSins of the Father - Lord Drakan appears.gif|His-Dark-Self the Lord of Vampyrium, Lowerniel Vergidiyad Drakan, appears at last.\nSins of the Father - Lord Drakan.png|Lowerniel Drakan is already aware of his sister's betrayal.\nSins of the Father - Drakan chokes Vanescula.png|Lowerniel Drakan subdues his sister.\nSins of the Father - Drakan kills Myreque.png|Polmafi, Kael, Vertida and Radigad are immediately incinerated.\nSins of the Father - Vanstrom fights.png|Vanstrom is left to kill the remaining Myreque members.\n</gallery>\n\n====Battling Vanstrom Klause====\n{{Equipment\n|align = right\n|head = Helm of neitiznot\n|cape = Fire cape\n|neck = Amulet of fury\n|ammo = Rada's blessing 2\n|weapon = Blisterwood flail\n|torso = Fighter torso\n|legs = Karil's leatherskirt\n|shield = Dragon defender\n|gloves = Barrows gloves\n|boots = Dragon boots\n|ring = Berserker ring (i)\n|caption = Suggested gear\n}}\n\n[[File:Fighting Vanstrom Klause.png|thumb|right|The player battles against Vanstrom Klause.]]\n[[Vanstrom Klause]] is level 459, and is a very difficult fight, far beyond the normal master level difficulty. It is very important to dodge all special attacks. The ring of recoil '''does not''' work during this fight, nor does vengeance. The player is also unable to summon [[thrall]]s.\n\nShould you die during the fight, lost items can be retrieved from Veliaf at the Icyene Graveyard for 50,000 coins (you are not required to have the coins in your inventory). Veliaf can also be used to send you back to the final fight - if going back, activate potions before speaking to Veliaf. If you die at the same time you kill Vanstrom, you do not have to fight him again.\n\n'''Low Level Players:''' If you are struggling, especially Ironmen without access to brews, you can set up a Vampyre Slayer task prior to fighting the boss to receive the bonus from the [[Black mask]] or [[Slayer helmet]].{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1366010324730736640|date=28 February 2021|archiveurl=https://archive.is/AX7rf|archivedate=10 June 2021|quote=I think that's true for him, Damian and Kroy, as well as juvinates.|notes=In response to the question: \"Is it true that Vanstrom Klause and others from SotF can be killed as part of a Vampyre task?\"}}\n\n'''Note: Turn off [[Auto Retaliate|auto-retaliate]] before the fight!'''\n\n====== Phase 1 ======\nIt is recommended to have some magic defence gear and [[Protect from Magic]] active during this phase, as he will primarily use a magic based attack which will also heal him for a portion of the damage dealt. Protect from Magic does not make you immune, but reduces damage taken by 50%. [[Piety]] (or, less ideally, [[Chivalry]]) is also highly recommended. Vanstrom can use an attack that lowers your Attack level similar to Shadow Spells, so bring at least one form of Attack-raising potion with you. A piece or two of [[Karil the Tainted's equipment|Karil's armour]] or [[Black dragonhide armour|black]]/[[Blessed dragonhide armour|blessed d'hide]] is usually good enough. Full [[Eclipse moon armour]] may be an even better choice due to it providing both a strength bonus and high magic defence bonus. You should bring a [[super combat potion]] '''or''' a [[divine super combat potion]] and [[Super attack]] potion, 2-4 prayer potions, and the highest level [[food]] possible or 1-tick [[combo food]]s such as [[karambwan]]s, paired with [[shark]]s or better. Bring a few of any quality of [[throwing knife]] or [[dart]] as a range switch for the [[Acidic Bloodveld]] special attack; these will one-shot the bloodveld regardless of quality.\n\nFor [[Ironman Mode|Ironmen]], you may have to make compromises on gear - prioritise Magic defence (over 100) and then Melee Strength Bonus and accuracy to increase DPS. Even with around 80 Attack, the Piety prayer, and super attack potions, you still only have around a 60-65% chance to hit Vanstrom with the flail, so consider bringing a (full) [[Efaritay's aid]] ring to increase your accuracy. If you don't have access to [[super combat potion]]<nowiki/>s yet, a good strategy is to pre-pot a [[Super strength]] and [[Super defence]] potion at the Burgh de Rott bank so you can bring 2 more pieces of food, but take the [[Super attack]] potion with you so you can deal with Vanstrom's Attack drain during the fight.\n\nIn phase 1, Vanstrom will do 1 of the following 3 special attacks after 9-12 regular attacks. This does not apply at the start of the fight, so the first special attack can occur at any time, after which the counter of 9-12 regular attacks and 1 special attack will start. He will never repeat the same special attack in succession.\n\n#\"'''''My pets will feast on your corpse!'''''\" - Vanstrom will summon an [[acidic bloodveld]] that walks towards you. You must kill the bloodveld from a distance or it will explode when it reaches you and hit you for 35-50 damage. The creature will always appear on the far north or south side of the arena (whichever one is furthest away from you) so it is recommended to keep some distance to either side of the room to give yourself more time to deal with them. Bring a range switch to kill them, ideally fast attacking 1-slot equipment such as knives/darts, as you have perfect accuracy against it and only need to hit it once. Putting these on the '''longrange''' style is convenient''',''' as the 1 tick faster attack speed of the rapid style isn't worth the two extra tiles you'll have to get closer to it. Runes in a [[rune pouch]] (e.g. for [[Wind Strike]], which can also one-shot the bloodvelds) also work and, whilst slower to use, do not require a change of weapon and have a longer range. Do not walk on the acid pool that appears afterward as you will take damage.\n#\"'''''Stare into darkness!'''''\" - Vanstrom will turn your screen dark and you will be hit upwards of 40+ damage. This can be avoided by almost immediately stepping 1 tile away from him upon seeing the text appear above his head. Relying on reflexes for this special move may be difficult for some, especially at a high [[Ping (Server)|ping]]. If you find it too difficult to react in time, try stepping away after each of his attacks and not facing towards him on his next attack. Another strategy is to move in a circle around Vanstrom while attacking to avoid most damage from this attack.\n#\"'''''Blood will be my strength!'''''\" - Vanstrom will summon a blood orb that is visually 1x1 tile in size, but is actually 3x3. This orb increases the damage of Vanstrom's magic attacks, even with [[Protect from Magic]]. You can lure him to the orb to destroy it and damage Vanstrom by 20+ or so damage, or destroy it yourself and take over 47 damage in the process. Higher levelled players may also simply wait for the orb to disappear.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nSins of the Father - My pets will feast on your corpse!.png|Vanstrom summons an acidic bloodveld.\nSins of the Father - Stare into darkness!.png|Darkness emanates from Vanstrom, heavily damaging you.\nSins of the Father - Vanstrom's blood orb.png|Vanstrom summons a blood orb, strengthening his magicks.\n</gallery>\n\n====== Phase 2 ======\nOnce Vanstrom reaches 0 health, he will heal himself for 200 hitpoints and stop performing his special attacks. During the second phase, he will begin to summon waves of 10-15 randomly located lightning bolts every 2 seconds or so. These strike for up to 40 damage after a short delay and can be anticipated by watching the shadows on the floor and avoiding tiles where lightning will strike (these can be hard to see if using the [[RuneLite#117 HD plugin|117 HD plugin]] on the [[RuneLite]] client; consider disabling the plugin for this encounter). In addition, his regular attacks will now hit with 100% accuracy and deal between 0-10 damage. These attacks are '''unaffected''' by protection prayers so any remaining prayers should be switched to useful non-overhead prayers between phases (such as [[Piety]]). [[Redemption]] may also be wise to keep on as a last resort here, as it's easy to focus so much on dodging his lightning attacks that his regular attacks end up whittling you down.  \n\nYou'll want to constantly be attacking Vanstrom despite the lightning bolts, so it's best to simply step one tile around him clockwise or counter-clockwise each time the tile you're on gets targeted. Do remember to keep an eye on both the tile you're on and the tile you're planning to walk to, or you may dodge one lightning strike only to be hit by another one. Be sure to save some one-tick food (such as karambwans) for this phase as the lightning bolts strike quickly and it's very easy to die in the space of a few seconds should you fail to get out of the way quick enough.  \n\n[[File:Sins of the Father - Vanstrom lightning.png|thumb|right|Vanstrom summons a barrage of lightning down on you.]]\n===Shattered===\nUpon defeat, Safalaan will beg Vanstrom to stop, and remember who he once was. Vanstrom reveals that he remembers his past life, and knowingly killed Larina. Enraged, Safalaan unleashes his icyene powers, and Vanstrom will seemingly perish in the resulting blast as he explodes. Now in shock, Safalaan is unable to move; Veliaf orders Ivan to teleport him out, but he is too far away. As [[Vyrewatch Sentinel]]s approach the Myreque, Veliaf makes the tough decision to leave Safalaan behind, and Ivan teleports you, himself and Veliaf out.\n\nIn shock at the sheer power of Lord Drakan, abandoning Safalaan and the loss of Polmafi, Kael, Vertida and Radigad, Veliaf declares the Myreque's death and leaves the hideout, leaving you and Ivan behind. Ivan asks you for some time alone, and decides to stay in the hideout.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nSins of the Father - Safalaan kills Vanstrom.png|Enraged at Vanstrom, Safalaan fully unleashes his icyene powers.\nSins of the Father - Ivan teleports.png|Unable to reach Safalaan, Ivan teleports you, himself and Veliaf out in the nick of time.\nSins of the Father - Safalaan abandoned.png|Safalaan is abandoned and left behind.\nSins of the Father - the Myreque shattered.png|Veliaf declares the Myreque dead, leaving you and Ivan.\n</gallery>\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Sins of the Father\n|image = [[File:Sins of the Father reward scroll.png|center]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*Access to [[Darkmeyer]]\n**Access to the [[Daeyalt Essence Mine]]\n**Access to the [[Hallowed Sepulchre]]\n**Ability to shop at stores in Darkmeyer while wearing [[Vyre noble clothing]]\n**Ability to use the [[Wall (Darkmeyer)|wall]] shortcut on the eastern side of Darkmeyer with 63 Agility, after purchasing two [[long rope]]s from the [[Darkmeyer General Store]] and using them on it.\n*A [[Tome of experience (Sins of the Father)|tome of experience]], granting 15,000 experience to any skill.

We'll keep you updated throughout.\n\nWe'd like to apologise again, and we greatly appreciate your patience whilst we resolve this issue.}}\n* The title of the quest is a reference to the Biblical concept of ancestral sin, from [https://biblestudytools.com/exodus/20-5.html Exodus 20:5]: \"I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me.\" This is reflected in the relationship between Safalaan Hallow and his father Ascertes/Vanstrom. \n* Because of the quest ending on a somber note, the standard quest completion music is replaced to fit the mood. Other quests that replace the normal jingles are [[Mountain Daughter]] and [[Monkey Madness II]].\n[[File:Icyene Graveyard sunken statue.png|thumb|300px|A sunken icyene statue seen north of the graveyard, possibly a remnant of The Everlight.]]\n[[File:Darkmeyer Key Art with logo.jpg|thumb|300px|A piece of official artwork of the quest, showing the Myreque facing Lowerniel Drakan.]]\n* Several references to {{RSL|Everlight Dig Site|The Everlight}}, a digsite in ''RuneScape'' accessed via the {{RSL|Archaeology}} skill, can be found in-game.\n** A mud mound can be dug up with a [[spade]] to obtain a [[journal page]] and some [[Ancient armour (item)|ancient armour]], which references the Everlight.\n** While Safalaan is staring out into the ocean before the end of the quest, pieces of rubble can be seen with what looks to be Icyene statues on them.\n** Ivan's dialogue in the graveyard at this point in the quest mentions that a team of archaeologists could potentially find something big if they came here.\n* One of the gravestones in the Icyene Graveyard has the examine text \"'Hope is the thing with feathers.' ~ E.D\". This is a direct reference to the poem ''{{WP|\"Hope\" is the thing with feathers}}'' by American poet {{WP|Emily Dickinson}}.\n* The gravestone at the easternmost part of the Icyene Graveyard reads \"'Nostalgia is a side effect of dying.' - John the Greenseer\". This is a reference to the quote 'Depression is a side effect of dying.' by author John Green.\n* In ''RuneScape'', the fifth instalment of the Myreque questline is {{RSL|The Branches of Darkmeyer}}, from which Sins of the Father borrows a number of elements, in addition to {{RSL|The Lord of Vampyrium}}, the sequel to The Branches of Darkmeyer, with some minor differences:\n** Vanescula Drakan first meets the player, Veliaf and Ivan in the Haunted Woods, and proposes her plan alongside the Myreque in the Icyene Graveyard. In The Branches of Darkmeyer, she meets only the player and reveals to you the full details of her plans in the slums of Meiyerditch.\n** In ''RuneScape'', the Icyene Graveyard is not visited until The Lord of Vampyrium (the sixth installment of the series), and is only visited by Safalaan and the player. In addition, the player discovers Safalaan's heritage during their fight with Vanstrom at the end of The Branches of Darkmeyer, rather than at the Graveyard.\n** The Branches of Darkmeyer contains a section in which players must perform various activities within Darkmeyer while disguised as a lowly vampyre to gain status within vampyre society in order to access the Arboretum. This does not occur in Sins of the Father, as the player is already given several tasks to disguise themselves as a vampyre noble.\n** In The Branches of Darkmeyer, the player encounters [[Maria Gadderanks]] in a vampyric prison in Darkmeyer and has the opportunity to free her, with the option to tell her or lie to her about [[Gadderanks]]'s death. This is unlike Sins of the Father, where the player takes Maria away from her relatively good living conditions under Lord Jovkai and leaves her with a less caring vampyre. Maria's son [[Ron Gadderanks]] appears alongside Maria in Sins of the Father, but does not appear in The Branches of Darkmeyer or anywhere else in ''RuneScape''.\n** In ''RuneScape'', the player's identity is compromised by Ranis, whereas in the Sins of the Father, the player is nearly compromised by Vanstrom. In both, they are saved by Vanescula's intervention, although Vanescula directly intervenes in the former and indirectly does so in the latter.\n** Vanescula mentions that there's no need to discard the Ivandis flail and instead it can simply be upgraded with Blisterwood. This is a reference to the fact that in The Branches of Darkmeyer, the player discards the flail entirely for Blisterwood weapons, such as the Blisterwood polearm, staff and stakes.\n** During Sins of the Father, the Myreque are taken to [[Castle Drakan]] as \"prisoners\" of Vanescula Drakan and most are killed instantly after Lowerniel Drakan appears and subdues his sister. In comparison, during The Lord of Vampyrium, the Myreque (disguised as vyre nobles), with the help of Vanescula Drakan, ambush Lowerniel Drakan on the rooftop of [[Castle Drakan]] upon his return from [[Vampyrium]], where the attack fails and he slowly kills off the remainder of the Myreque over the course of the quest, and is eventually killed by the player at the end.\n**In Branches of Darkmeyer, Vanescula states that she is powerful enough to kill Lowerniel herself, and is not doing so because she doesn't want to cause political instability within Vampyre society. In Sins of the Father, Lowerniel effortlessly subdues her and makes it very clear that he is much more powerful than her. \n** At the end of Sins of the Father, Ivan is forced to abandon Safalaan as he becomes surrounded by vyrewatch sentinels, leaving his fate uncertain. In The Lord of Vampyrium, Vanescula \"kills\" Safalaan to take his blood, which is of Icyenic origin, to sanctify herself against the [[River Salve]], and plans to use haemalchemy to transfer this blood to the rest of the vampyres; Safalaan is later revealed to be alive in the next quest in the series, {{RSL|River of Blood}}.\n* After Sins of the Father, Ivan's examine text changes to \"The last remaining member of the Myreque\". This isn't technically true since the player is also a member of the Myreque.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Sins of the Father}}"

Since any man usually makes more sense sober, you will have to pour a [[bucket of water]] over his head; a well-known cure to drunkenness. \n\n===Nettle tea===\nSkippy will sober up, but becomes annoyed by the fact he is now wet. He will ask for a [[nettle tea]] to warm himself up. You'll need to put [[nettles]] in a [[bowl of water]] to create [[nettle-water]], then boil it on a [[range]] or [[fire]] to obtain [[nettle tea]]. [[Nettles]] can be found nearby, south of the [[Draynor Village jail]], or in [[Edgeville]], near the yew trees, and have to be gathered with [[gloves]]. Conveniently, a pair of [[leather gloves]] spawn next to the nettles in Edgeville. You might overboil the water however, therefore it is recommended to pick multiple nettles. You can barge into the house next to Skippy to use the range there.\n\nHead back and ''use'' the nettle tea on Skippy. He will now be sober enough to realise that he has a hangover and requires a [[hangover cure]]. This cure can be made by grinding [[chocolate]] into [[chocolate dust]] with a [[knife]] or [[pestle and mortar]], adding the chocolate dust to a [[bucket of milk]], and then using [[snape grass]] on the [[chocolatey milk]]. Snape grass can be found nearby in the [[Hobgoblin peninsula]], west of the [[Crafting Guild]]. A [[dairy cow]] is also present near the guild. Chocolate and a knife can be bought in [[Port Sarim]].\n\nReturn to Skippy and ''use'' the cure on him. This will cure him. He will then explain that he had been attacked by [[mogre]]s, and shows you a trick to gently chase them out of the water with [[fishing explosive]]s. \n\n'''Congratulations!

The quickest way there is the [[Grouping]] teleport to Giants' Foundry. Alternatively, travel to Al Kharid using an [[amulet of glory]] and head east from the palace. Past the [[Hill Giant (Giants' Plateau)|Hill Giants]], a singular Hill Giant with a \"Strike\" option rather than an \"Attack\" option can be seen by a [[Giant anvil (Giants' Plateau)|giant anvil]]. Attempt to strike the Hill Giant, and it will ask you to stop, requesting your help. Accept his request to start the quest.\n\nThe Hill Giant, whose name is Kovac, will ask you to accompany him to the cave next to him. A cutscene will play, showing a workshop too big for regular-sized people to use. This is the [[Giants' Foundry]], where giants of ages past once forged weapons. Kovac wishes to restore the foundry to forge giant weapons to help his kin remember how civilised their race once was. \n\nYou must now repair the various features of the foundry that have been dilapidated. If you forgot to bring any of the required items, a big chest can be found which accesses your bank.\n* [[Trip hammer]] - 1x Oak log, 5x nails\n* [[Grindstone]] - Chisel\n* [[Polishing wheel]] - 2x Oak log, 5x nails, 1x wool\n\n===Make-A-Sword===\n[[File:Giants' Foundry - Foundry Overview.png|thumb|300px|An overview of the features in the Giants' Foundry.]]\n[[File:Ultimate_ironman_chat_badge.png]] You will need 20 empty inventory spaces for max 20 seconds. Drop your items, search the crate, speak to Kovac, use items on the crucible then recover items.\n\n'''Warning:''' The initial room is an instance, pick up any dropped items before talking to Kovac or they will be lost.\n\nSpeak to Kovac once you've repaired the aforementioned objects. He will now ask that you make a sword for his old friend; this part of the quest acts as an interactive tutorial for the [[Giants' Foundry]] minigame.\n\nSearch the crate near the cave exit for an assortment of bronze and iron items, and use them on the crucible. Once it is full, speak to Kovac again, and he will tell you to set up the mould for the sword's forte, blade, and tip which match the commission.\n\nOnce you've got a fitting mould set, speak to Kovac and pour the molten metal from the crucible into the mould jig. With no weapon and shield equipped, use a [[bucket of water]] to cool the sword and obtain the [[preform]]. An empty bucket can be taken from the pile next to the polishing wheel, and filled by using the bucket on the waterfall. Alternatively, a bucket of water is not needed if you have [[ice gloves]] equipped.\n\nNow, you must refine the preform into a quality giant sword:\n* Heat the preform to maximum by using it on the [[lava pool]].  The \"Heat-preform\" option will increase the heat by small increments, while the \"Dunk-preform\" option will heat it faster. The temperature should be red.\n* Hit the preform with the Trip Hammer repaired earlier, repeating until progress bar is onto the yellow section. Be sure to keep the temperature in the red while doing this, otherwise the quality of the sword will decrease. Using the Trip Hammer will cool the preform.\n* Cool the preform using the [[Waterfall (Giants' Foundry)|waterfall]] until its temperature is almost green. The \"Cool-preform\" option will cool the preform slowly, while the \"Quench-preform\" option cools it more quickly.\n* Use the preform on Grindstone repaired earlier, repeating until progress is onto green section. Be sure to watch the temperature as the Grindstone will heat the preform during use.\n* Cool the preform in the waterfall until its temperature is high green.\n* Use the preform on the Polishing Wheel, repeating until the sword is complete. The Polishing Wheel will cool the preform during use, so be sure to watch the temperature.\n* '''Note:''' Kovac will accept any quality sword for the purpose of this quest, though he will comment on it being not quite up to standard.\n\nOnce you've completed the sword, speak to Kovac again. He will reveal that the sword was made for his old friend [[Obor]], who resides in the [[Edgeville Dungeon]].\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Sleeping Giants\n|image = \n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n* {{SCP|Smithing|6,000}} [[Smithing]] experience\n* Access to the [[Giants' Foundry]]\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Unlock details\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Music track\n|-\n|[[The Foundry]]\n|Unlocked upon entering the [[Giants' Foundry]]\n|[[File:The Foundry.ogg]]\n|}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 25 September 2024\n|update = Varlamore: The Rising Darkness is OUT NOW\n|change = Players will now recieve a warning when attempting to drop an item within the Foundry during the quest.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Developers==\n*'''Main developer(s):''' [[Mod Oasis]]\n* '''Quality Assurance''': [[Mod Moogle]]\n* '''Art''': [[Mod Brow]], [[Mod Ry]], [[Mod Soffan]], [[Mod West]]\n* '''Audio''': {{RSL|Mod Grace}}\n\n{{Sleeping Giants}}"

He'll tell you about the city of [[Witchaven]], which has had some rather strange things going on recently. He'll tell you to check in with their local agent in Witchaven, [[Col. Jake O'Niall]]. Sir Tiffy Cashien will then upgrade your [[Commorb]] to [[Commorb v2]], which will start the quest. Use the ''contact'' option on Commorb v2 and head to Witchaven.\n\n===Witchaven===\n[[O'Niall]] sits on a rocking chair on the pier at the north-east corner of town. Talk to him, and he'll tell you that some of the people have been acting strangely recently, especially [[Mayor Eustace Hobb]]. Recently, he started looking rather sickly and working feverishly to restore the ancient, ruined [[Witchaven Dungeon|shrine]] just west of town (between [[Witchaven]] and [[Ardougne]]). Before leaving, ask O'Niall about who the important people in town are, which are [[Mayor Hobb]], [[Brother Maledict]], and [[Holgart]]. Speak to each of them in any order.\n\n====The mayor====\n[[Mayor Hobb]]'s house is the one at the north-west side of [[Witchaven]]. Talk to him, and ask him about Witchaven or the shrine. When you are done speaking to him, don't go anywhere as [[Savant]] will stop you. She'll ask you to scan the mayor, so ''scan'' with the [[Commorb v2]].\n\n'''Note: You need to finish the dialogue with Mayor Hobb with \"Nothing at the moment, thanks\" after asking the questions to make Savant ask you to scan him. It takes 3–4 seconds before she contacts you after ending the conversation.'''\n\n====Brother Maledict and Holgart====\n[[Brother Maledict]] will mention that he's a bit worried about some of his congregation, who have begun to act a little bit strangely lately. You can finish the dialogue without asking more questions. Walk a little bit north and talk to [[Holgart]], who'll tell you that the mayor recently took his boat and gave it to another man named [[Jeb]], standing near by.\n\n===The shrine===\n[[File:Slug menace wall.png|right|thumb|200px|The false wall.]]\nReport back to [[O'Niall]] to tell him what you have found out so far. He'll suggest you go look into the [[Witchaven Dungeon|shrine]] that the [[Mayor Hobb|mayor]] is so interested in.\n\n[[File:Witchaven dungeon map.png|right|thumb|The dungeon.|393x393px]]\nWalk a little ways west of town, and climb down the stairs to get into the shrine. Once you're inside, look at the [[minimap]]. You can see a red portion of wall indicating where there's a false wall that can be pushed open, and you'll find a new area. Inside are some aggressive level 45 [[giant lobster]]s in a winding tunnel. Walk through it, or take the [[Agility]] [[shortcut]] to get to where there's an [[Imposing Doors|imposing door]] blocking your way. '''Don't try to open it or you will take 5 damage'''. Walk next to it, and [[Savant]] will contact the [[Commorb v2]] to tell you about the strange markings on the door. ''Scan'' the Commorb for her. She can't read them and suggests you take them to [[Jorral]] to try to find out what they mean. '''Pick up the [[dead sea slug]] off the floor''' before leaving and head to Jorral's house, which is located at an [[outpost]] just north-west of [[West Ardougne]].\n\n'''Note:''' Check your quest log whether it has been updated and requires you to go to Jorral; otherwise, open the doors (taking 5 damage) and a replay of your communication with Savant will be played. You can now proceed to Jorral. Make sure you have an extra inventory spot available for the door transcription.\n\n===The pages===\n'''''Items needed:''''' ''[[Swamp paste]], [[dead sea slug]] and five open inventory spaces''{{Map|2434,3350|2439,3350|2439,3346|2438,3346|2438,3343|2434,3343|mtype=polygon|caption=Jorral is found in the outpost due north of West Ardougne.|align=left|width=200|height=200}}\nMake sure you have a free inventory slot, as you will '''not''' get the notes if your inventory is full. Now, go talk to [[Jorral]], who is at his [[Outpost]] (you can use the [[Necklace of passage|Necklace of Passage]] to teleport here, use a spirit tree to get to the Gnome Stronghold and head south). After some coaching from [[Savant]] on what to say, Jorral will translate the message for you. When you leave the building, Savant will contact you again to let you know just what this new revelation entails. \n\nHead back to [[Witchaven]], and report in with [[O'Niall]]. He'll suggest you go talk to the [[Brother Maledict|priest]] and see if he knows anything about how to open the door. As you approach the church, you'll see a brief cutscene of the [[Mayor Hobb|mayor]] leaving the church. When you go in, the priest will be looking rather ill and acting strangely. Ask him about the door, and he'll tell you that he has a book that might be of use, but the three most important pages are missing.\n\nFor the [[Page 1|first one]], go to the mayor's house and look in his [[study desk (The Slug Menace)|desk]]. The [[Page 2|second one]] will be given to you by [[Ezekial Lovecraft]], the owner of the [[Fishing]] store, when you talk to him. For the [[Page 3|last one]], talk to O'Niall again. He too has taken the same look as the rest of the villagers. He'll give you the last page, but unfortunately, it has been ripped into three pieces.\n\nTry to ''use'' [[swamp paste]] on any of the [[Fragment 1|fragments]] to glue the page back together, but [[Savant]] stops you. The oily tar would ruin the ancient parchment, she warns. Instead, she advises, to make sticky glue from a rendered slug, and she mentions that it can only be done by someone who is renowned in seafood cooking.\n\n[[File:The Slug Menace page puzzle.png|thumb|325px|The solution of the puzzle.]]\nTravel to the [[Fishing Platform]] by talking to [[Jeb]], who is next to Holgart. There, talk to [[Bailey]] in the small room on the south-west corner of the platform. Hand him the dead slug you picked up earlier from the shrine, and in a few seconds, he gives you the [[sea slug glue]] you need. Finally, use the glue on the fragments, and a puzzle will pop up.\n\nYou can move the three pieces around using the buttons on the side, turn them, and even flip them over. The easiest way to tell if you've got them all on the right side is that one side is lighter than the other. ''You can look at the solution on the right side of this page.'' After you put the pieces in their correct place, the puzzle will close automatically.\n\n===Crafting the runes===\n'''''Items needed: '''Commorb, 3 pages from previous section, at least 5 rune or pure essence (it is recommended to bring more, using a rune pouch will help manage inventory space), chisel, tiaras/talismans for entering the air, water, fire, earth, and Mind Altars (not necessary if travelling through the [[Abyss]] or using [[Guardians of the Rift]])''\n\n'''''Recommended: '''Fast travel methods to either the five altars, the Abyss, or Guardians of the Rift.''\n\nFor the next part, you'll need a [[chisel]] and at least five [[rune essence|rune]] or [[pure essence]], although it is advised to bring as many as you can hold. Craft the runes into the [[Blank air rune|shapes of air]], [[Blank water rune|water]], [[Blank fire rune|fire]], [[Blank earth rune|earth]], and [[Blank mind rune|mind]] by ''right-clicking'' the [[Page 1|pages]], selecting the options to make the runes. It is likely to fail a few times and break some runes. The odds of success are 43% at level 1 Runecrafting and 99% at level 99 Runecrafting, scaling linearly{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1523556174893023233|date=9 May 2022|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/G6boy|archivedate=19 June 2022|quote=Success is 43% at level 1 RCing, 99% at level 99. Interpolate linearly between those.}}.   '''Do not use the chisel on the essence, or you'll get fragments.''' When finished, you need to ''use'' the shapes' on their respective [[Runecraft#Altars|altars]] (e.g. earth on the [[Earth Altar]]). It is possible to fail empowering the runes, in which case they will also break. Thus, keep your pages, chisel and spare essence handy as you make your way to the various altars. You can travel through the [[Abyss]], Guardians of the Rift, or use a [[talisman]] or [[Tiara (disambiguation)|tiara]] on the following [[mysterious ruins]];\n\n*Air: the [[Air Altar]] is south of [[Falador]].\n*Water: the [[Water Altar]] is south of [[Lumbridge]] (next to the shack to [[Zanaris]]).\n*Earth: the [[Earth Altar]] is north-east of [[Varrock]] (next to the [[Lumber Yard|Lumber yard]]).\n*Fire: the [[Fire Altar]] is on the North-West Corner outside of [[Emir's Arena]] in [[Al Kharid]].\n*Mind: the [[Mind Altar]] is north of [[Falador]] (just below the [[Wilderness]], between the Black Knight's fortress and the Goblin village).\n\n===The imposing door===\n'''''Items needed: '''Commorb, melee weapon, [[Air rune (The Slug Menace)|special air rune]], [[Fire rune (The Slug Menace)|special fire rune]], [[Mind rune (The Slug Menace)|special mind rune]], [[Earth rune (The Slug Menace)|special earth rune]], and [[Water rune (The Slug Menace)|special water rune]]''\n\n[[File:The Slug Menace slug prince.png|left|thumb|200px|The Prince appears!]]Now, head back to [[Witchaven]] to open the [[Imposing Doors|mysterious door]], and prepare for a fight. Go down with the [[Commorb v2]] into the [[Witchaven Dungeon|shrine]] in Witchaven again, and ''use'' your newly created runes on the door in any order. It is revealed that [[Mayor Hobb]] tricked you into opening the door, sealed by the [[White Knights]], so [[Mother Mallum]] could escape.\n{{Listen\n|title = The Slug Prince\n|align = right\n|filename = The Slug Menace - the Slug Prince.ogg\n|desc = The music track that only plays during the encounter with Mayor Hobb.}}\nYou'll have to fight a level 62 [[Slug Prince]].

In the boss fight, if the player had a follower, the prince would not die upon reaching zero [[Hitpoints]] and would continue hitting the player, who could not move or access their inventory, making death inevitable.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1216649258679644161|date=13 January 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.is/UNPeh|archivedate=29 May 2020|quote=It had some pretty bad bugs in 2007. I asked to leave it locked until I'd had a chance to rewrite the climactic cutscene that caused all the player deaths back then. When the prince reached 0 HP, it wouldn't die, but carried on hitting the player, and the player couldn't move or access their inventory, so they'd likely end up dying. The dev and his supervisor couldn't diagnose it for days, and didn't escalate it to anyone who could. If you're wondering how that happened, it's because the dev wrote the cutscene in a unique way, trying to stop the player clicking out, so the player was frozen and had their inventory blocked by the cutscene behaviour, and the cutscene malfunctioned if the player had a pet.}}\n*[[Mayor Hobb]]'s clothes become a bright shade of pink during the cutscene in which he visits Brother Maledict to possess him.\n*[[Col. Jake O'Niall]] may be a reference to <i>{{wp|Stargate}}</i>'s {{wp|Jack O'Neill|Col. Jack O'Neill}}; both seem to have an affinity for fishing. Jake is also \"semi\" retired (while still retaining security clearance), as Jack was several times throughout the show. Jake also gets possessed by a [[sea slug]], which seems to be an obvious reference to the {{wp|Goa'uld}}, a parasitic race of worm-like aliens that take over a host completely. Additionally, when talking to Mayor Hobb for the first time, the player questions how he knows his name, from which follows a conversation that is a direct reference to the ''Stargate SG-1'' episode \"{{wp|Window of Opportunity (Stargate SG-1)|Window of Opportunity}}\".\n*In addition to the obvious ''Stargate'' references, when the Mayor leaves the church and says: \"Welcome to the family\", it may be a reference to the Slitheen Family from ''Doctor Who''.\n*[[Ezekial]]'s last name is a reference to the famous American author of horror, fantasy and science fiction, {{wp|H. P. Lovecraft|Howard Phillips Lovecraft}}. Ezekial mentions his family have always been either bait sellers or writers, and mentions his relative Howard. This is further confirmed by the nature of the quests he's involved in.\n*Instead of \"Trade\", like all other shop owners, Ezekial has a right-click option \"Shop\" that opens the shop's window.\n*Ezekial's favourite food is [[tuna]], which is made clear in <i>{{RSL|RuneScape 3}}</i>'s {{RSL|Salt in the Wound|Salt in the Wound}}, for when fed any tuna-related item (such as a [[tuna potato]]) he will exclaim \"Tuna! My favourite!\" and is healed a much higher amount of Hitpoints than normal.\n*The scarf around Maledict's neck gets a gold trim when he is possessed.\n*Col. O'Niall makes a military in-joke: 'Don't Sir me, boy, I work for a living'. This refers to petty/warrant officers in the military who, while technically being officers, don't hold a royal commission. The joke being that officers with a commission are just management roles and don't do any of the actual work. This is also a quote from the 1981 movie ''{{wp|Stripes (film)| Stripes}}''.\n*The quest is a reference to the movie ''{{wp|The Faculty}}''.\n*A short unused music track called [[Seaslug Sailing Journey]] can be found in the game files, which at one point in development was presumably intended to be played while ferrying to the fishing platform.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{The Slug Menace}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Slug Menace, The}}"

    "description": "Our story begins with you, the hero, answering the call to adventure when Edmond, a resident of Ardougne, asks for your aid. By rescuing his daughter Elena from Plague City, the quarantined West Ardougne, you begin to unravel the mystery surrounding the disease. With her help, you discover the plague is a hoax - a plot by King Lathas to section off the West Ardougne. By confronting him, you find out this was done to protect the rest of Gielinor from the threat in the elven lands.\n\nThe king sends you on a mission to travel through the Underground Pass and help his ally, Lord Iorwerth, in eradicating his brother King Tyras who threatens to revive the mysterious Dark Lord. After an arduous journey through the pass, you meet with Iorwerth and his forces to end Tyras' evil once and for all.\n\nUpon your return to Lathas you are intercepted by Arianwyn, a rebel elf who opposes Lord Iorwerth.

The quest was announced at [[RuneFest|RuneFest 2018]] and was released on [[25 July]] [[2019]]. Completion of the quest unlocks access to the elven city of [[Prifddinas]].\n\nThe quest follows up on the events of [[Mourning's End Part II]]. With the [[Temple of Light]] now sealed for another thousand years, the player joins the rebel elves in exposing the [[Biohazard|hoax of the plague]] and starting a revolution against [[Lord Iorwerth]] and [[King Lathas]].\n\n==Details== \n{{Quest details\n|start = Talk to [[Edmond]], who can be found at his home in East Ardougne, north of the [[Flying Horse Inn]].\n|startmap = 2569,3333\n|difficulty = Grandmaster\n|description = Our story begins with you, the hero, answering the call to adventure when Edmond, a resident of Ardougne, asks for your aid. By rescuing his daughter Elena from Plague City, the quarantined West Ardougne, you begin to unravel the mystery surrounding the disease. With her help, you discover the plague is a hoax - a plot by King Lathas to section off the West Ardougne. By confronting him, you find out this was done to protect the rest of Gielinor from the threat in the elven lands.\n\nThe king sends you on a mission to travel through the Underground Pass and help his ally, Lord Iorwerth, in eradicating his brother King Tyras who threatens to revive the mysterious Dark Lord. After an arduous journey through the pass, you meet with Iorwerth and his forces to end Tyras' evil once and for all.\n\nUpon your return to Lathas you are intercepted by Arianwyn, a rebel elf who opposes Lord Iorwerth. He informs you of Lathas and Iorwerth's deception. They manipulated you into removing their final opposition and were now free to bring the Dark Lord back to Gielinor for their own intentions. You work with the elven rebellion to discover the purpose of the plague was to disguise the digsite of the long lost Temple of Light.

You can grab your [[mourner gear]] and a [[tinderbox]] to save time.|recommended=[[Stamina potion]], [[Weight-reducing clothing]], [[Ardougne teleport]], [[West ardougne teleport]]}}\n[[File:Edmond chathead.png|left]]\n\nTo begin the quest talk to [[Edmond]], who can be found in the garden at his home in [[East Ardougne]] north of the [[Flying Horse Inn]]. (You can pick up a cabbage and spade in Edmond's garden if needed). He will tell you that [[Elena]] has been going around telling people that the plague isn't real, and has been taken by the Knights of Ardougne who claimed she was inciting rebellion against the king. Agree to help, and seek out [[King Lathas]] upstairs in his castle just south.\n\nSpeak to King Lathas while not wearing Mourner gear. He will tell you that Elena was imprisoned due to spreading news that the plague is fake and as he has explained before, the façade is a necessary evil and he simply can't risk Elena exposing the truth and risking everything, including the looming threat that is the [[Dark Lord]], and thus must keep her imprisoned.\n\nReturn to Edmond. The player tells him about everything they've done since the events of the [[Plague City]] quest, summing up the entire questline. He will then tell you that Elena is imprisoned in the city prison beneath the castle, and asks you to go undercover as a [[Knight of Ardougne]] and find a way to free her.\n\nYou will need a [[steel full helm]], [[steel platebody]], [[steel platelegs]], [[red dye]], [[purple dye]] and one piece of [[silk]]. Use the red dye on the steel full helm to obtain an [[Ardougne knight helm]], and then talk to his wife, [[Alrena]]. You will receive a [[Ardougne knight tabard|tabard]] from her; use it on the steel platebody to obtain an [[Ardougne knight platebody]]. Equip your helm, platebody and steel platelegs. Pures who do not have 5 Defence and are unable to equip [[steel platelegs]] must talk to Edmond to polish the steel platelegs into [[Ardougne knight platelegs]].\n\nTalk to Edmond again. He will tell you to go to the prison, which is located beneath the castle.\n[[File:Song of the Elves - talking to Elena.png|thumb|250px|Speaking to Elena in the city prison.]]\nGo to the basement of the [[Ardougne Castle]]. Here, a guard will stop you. You will tell him your name is Tim, Sue, or Sam, and be allowed to continue. Talk to [[Elena]] in the prison; she will tell you she wants to escape through a grate into the [[Ardougne Sewers]], and needs you to fetch her some [[Clear liquid|sulphuric acid]] to [[Broken Grate|dissolve]] the grate, which you can find in a [[cabinet (Song of the Elves)|cabinet]] in her home. Go to her house, which is found east of Edmond's house directly next to the log balance. Search the cabinet and select the '''thick clear liquid''', and you'll receive a vial of [[clear liquid]].\n\nAfter you bring the sulphuric acid to Elena, go back and talk to Edmond while she escapes. He will tell you she already came by and is hiding to avoid being recaptured, but tells you that she is hiding in the [[The Rehnison household|Rehnison household]] in [[West Ardougne]]. The Rehnisons' house is located directly west of the [[Mourner's Headquarters]]. Talk to [[Ted Rehnison]], or his wife [[Martha Rehnison|Martha]], who will tell you the resistance is waiting in the basement below. Search the eastern bed and climb down.\n[[File:Song of the Elves - the Ardougne Resistance.png|thumb|250px|The Ardougne Resistance.]]\nElena will tell you about the Ardougne Resistance, which she founded after discovering the plague is a hoax in order to overthrow King Lathas, and you will tell her about what you've been up to while infiltrating the mourners. [[Councillor Halgrive]] will then speak to you. He will tell you that although the council serves the king and can't overrule his decisions, they can step in as interim ruler should the king be deemed unfit to rule. Councillor Halgrive tells you of his plan to have you (disguised as a Knight of Ardougne) upset the people of Ardougne in order to make it appear as if you're doing so under the king's orders.\n\n==Causing an insurrection==\n{{Needed|[[Ardougne knight armour]], [[mourner gear]], [[tinderbox]]|recommended=[[Stamina potion]], [[prayer potion]], [[armour]], [[weapon]], [[food]]}}\n\nYou will need to go around [[West Ardougne|West]] and [[East Ardougne]] doing certain actions to rile up the population. Each action will convert members to the Ardougne Resistance. Keep in mind you do not have to talk to every person on this list; you just need to convert a total of 80 members.\n\nIn '''West Ardougne''', dress up as a [[mourner gear|mourner]] and do the following to make the population angry:\n[[File:Song of the Elves - setting food on fire.png|thumb|250px|Setting food on fire to generate discord among the people.]]\n{{Checklist|\n*Talk to the [[Priest (West Ardougne)|priest]] and ask for taxes (+6)\n*Set the grain sacks on fire inside the [[West Ardougne#church|church]] (+8)\n*Tell [[Nurse Sarah]] in the south-west corner of the city behind the church about retraining (south-west of Church) (+6)\n*Set the grain sacks on fire outside the [[West Ardougne General Store|general store]] (+8)\n*Talk to [[Chadwell]] in the general store and tell him about new taxes (+4)\n*Set the grain sacks on fire in the central Civic Office, next to the [[clerk]] (+8)\n}}\n\nIn '''East Ardougne''', dress up as an [[Knight of Ardougne#Trivia|Ardougne Knight]] and do the following:\n[[File:Song of the Elves - announcing taxes.png|thumb|250px|Announcing taxes to a silver merchant.]]\n{{Checklist|\n*Talk to all the people on the market square, '''including the town crier''', and tell them about new taxes;\n**[[Silk merchant]] (+2)\n**West [[Baker]] (+4)\n**East [[Baker]] (+4)\n**[[Silver merchant]] (+2)\n**[[Gem merchant]] (+2)\n**[[Fur trader]] (+2)\n**[[Spice seller]] (+2)\n**[[Town Crier]] (+8)\n*Talk to [[Zenesha]] (the armour store owner south of the square) about the new taxes (+3)\n*Talk to the [[estate agent]] and tell him about the new taxes (+2)\n*Talk to [[Probita]] (Pet Store) about taxes (+2)\n*Talk to [[Kortan]] or [[Aemad]] in the general store about taxes (+4)\n*Talk to the [[Priest (East Ardougne)|priest]] in the church about the new taxes (+6)\n*Talk to [[Doctor Orbon]] in the church about retraining (+6)\n*Talk to [[Richard (Ardougne)|Richard]] at the farm north of Ardougne about the new taxes (+4)\n*Set the grain sacks on fire outside the farm north of Ardougne (+4)\n*Talk to the [[Bartender (Flying Horse Inn)|Bartender]] at the [[Flying Horse Inn]], just north of the castle about the new taxes (+6)\n*Set the fish barrels on fire at the Ardougne docks (+4)}}\n\nAfter you have recruited 80 new members, bank to prepare yourself for the first fight of the quest.\n\n{{Instance}}\n\nOnce ready for the fight, return to the [[Rehnison Household]] in West Ardougne. Enter the basement under the bed and talk to [[Elena]] to begin the battle of West Ardougne.\n[[File:Song of the Elves - Battle of West Ardougne.png|thumb|250px|The resistance fight the mourners of West Ardougne.]]\nThe fight has three parts. Each part has a kill counter in the chatbox and resistance fighters will help you in combat. [[Protect from Melee]] will protect you from all damage, but high-levelled players will find that decent armour will protect them from most damage. Alternatively, [[Guthan the Infested's equipment]] can be used, needing no [[food]] or [[prayer]] to complete. Mages can also use the cornering trick to stack the mobs and burst or barrage them for faster kills. Furthermore, despite some of the mourners wielding crystal halberds, they have an attack range of 1, so they can be safely trapped on corners and safespotted.\n\nIn the first part, you have to kill 10 [[Mourner (Song of the Elves)|Mourners]]:\n*Level 24 (3)\n*Level 51 (5)\n*Level 106 (2)\n\nIn the second part, head downstairs via the trapdoor and kill 11 Mourners:\n*Level 24 (3)\n*Level 51 (4)\n*Level 106 (4)\n\nNote: if you leave the battle having reached the second part, when you return you will be downstairs and not have to kill the initial 10 Mourners.\n\nAfter the second part, the fight pauses and you can bank and resupply if necessary. Talk to Elena or [[Councillor Halgrive]] to commence the battle of East Ardougne. Some of the NPCs are on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}}.\n*[[Knight of Ardougne (Song of the Elves)|Knight of Ardougne]] (level 27) (5)\n*[[Paladin (Song of the Elves)|Paladin]] (level 49) (6)\n*Knight of Ardougne (level 53) (2)\n*Paladin (level 121) (2)\n\nAfter you've killed all the guards of [[King Lathas]], you will see a cut-scene, where the resistance fighters bring King Lathas out, who they find hidden in a wardrobe. Players can speak to the king and ask him the reasons for his actions over the course of the quest series. In the end, he is sentenced to death by the citizens of Ardougne. After the execution, [[Hooded Figure]]s will knock you out and take you to the [[Iorwerth Camp]].\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nSong of the Elves - Battle of East Ardougne.png|The resistance fight the knights and paladins of East Ardougne.\nSong of the Elves - the King falls.png|Lathas is captured by the resistance.\nSong of the Elves - the King's death.png|Lathas is sentenced to death.\n</gallery>\n\n==Arianwyn's plan==\n[[File:Song of the Elves - captured by Iorwerth.png|thumb|left|250px|The player and Elena are brought before Lord Iorwerth.]]\n[[File:Song of the Elves - Arianwyn rescues player.png|thumb|250px|Arianwyn comes to the player's rescue.]]\nA long cutscene will play, where you and [[Elena]] are brought before [[Lord Iorwerth]]. Before you both are about to be taken prisoner, [[Arianwyn]] and the elf resistance will appear to rescue you. Lord Iorwerth will reveal that he lied to [[King Lathas]] in order to access [[West Ardougne]] and reach the [[Temple of Light]] to summon [[Seren]]. Arianwyn refutes this, believing Seren to be dead; Lord Iorwerth thought the same, until he managed to break one of the seals in the [[Grand Library]], where he discovered a part of Seren remains trapped within the Temple. He will let the rebels go, believing they could be of use in their plans while they are none the wiser.\n\nReturning to [[Lletya]], Arianwyn calls a meeting, and asks you to notify [[Ysgawyn]] and Elena. You must talk to Ysgawyn first before Elena will appear. Ysgawyn can be found on the upper platform of Lletya; speak to him first. After you have done this Elena can be found in the south-west corner by the pond. After talking to Elena, return to Arianwyn and talk to him to begin the meeting.\n\nThe meeting will tell of the history of the elves from the end of the [[God Wars]] to the ongoing civil war, where the city of [[Prifddinas]] was reverted to a crystal seed, and the Grand Library along with it, which Lord Iorwerth claimed he accessed. It is decided that the player and Arianwyn will investigate the [[Waterfall Dungeon]] to see whether [[King Baxtorian]] left anything behind that would explain more about the fragment of Seren.\n\nBe sure to speak to Arianwyn after the meeting, or he will not appear at [[Baxtorian Falls]].\n\n==Visiting Baxtorian Falls==\n{{Needed|[[Nature rune]], [[rope]], [[flowers]] from [[mithril|mithril seeds]] or [[adamant seeds]] or [[irit]] leaf, [[cabbage]], [[Wine of Zamorak]] or [[Zamorak brew|Zamorak brew(4)]], [[adamant chainbody]], [[black knife]] or [[black dagger]]|recommended=[[Games necklace]], [[teleport crystal]] (to get back to [[Lletya]])}}\n\nTravel to the [[Waterfall Dungeon]] (requires a [[rope]]). Go to the eastern room with the [[skeletons]] and [[skeleton mage]]s and search the northern stacked crate for [[A key (Waterfall Dungeon)|a key]], and then go to the western room with [[fire giant]]s and past the two single doors. Talk to [[Arianwyn]], and he will hand you a book, [[Ode to eternity]], with a riddle, that requires you to use items on the pillars around the tomb.\n\n'''{{Colour|red|Warning:}} If you place the items on the incorrect pillars, you will have to buy/collect the items again, and each time you enter the room, the order of numbers will change! If you leave the room before finishing the puzzle, you may be able to continue it or replace the item on the pillar you did incorrectly.'''\n\n[[File:Song of the Elves - Baxtorian's riddle pillar labelled.png|thumb|250px|Labelled pillars.]]\n[[File:Song of the Elves - Baxtorian lives.png|thumb|250px|Baxtorian is freed from stone.]]\n\nEach of the six items has a number as follows:\n# [[Nature rune]]\n# [[Flowers]] from [[mithril|mithril seeds]] or [[adamant seeds]], or an [[irit leaf]]\n# [[Black knife]] or [[black dagger]]\n# [[Wine of Zamorak]] or [[Zamorak brew|Zamorak brew(4)]]\n# [[Adamant chainbody]]\n# [[Cabbage]]\n\nThe layout is random, and you will need to inspect the pillars to figure out the order. '''Make sure to read the book before placing any items'''.\n\n*The south-west pillar will say which number it is. Place the item corresponding to this number on the south-west pillar.\n*The west pillar will say it is not opposite of a number. Place the item corresponding to this number on the south-east pillar.\n*The north-west pillar will say the number it is next to. This number corresponds to the item to place on the west pillar.\n*The north-east pillar will say the number it is opposite to. This number corresponds to the item to place on the north-west pillar.\n*The east pillar will say what number it is not next to. This number corresponds to the item to place on the east pillar.\n*The south-east pillar will say what number '''isn't''' going on the pillar. This number corresponds to the item to place on the north-east pillar.\n\nAfter placing all of the items in the right locations, the statue of Baxtorian will spring to life, as [[Baxtorian]] himself. Arianwyn will teleport Baxtorian back to [[Lletya]]. Bank to gather items for the next section and then teleport back to Lletya yourself.\n\n==Preparing to enter Prifddinas==\n{{Needed|[[Cadantine seed]], [[seed dibber]], [[runite bar]], [[hammer]], [[pickaxe]], [[pestle and mortar]], [[vial of water]]|recommended=[[Antipoison]], [[teleport crystal]] (only if searching for Lord Amlodd before Lady Trahaearn)}}\n\nBack in [[Lletya]], talk to [[Baxtorian]] and [[Arianwyn]]. Baxtorian says there may be a way to enter the [[Grand Library]] of [[Prifddinas]], to learn more about what [[Lord Iorwerth]] was planning, via the use of a specially made potion and bypassing the city walls, which have been enchanted so that only Iorwerth elves and their allies can enter; Baxtorian believes [[Lord Amlodd]], an expert in magic, would be able to break the spell.\n\nYou will be asked to create the potion. Talk to [[Elena]] next to the pond, and plant a [[cadantine seed]] in the nearby farming patch, which is specially treated to yield [[elder cadantine]]. Elena will ask you to check if Arianwyn and Baxtorian have anything for you to do while you wait for the seed to grow.\n[[File:Isafdar map.png|alt=Isafdar map|thumb|A map of the area, showing possible routes and the locations of the traps.]]\nSince much of the rest of the quest takes place in the elven lands with their many traps, it is recommended to have an anti-poison potion available, since tripwires if failed will poison the player.\n\nTalk to [[Baxtorian]] and ask how to find [[Lord Amlodd]] and [[Lady Trahaearn]]. Ask how to find both elves before proceeding to save yourself time; the order in which the two are found does not matter. [[Lady Trahaearn]] gave the clue \"I will journey south from the well\" to [[Baxtorian]] before she left. [[Lord Amlodd]] gave [[Baxtorian]] a special [[crystal seed]] for safekeeping, which he gives to you.\n\nTalk to [[Eluned]] (found in south-west [[Lletya]], north of the patch where you planted the [[cadantine]]) to ask her to enchant the crystal seed before proceeding with the quest.\n\n'''Note: If you choose to search for Lady Trahaearn before Lord Amlodd, you will not need to bring a teleport crystal with you, since Lord Amlodd will automatically teleport you back to Lletya after speaking to him.'''\n\n===Finding Lady Trahaearn===\n[[File:Song of the Elves - waking Lady Trahaearn.png|thumb|250px|Lady Trahaearn is awakened.]]\nTravel west of [[Lletya]] and pass through the trees north of the [[dire wolves]]. Then run across the clearing, step over the tripwire, and head west through the 3 dense forests. Travel north through the leaf trap, and finally east to reach the cave entrance to the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]]. Inside, walk south of the [[Well of Voyage]] to inspect the blocked crevice. Afterwards, use your [[pickaxe]] on the blocked crevice to clear it and go inside. Upon entering, you'll find an Elderly Elf wearing a damaged exoskeleton. Use a [[runite bar]] and [[hammer]] on her to fix the exoskeleton. She will then be revealed to be Lady Trahaearn, and will teleport back to Lletya.\n\nNow, you should rub the crystal seed you received from Baxtorian and had enchanted by Eluned to find Lord Amlodd. However, if you chose to look for Lord Amlodd first, then return to Lletya, either on foot or with a [[teleport crystal]] (if you brought one), to make the potion.\n\n===Finding Lord Amlodd===\nAfter rubbing the crystal seed (make sure you had it enchanted first), you will be teleported to the [[Enchanted Valley]] where you find a [[Lord Amlodd#Mysterious Figure|Mysterious Figure]], who will ask for your opinion on the state of the valley. Choose any of the available options and the Mysterious Figure will reveal that he is Lord Amlodd. He will then teleport you back to Lletya.\n\n===Making the potion===\nOnce Lord Amlodd and Lady Trahaearn have been found, talk to [[Elena]] again and get the [[elder cadantine]]. Talk to [[Arianwyn]] to get the [[Crystal (Song of the Elves)|old crystal]], and use it with a [[pestle and mortar]] to make [[Crystal dust (Song of the Elves)|crystal dust]]. Use the elder cadantine on a [[vial of water]], and then use the crystal dust with the unfinished potion to make the [[inversion potion]].\n\nTalk to Arianwyn and give him the potion, and a meeting will begin in which it is decided who enters the Grand Library. [[Ysgawyn]] will disagree, while everyone else believes you are up to the task. Talk to [[Lord Amlodd]] (located north from Arianwyn) once more to teleport to the [[Grand Library]].\n\n==The Grand Library of Prifddinas==\n(Before you enter the library, take note that any unlocked memories can teleport you to other unlocked seal locations if you ask it where else you can be teleported to. You must have already heard the memory in order to teleport to it, simply solving the light puzzle doesn't enable the teleport. This can help with saving some run energy as you travel around the library.)\n{{:Song of the Elves/Warped Library guide}}\n\n==Finding Lord Crwys and Lady Hefin==\n{{Needed|An [[axe]]|recommended=[[Iorwerth camp teleport]], [[antipoison]], [[teleport crystal]], [[weight-reducing clothing]].}}\n{{Map|height=200|width=200|2182,3208|mtype=square|r=3|align=right|caption=The location of Lord Crwys.}}\nReturn to [[Arianwyn]] in [[Lletya]], who will call everyone to a meeting to hear your discoveries in the [[Grand Library]]. Everyone will be shocked by the revelations, except for [[Ysgawyn]], who accuses you of lying and demands you to be taken away in chains. However, [[Baxtorian]] believes you and lets you continue reporting your discoveries. With Arianwyn still in shock, he will ask Baxtorian to temporarily lead. Ysgawyn will search for the [[Orb of light (Song of the Elves)|orb of light]] on [[Gorlah]]. In the meanwhile, you will be told to search for [[Lord Crwys]] and [[Lady Hefin]]. As before, ask Baxtorian for the clue on how to find each of them.\n[[File:Song of the Elves - the Elf Hermit.png|thumb|left|250px|The player finds an Elf Hermit.]]\n\n===Finding Lady Hefin===\nLady Hefin gave Baxtorian the clue \"I will walk across the water to the south\" before her departure. Leave the village through the trees west, and then run south past where the [[magic trees]] are located; continue further south and jump across a trail of stepping stones over the tar lake until you reach a small island with an NPC and tent. Talk to the [[Elf Hermit]], who is actually Lady Hefin. After a short conversation, Lady Hefin teleports away.\n\n===Finding Lord Crwys===\nLord Crwys gave Baxtorian the clue \"The trees of my home will call to me\" before his departure. He will be found south of the [[Iorwerth Camp]] (refer to image above), on the western side of [[Isafdar]]. Make your way to the Elf Camp - using an [[Iorwerth camp teleport]] scroll is recommended. Note that the Iorwerth elves will attack you on sight. Cross the log balance and head southwest. You will pass a stick trap to enter the clearing, and then chop the dead tree north-west of the lake (or west of the trap) to free him. '''Note:''' You will not be able to cut the tree if you do not ask Baxtorian where to find him.\n\nNow, return back to Lletya and speak to Baxtorian, and after a short cut scene and dialogue, the other NPC's will leave. '''Note:''' You will not be able to enter the cave in the next part if you do not talk to Baxtorian.\n\n==Recovering the orb==\n{{Needed|[[Armour]] and [[weapons]]|recommended=[[Food]] and [[prayer potions]] (if low level), charged [[teleport crystal]] to return quickly, [[Iorwerth camp teleport]]}}\n\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Song of the Elves - fight for the orb of light.png|thumb|250px|Fighting the Iorwerth Warrior and Archer]]\n\nHead to the [[Iorwerth Camp]]. Be wary of the elves at the camp, as they'll attack you on sight, and enter the cave at the north end of the camp. Once inside, after a short dialogue, kill the [[Iorwerth Warrior]] and [[Iorwerth Archer|Archer]]. If possible, trap the warrior behind the archer; if that is not possible, then use [[Protect from Melee]] and kill the warrior first before focusing on the ranger.\n\nAfter killing the elves, claim the [[Orb of light (Song of the Elves)|orb of light]] from the [[Chest (Song of the Elves)|chest]] and return back to [[Lletya]]; then, speak with [[Baxtorian]].\n\n==Tracking down Ysgawyn==\n{{Needed|recommended=[[Food]] and [[Antipoison]], gear and items for The attack on Lletya}}\n\n'''Note:''' It is recommended to charge your [[teleport crystal]]s now if you're running low, since the area becomes [[instanced]] later on and you cannot do this until much later.\n\n[[Baxtorian]] asks you in private to find [[Ysgawyn]], who has been acting suspiciously. He tells you [[Elena]], who is by the pond and patch where you planted the [[cadantine seed]] earlier, was the last person who saw him, and advises you to speak to her. During the conversation, select the second option, and she will tell you that she doesn't know where he went, but tells you that might be possible to search for tracks by the entrance to [[Lletya]]. It's strongly recommended to bring some food and Anti-poison for the next part as you will be avoiding the traps through the forest.\n[[File:Song of the Elves - Ysgawyn is accused.png|thumb|250px|The player accuses Ysgawyn of betraying the rebel elves.]]\nHead west out the village entrance, through the \"pass tree\" and inspect the [[rock (Song of the Elves)|mossy rock]] or [[mushroom (Song of the Elves)|mushroom]] (be careful of level-88 [[dire wolves]]). This will start the tracking sequence, similar to hunting [[kebbit]]s.\n\n# Continue following the tracks and inspect the rocks just before the trip wire for the second set of tracks.\n# Hop over the trip wire and inspect the southern inspect rock option for the third set of tracks leading across the leaves trap.\n# Head south and inspect the [[elven lamp (Song of the Elves)|elven lamp]] for the fourth set of tracks.\n# Follow the tracks south-west and inspect the mushrooms north of the large rock.\n# Follow the path and inspect the small rock north-east of where the tracks end for the fifth final set of tracks leading over the trip wire, where you will see Iestin and Ysgawyn.\n# Click on either NPC to continue the dialogue. ('''Note:''' If you do not have an inventory of very good food, such as [[sharks]] or higher, return back to a [[bank]], as you will need it, and some [[prayer potions]] if low level.)\n\nYou will witness a conversation with Ysgawyn, and accuse him of being a traitor. However, he will angrily tell you that he is speaking to his informant within the [[Iorwerth clan]], [[Iestin Edern]], who provided Ysgawyn with the information about the [[Orb of light (Song of the Elves)|orb of light]], among other things. This was kept a secret from the other elves by Iestin's request, who feared that the other rebels may not be trusting of him; you will have two options to select before continuing the dialogue, before you are teleported into a cutscene, which will continue below.\n\nIestin will then inform both of you that earlier in the day, [[Lord Iorwerth]] has discovered Lletya via a traitor among the rebel elves, and told him how to find the village, and that [[Essyllt]] is preparing their forces as they speak.\n\n==The attack on Lletya==\n{{Needed|Combat equipment|recommended=[[Food]] and [[prayer potion]] (if low level), emergency teleport, charged [[teleport crystal]] to return quickly}}\n{{Instance|irs=Rebel Scout|cost=80000}}\n[[File:Song of the Elves - attack on Lletya.png|thumb|250px|Lletya is under attack!]]\n[[Lord Iorwerth]] has invaded the town of [[Lletya]] and is wreaking havoc. After a brief cutscene with [[Ysgawyn]], [[Iestin]] and [[Elena]], you are tasked with saving two children from one of the burning buildings. Head south into the building and search the various objects on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} and {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} (locations vary from player to player) to find the two missing children (tables, sacks, benches, cooking pots etc.). The large flames will restrict locations you are not supposed to go through. '''Note:''' There is an escape barricade located west of the instance if you wish to restock food, as you will not be able to do this before the boss fight with Level-212 Arianwyn.\n\nAfter saving the kids, a cut-scene will follow where Lord Iorwerth reveals that Arianwyn was the traitor, who turned once he discovered they truly wish to return [[Seren]], and forces [[Baxtorian]] to hand over the [[Orb of light (Song of the Elves)|Orb of Light]] in order to save one of the children. Enraged, Ysgawyn attacks Essyllt, who kills him instantly. After a short dialogue and cut-scene, you will now have to fight [[Arianwyn]] in order to go after the orb once again.\n\nThe moment you enter the [[instance]], use [[Protect from Missiles]] prayer. Hit-and-run tactics work best with attacking Arianwyn with [[melee gear]]. Observe the colour of his arrows. His arrows consistently hit in the 30s.[[File:Song of the Elves - fighting Arianwyn.png|thumb|250px|Fighting the traitor Arianwyn.]]\nArianwyn cycles through '''three''' ranged attacks:\n*A <u>green arrow</u> is a regular attack which can be negated with Protect from Missiles.\n*The <u>orange arrow</u> is a high damage explosive attack, but it is slow moving and can be avoided by moving one step away.\n*The <u>purple arrow</u> disables active prayers.\n\nAfter the battle, you will watch another cut-scene in which the surviving elves hold a funeral for Ysgawyn, and decide on what to do next. [[Islwyn]] will then ask Baxtorian about what Lord Iorwerth tried telling the rebel elves, and reveals the truth - when Baxtorian discovered where his wife was, he sent what little remained of his army to rescue her, knowing it was a trap but sending them to their deaths anyway due to his desperation to see his wife once more. Enraged, Islwyn leaves for the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]], intending to fight the [[Iorwerth Clan|Iorwerth]] on his own.\n\nDuring the conversation, Baxtorian will reveal the two clues when you select the options for the last two elders - [[Lady Ithell]] and [[Lady Meilyr]]- and gives you a [[Clue scroll (Song of the Elves)|clue scroll]]; head to the bank to restock on the items required for the next part.\n\n==Finding Lady Ithell and Lady Meilyr==\n{{Needed|[[Spade]], 8 [[limestone brick]]s, [[saw]], [[hammer]]|recommended=[[Anti-poison]], [[stamina potions]], [[fairy ring]] access, charged [[teleport crystal]] to [[Lletya]], [[Iorwerth camp teleport]], or [[Catherby teleport]] and 800&ndash;3,200 coins for a [[charter ship]], [[Zul-Andra teleport]]}}\n\n===Lady Ithell===\nAsk how to find [[Lady Ithell]]. She gave the clue \"I'll put my soul into my greatest work\" before her death. You must walk around [[Lletya]] and locate the '''five''' [[symbol (Song of the Elves)|symbols]] on the walls of the buildings. The symbols are white and glowing, and easy to spot. They are located both upstairs and downstairs:\n[[File:Song of the Elves - Ithell symbols.png|thumb|250px|The symbols found around the village.]]\n*The '''first''' symbol is up the northern ladder directly above where the group meetings have been taking place. Enter the room with the [[prayer altar]]. The symbol is on the wall as you enter the room on the left of the doorway.\n*Leaving that symbol, head north around the upper level to the ladder in the room (upper level of the general store). The '''second''' symbol is on the northern wall between two chairs.\n*Head down the ladder behind you into the [[Lletya General Store|general store]]. The '''third''' symbol is on the wall to the eastern side of the shop, south of the table and south-west of the exit.\n*Leave the general store and head south through the ruined town to the archery shop. The '''fourth''' symbol is on the wall in the corner north of the table.\n*The final '''fifth''' symbol is inside the bank in the east tucked away just to the right behind the bank deposit box.\n\nOnce all the symbols have been touched, you will gain some of Lady Ithell's knowledge, and you must build a [[well (Lletya)#Statue|statue]] on the [[Statue Space (Song of the Elves)|statue space]] in the centre of the village (next to the water icon on the map) with a [[saw]], [[hammer]] and eight [[limestone brick]]s (Flamtaer bag does not work). Upon building the statue and a short dialogue, [[Kelyn]] will gaze at the statue and gain all of Lady Ithell's knowledge, now becoming Lady Kelyn Ithell, before teleporting away. Return back to [[Baxtorian]] and ask for clues to Lady Meilyr in order to continue with the quest (if not already done).\n\n===Lady Meilyr===\n{{Map|mtype=pin|2225,3133|caption=The location of the first coordinate clue step to find Lady Meilyr|align=right|width=250|height=250|icon=cyanPin}}\nMake sure you have enough inventory space to unequip all of your equipment before continuing. Ask how to find [[Lady Meilyr]]. She gave the clue \"Follow the scrolls to find me\" before her departure. [[Baxtorian]] will hand the player a [[Clue scroll (Song of the Elves)|clue scroll]] with a coordinate clue. It points to a location south-east of the [[Tyras Camp]], near a [[yew tree]]; the quickest way is to teleport to [[Catherby]] and use the [[trader crewmember]] on the pier to head to the [[Tyras Camp]] Port for 800&ndash;3,200 coins (depending on [[Ring of charos]] and [[Cabin Fever]]). Once there, head through the camp and head north through the dense forest, then east and south through the next set of dense forest south of the grizzly bear/cub, and hop over either trip wire trap and south to the dig spot (4 tiles south of the triple mushroom cluster). \n\nNote: if you have never done treasure trails before, you may fail to dig up the next clue scroll even if you are standing on the correct spot. If this happens try asking the [[Observatory professor]] about treasure trails to obtain a [[sextant]], [[watch]] and [[chart]]. Destroy the Clue scroll that you have, get a new one from [[Baxtorian]] and try again.\n\nThe next clue step requires travelling to [[Zul-Andra]]. A Zul-Andra teleport will take you right there; another quick way to get there is using the [[fairy ring]] {{fairycode|BJS}}, although you will need 76 [[Agility]] to use the stepping stone shortcut (can be boosted with [[summer pie]]s). Otherwise, you may move onward to [[Port tyras|Port Tyras]], go through the camp and head south from the docks, or use a [[trader crewmember]] to charter a ship to the [[Tyras Camp]] Port for 800&ndash;3,200 coins (depending on [[Ring of charos]] and [[Cabin Fever]]) and head south from there. Once there, venture to the south-east. On the east side of the northernmost hut, dig two steps north of the inconspicuous hole, or the [[STASH]] unit if players have built it, for the third clue scroll.\n\nThe third step is: \"''DEAD ROASTING UPSHIFTS''\", which is an anagram for \"''PRIFDDINAS SOUTH GATES''\". To progress, dig next to the southern city gate of [[Prifddinas]]; players can quickly reach it via an [[Iorwerth camp teleport]] then going east through dense forests then north towards the southern gate. Dig one square north of the north-eastern elven lamp for the last clue scroll.\n\nThe final step requires you to spin outside the entrance to the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] in eastern [[Isafdar]] with nothing equipped. Head south across the bridge and follow the route, after which, you head north across the northern leaves trap and then further east towards the cave entrance. Once players spin, Lady Ffion Meilyr will appear for a short dialogue before departing. Use your [[teleport crystal]] to head to Lletya to bank/restock.\n\n==Sealing the Underground Pass==\n{{Needed|One free inventory spot|recommended=Combat equipment, [[food]], [[prayer potion]]s and at least one [[super restore]] for battle with [[Essyllt]], emergency/bank [[teleport]], [[anti-poison]], [[stamina potion]]. Note: Tanking the battle and teleporting out after is a viable method}}\n{{Instance|irs=Rebel Scout|cost=80000}}\n[[File:Song of the Elves - the Temple blockade.png|thumb|250px|The rebel elves, ready to defend the entrance to the Temple of Light.]]\n\nHead for the dwarven camp in the Underground Pass. It can be reached easily by taking [[Abyss|The Abyss]] to the Death Altar, exiting the altar and taking the tunnel on the western wall outside the altar (although your prayer points will be drained) or walking from [[Lletya]]. Take care that if you die fighting [[Essyllt]] you cannot re-enter from the Death Altar. You will be stopped by the game informing you that your items are being held by an allied elf. To traverse from the elven village, head north to the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]]. Pass through the well, and make your way to the bottom level. You can reach the bottom level by either failing a bridge jump or reaching the 'Descend Cave' location south on the perimeter.\n\nYou will reach the dwarven camp. Speak with [[Baxtorian]] (middle), then [[Elena]] (east). She will give you seven [[Explosive potion (Song of the Elves)|explosive potions]] (they're stackable, so you will only need one free inventory space for these). Place them inside the [[hole (Song of the Elves)|holes]] north/outside of the camp's perimeter; then, speak to Baxtorian once again. He will tell you that [[Lord Iorwerth]] wishes to meet with him, and asks that you join him. The meeting will result in [[Arianwyn]] disagreeing with Lord Iorwerth's plan to free [[Seren]] regardless if she becomes evil or not, but choosing to remain with him anyway. The attack will then begin when you select 'I'm ready' option.\n\nDefend the camp for four minutes from several Elf Archers and Warriors, who will also try to destroy the gate defences. Failing will reset the attempt. The elf warriors will infinitely re-spawn. Even while under attack, enemies will not remain aggressive towards you, so you will have to keep attacking different enemies and draw their attention away from the barrier. It doesn't matter if any of them are killed, but the barricade has to hold for <u>four (4) minutes</u> in [[multi-combat]].\n\nSince it isn't needed to actually hit the enemies to change their attention away from the barrier to the player, any weapon will do. Newly spawned enemies always attack the barrier first, so it may be useful to use a low-damage weapon. Fast-hitting weapons also are preferable, for example [[dart]]s, [[throwing knife|knives]] or the [[goblin paint cannon]].\n[[File:Song of the Elves - fighting Essylt.png|thumb|250px|The player battles against Essyllt.]]\nAfter keeping the barrier intact, the elven warriors come storming through the defences anyway and Elena is injured by [[Essyllt]], whom you must kill. Should you die, or leave the battle, you will not have to defend the barrier again.\n\nEssyllt is level 236 and primarily attacks with [[melee]]. He also has two special attacks that he can use at random:\n\n*Essyllt may shove you backwards with his spear, stunning you briefly, and then launch a [[ranged]] attack that can deal significant damage; this can be completely blocked by switching to [[Protect from Missiles]].\n*Essyllt throws a potion at you that drains all your combat stats by 5. This attack cannot be negated with [[protection prayers]], but the stat drain can be offset by drinking a dose of [[Super restore]]. You can also ignore the stat drain if you have high enough combat stats, since the drains don't stack past 5, so your stats will only be drained to max-5.\nNote: After the battle with Essyllt, if your prayer runs out during the following cutscene you will be removed from the cutscene and placed outside of the battle. You can go down the tunnel to the bottom level of the Underground Pass to immediately resume the cutscene.\n\nAfter you defeat him, Lord Iorwerth manages to pass through the crevice into the [[Temple of Light]]; Arianwyn and Baxtorian follow after him. After you check that Elena is alright, you follow as well. Lord Iorwerth will then free the [[Fragment of Seren]], despite Arianwyn's protests. Arianwyn filled with newfound doubt and skepticism shoots Lord Iorwerth wounding him. The Fragment will then drag the player to her realm, believing the player is a servant of Seren sent to dispose of her once and for all.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nSong of the Elves - sealed fragment.png|The elves find the Fragment of Seren, sealed.\nSong of the Elves - Fragment of Seren.png|Lord Iorwerth frees the [[Fragment of Seren]].\nSong of the Elves - freed fragment.png|The Fragment of Seren, enraged.\n</gallery>\n\n==Facing the Dark Lord==\n{{Instance|irs=Rebel Scout|cost=80000}}\n'''Note:''' It may be wise to use your emergency [[teleport]] here and bank before attempting this fight.\n\nThe final part of the quest is to defeat the [[Fragment of Seren]].\n\nShe is weak to [[magic]] attacks. No forms of recoil work. Thralls cannot be summoned.\n\nHer basic attacks are [[ranged]] and [[melee]]. If the player stands next to her, she uses melee, if they stand away from her, she uses ranged. Prayers reduce the damage she causes, but do not fully block it. Players should use [[Protect from Missiles]] and not stand next to her as her melee attacks are much more rapid and can deal loads of damage in very little time compared to ranged.\n\nDuring the encounter she will cycle between multiple special attacks in this order. Each special attack is separated by about 15 seconds (usually enough time for her to do 3 normal attacks). She always announces a special attack by saying some text. Note that there is '''no limit''' to the number of times she can cycle through her special attacks in any given phase.\n[[File:Song of the Elves - fighting Fragment of Seren.png|thumb|250px|A player fights the Fragment of Seren.]] \n#The first special attack teleports the player next to her. This will then be followed by a melee attack, so walk away quickly to avoid damage.\n#The second special attack consists of spawning of multiple copies of her, attacking the correct one (the lighter coloured shadow) will despawn the false ones and cause the Fragment of Seren to reappear.\n#The third special attack consists of multiple beams of red crystals, which will surround the Fragment of Seren and heal her until they are destroyed (4-8 per heal per beam). Any attack will destroy them, so using a fast attack speed weapon such as [[dart]]s or [[toxic blowpipe]] will deal with them quickly, but overall they do not heal much damage so slower weapons will work as well. [[Chinchompas]] are an effective option as the medium-fuse combat style has a 3 tick attack speed, and an attack range of 9 tiles, which prevents the player from accidently running into Seren's melee range when attacking the beams. The beams despawn before the Fragment initiates the final special attack. Using [[Blood spells]] on the beams will heal around 5-6 health per attack, despite them having only 1 health.\n#The final special attack is the most dangerous; she will teleport the player close to her and charge up an unblockable attack that's based on the player's hitpoints, dealing all the way up to the player's '''maximum hitpoints minus 1''', regardless of current hp. After clearing her third special, players should eat up close to their max hp, and then once she teleports the player eat to or above their max hp in order to survive this attack.\n\nAfter the fourth attack, the cycle will continue with the first attack again.\n\nAs the fight progresses the Fragment's special attacks will increase in power. Only the first attack is unaffected by this.\n\n1st phase (between 1,000 and 666 hitpoints)\n*The second special attack creates 1 right and 1 false clone.\n*The third special attack summons 2 healing beams.\n*The final special attack deals '''max hitpoints - 5'''.\n\n2nd phase (between 666 and 333 hitpoints)\n*The second special attack creates 1 right and 2 false clones.\n*The third special attack summons 3 healing beams.\n*The final special attack deals '''max hitpoints - 3'''.\n\n3rd phase (between 333 and 1 hitpoints)\n*The second special attack creates 1 right and 3 false clones.\n*The third special attack summons 4 healing beams.\n*The final special attack deals '''max hitpoints - 1'''.\n\n===Recommended strategy===\n====Equipment====\n*Mage robes (i.e. [[Mystic robes|Mystics]], [[Ahrim the Blighted's equipment|Ahrim's set]], [[ancestral robes]], [[void knight equipment]])\n*[[Trident of the swamp]] (at least 300 charges) or a weapon that can autocast [[Ancient Magicks]] (i.e. [[ancient staff]], [[master wand]] etc.) if using [[blood spells]]. '''Note:''' All damage towards her is capped at 24.\n*Ranged weapon with a quick attack ([[Dart]]s, [[Toxic blowpipe]], or [[Magic shortbow]]) for pillars only. This stops additional healing. Preferably use [[Chinchompa]]s on the [[Chinchompa (weapon)|Medium Fuse]] attack style, as this method will keep you out of the Fragment's melee range while maintaining the same attack speed as darts or throwing knives on accurate/long range.\n*Items with magic bonus (i.e. [[seers ring]], [[occult necklace]], [[imbued god capes]], [[barrows gloves]], [[book of darkness]], [[tome of fire]] etc.)\n*Depending on your levels and strategy, it may be necessary to also incorporate some prayer bonus. Consider bringing e.g. [[amulet of fury]], [[book of darkness]], [[Dagon'hai robes]], [[Elite Void Knight equipment]] or the [[ring of the gods (i)]].\n*If an [[elysian spirit shield]] is accessible, it can reduce the amount of damage you take during the one shot special attack.\n\n====Inventory====\nDepending on strategy, a player may wish to bring a weapon switch (e.g. [[Toxic Blowpipe]]), an emergency teleport, a [[rune pouch]] and/or stacks of [[runes]].\nThe rest of the inventory should be filled with [[Super restore]]s and [[Saradomin brew]]s in a ratio of 1:3.\n\n====Strategy====\n# Drink a dose of [[Saradomin brew]] and [[super restore]] before entering the boss fight.\n# Once in the boss fight, activate [[Protect from Missiles]] and [[Mystic Might]] or [[Augury]] (for extra magic attack). If your prayer bonus and level are high, you may also use [[Rapid Heal]] and perhaps [[Steel Skin|steel skin]] too.\n# Prioritise dealing damage, UNTIL the Fragment summons the pillars. Once you have destroyed all the pillars (or they despawn), immediately drink Saradomin brew until your health is at or above your [[Hitpoints]] level. (If using ranged + blood spells, one good tactic is to sip brew doses inbetween your attacks on the different healers, since a potion does not slow your attacks down, and the decreased stats do not affect your abilities; see 6.).\n# The Fragment of Seren will now launch a projectile at you that deals up to max health minus 1. '''This projectile cannot be avoided.'''\n# Once the damage is dealt, drink Saradomin brews until your health is at a reasonable level, then drink two doses of your super restore potion. This makes sure your [[Magic]] level stays high, so your magic attacks have a higher level of success.\n# If you rely on blood spells remember that drinking [[Saradomin brew]] may disable your ability to cast them and your autocast is cancelled when you attack, which can lead to dangerous situations. It may be a good idea to set the autocast to a lower spell such as [[Blood Rush]] and rely mostly on manual casting, or to ensure that your magic level is sufficiently high before resuming attacks on the Fragment. (Properly drinking three successive brew sips followed by one super restore dose, with auto-retaliate off, will (almost always) keep your high-level spell selected on the autocast menu). (Keep auto-retaliate OFF during the fight if you are using brews. Wandering into melee range when your autocast gets deselected due to brews can result in large melee damage).\n\n'''''Repeat steps 3-5'''; however, be wary you may need to drink Saradomin brew/super restore potion during other phases of the fight.''\n\nAnother good way to beat the Fragment is to use [[Blood spells]] to keep your Hitpoints up. Using this method requires less Saradomin brews, and is easier for people who struggle with the brew/restore ratio. Remember that it may not be necessary to heal to your max Hitpoints ''after'' the unavoidable special attack, as blood spells can heal the remainder.\n\nIf you die during this part, you can pay 80,000 coins to collect your items from the [[rebel scout]] at the southern wall on the upper floor of the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]]. Do not click the crevice and re-enter the Fragment's lair until you have collected all your items from the rebel scout. If you die before collecting your items, '''all your items will be permanently lost.'''\n\nTo '''return''' to the rebel scout and retrieve your items, you can either:\n\n*Teleport using the [[teleport crystal]] to [[Lletya]] and walk back through the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]].\n*Bring a [[crystal trinket]] and use a [[Slayer ring]] teleport to [[dark beast]]s. Enter the [[Temple of Light]]; head up the stairs in front of you, on the next floor climb the Stairs to the south-west. Next, climb down the two sets of stairs to the north. After climbing down and passing through the light door, there should be a [[Blocked Tunnel (Temple of Light)#Open|tunnel]], \"Enter Tunnel\" on the northern wall. This entrance can only be accessed after you've encountered the boss.\n**'''Note:''' If you need to retrieve your things from the [[rebel scout]], you must return to the final room with the altar and crawl through the tunnel. It will then return you to the Underground Pass directly next to the rebel scout.\n*Go through the [[Abyss]] to the [[Death Altar]], exit the altar and go through the tunnel in the same room.\n**'''{{Colour|red|Warning:}}''' ''Highly discouraged, because one death to PK'ers will mean losing all your stored items. Also watch out as your prayer will be drained to 0 upon entering the Abyss.''\n\n====Phoenix necklace strategy====\nEating [[Nightshade|belladonna]] or [[cave nightshade]], drinking a dose of [[Zamorak brew]], or dropping a vial of [[nitroglycerin]] to activate a [[phoenix necklace]] right before the Fragment attacks with her final special attack will nullify all of her damage for a few ticks. To trigger the phoenix necklace you have to use food; while frozen by the Fragment of Seren you can't lower your hp using a [[Rock cake|dwarven rock cake]], or [[Locator orb]] from Dragon Slayer II for example. Blood spells may heal too much for the phoenix necklace to activate. \n\nMore information on this strategy can be found [[Fragment of Seren#Phoenix necklaces|here]].\n\n====Redemption strategy====\nBefore the special attack, make sure your hitpoints are at maximum (or higher) and activate the [[Redemption]] prayer. Drink super restores immediately and re-activate [[Protect from Missiles]] and start casting blood spells. Do not attempt this unless you are confident with the technique of [[Prayer flicking]].\n\n==Prifddinas restored==\nAfter the fight, a short cutscene will be shown where [[Lord Iorwerth]] is horrified with the Fragment's defeat. He states that even though it was angry, hurt and confused, it was also innocent. The wounds Iorwerth sustained prove to be fatal, but he states that he hopes they're happy for what they've done to Seren before dying.\n\nFollowing the defeat of Lord Iorwerth and the Dark Lord, the player is brought to the gates of [[Prifddinas]].\nOutside the newly regrown crystal city, [[Arianwyn]] will meet with the player. The player thanks Arianwyn for stopping Iorwerth, but Arianwyn claims that he had to, and decides to leave the elven lands for good. Ridden with guilt for causing the destruction of [[Lletya]], he decides to travel the world to reflect his own actions, and hopefully redeem himself in the process. He bids farewell to the player as they make their way to the gates, where [[Baxtorian]] welcomes them and [[Elena]] as the first humans to visit the elven city.\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nSong of the Elves - Fragment of Seren defeated.png|The Fragment of Seren, defeated.\nSong of the Elves - Arianwyn leaves.png|Arianwyn, ridden with guilt, leaves.\nSong of the Elves - Prifddinas restored.png|The gates of Prifddinas are opened.\n</gallery>\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Song of the Elves\n|image = [[File:Song of the Elves reward scroll.png|center]]\n|qp = 4\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Agility|40,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Construction|40,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Farming|40,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Herblore|40,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Hunter|40,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Mining|40,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Smithing|40,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Woodcutting|40,000|link=yes}} experience\n*Access to [[Prifddinas]]\n**Ability to fight [[Zalcano]]\n**Access to [[The Gauntlet]]\n**Access to [[Trahaearn Mine]]\n**Access to [[Iorwerth Dungeon]]\n**Ability to change [[respawn]] point to [[Prifddinas]]\n**Ability to move [[Player-owned house]] to [[Prifddinas]]\n**Ability to teleport to [[Prifddinas]] with a [[teleport crystal]]\n**Access to a new [[spirit tree]] destination in [[Prifddinas]]\n**Ability to make [[divine potion]]s\n**Ability to make [[crystal equipment|crystal tools, armour and weaponry]]\nUnlocks:\n* [[Arianwyn]] (as ''Elven Traitor'') and [[Essyllt]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Unlock details\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Music track\n|-\n|[[Stand Up and Be Counted]]\n|Unlocked during the battle of West Ardougne\n|[[File:Stand Up and Be Counted.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Song of the Elves (music track)|Song of the Elves]]\n|Unlocked in the warped Grand Library\n|[[File:Song of the Elves.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[The Fires of Lletya]]\n|Unlocked during the Iorwerth attack on Lletya\n|[[File:The Fires of Lletya.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[No Pasaran]]\n|Unlocked during the defence of the dwarven camp in the Underground Pass\n|[[File:No Pasaran.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[The Fragment]]\n|Unlocked during the fight with the [[Fragment of Seren]]\n|[[File:The Fragment.ogg]]\n|}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 30 November 2022\n|update = The Garden of Death & More\n|poll = Future Quests & Combat Achievement Rewards\n|change = The following skill experience rewards have increased:\n*[[Agility]] from 20,000 to 40,000.\n*[[Construction]] from 20,000 to 40,000.\n*[[Farming]] from 20,000 to 40,000.\n*[[Herblore]] from 20,000 to 40,000.\n*[[Hunter]] from 20,000 to 40,000.\n*[[Mining]] from 20,000 to 40,000.\n*[[Smithing]] from 20,000 to 40,000.\n*[[Woodcutting]] from 20,000 to 40,000.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Song of the Elves login screen.png|thumb|300px|The log in screen upon the release of the quest.]]\n[[File:Song of the Elves Promotional Artwork.jpg|thumb|300px|A piece of official artwork of the quest, showing the player in the Grand Library.]]\n*Song of the Elves is the first quest released in ''Old School'' to complete a quest line from the original game. The quest itself derives a number of elements from its equivalent ''RuneScape'' questline, primarily {{RSL|Plague's End}}, though there are some notable differences in the story:\n**Arianwyn never betrays the player; instead, he stays loyal to the rebel elves and helps defeat the Dark Lord. He is also revealed to be the current Lord Cadarn, giving his name a more proper meaning.\n**The Dark Lord is the result of Seren using {{RSL|Haluned|one of her avatars}} as a vessel for the part of herself obsessed with death. She banished it before shattering herself in order to protect her elves from being corrupted by it.\n**Seren made the elves aware of The Dark Lord's existence, rather than it being forbidden knowledge Lord Iorwerth discovers in the Grand Library.\n**Lord Iorwerth is killed by the Dark Lord.\n**The West Ardougne Revolution and the overthrowing of King Lathas is much different. Instead of the whole city going on fire, it is only a single attack on the Mourner HQ. The group the player works with is different, consisting of Elena, Ted and Martha Rehnison, Jethick, Nurse Sarah, Carla, and Koftik. In addition, you do not fight the Knights of Ardougne nor [[Hero]]es; rather, they join you against the overthrowing of the King, while the Paladins and Warrior Women fight against you. In the end, you fight Sir Hugo, who guards the King.\n**You were given the choice to either send King Lathas in exile or execute him (though in the case of the former he is killed by the Dark Lord anyway).\n**Essyllt could be spared during the attack on Mourner HQ, potentially making him the third known Iorwerth survivor, along with Morvran and Iesten. He is also cowardly, begging for mercy upon being defeated, a stark contrast to his ''Old School'' variant who is more aggressive. The player also has significantly more interactions with him in ''RuneScape''.\n**Lletya's location is not revealed, sparing it from an attack by the Iorwerth elves.\n**Another quest in ''RuneScape'', {{RSL|Within the Light}}, came chronologically in between Mourning's End Part II and Plague's End, and is omitted completely from ''Old School RuneScape''. In addition, Baxtorian's involvement in Song of the Elves is derived from the sequel to Plague's End, {{RSL|The Light Within}} (he is completely absent from Plague's End).\n[[File:Seal of the Forgotten.png|thumb|170px|The Seal of the Forgotten, representing the Cywir Clan.]]\n*The Seal of the Forgotten is dedicated to the former 9th [[Elven Clan]], the {{RSL|Cywir}}, who chose to remain on the Elven homeworld of Tarddiad.\n**The symbol used for the Cywir Clan is erroneous as the Cywir Clan has no confirmed colour or symbol. The symbol used is derived from an item called {{RSL|Seal of the Cywir}}, which is named because they are dropped by the Seren faction general and clan leader of the Cywir Clan, {{RSL|Helwyr}}. The other factions led by other generals have the exact same symbol, which is a motif taken from the {{RSL|Heart of Gielinor}}, albeit in different colours corresponding to their respective faction. Purple for [[Zaros]], red for [[Zamorak]], green for [[Sliske]] and the cyan colour representing [[Seren]] rather than the Cywir Clan itself.\n*When you speak to Alrena with silk and purple dye already in your inventory, she comments about how lucky it is that the player already has the necessary items.\n*When the player speaks with the Knight of Ardougne, they remark on how they are constantly attacked and pickpocketed, the latter referring to how players use them for [[Thieving]] training.\n*If the player attempts to tax the Bank of Ardougne by talking to any banker, they reply that in return the player would have to be taxed for their bank usage as well. The player immediately rejects this idea and responds with \"On second thought... forget I said anything.\" The same joke is made when attempting to collect taxes from bankers on behalf of [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]] during [[The Fremennik Isles]].\n*If the player has an Elf Slayer task, none of the enemies that you need to kill for this quest count towards it.\n*When you speak to [[Elena]] about growing the elder cadantine, she asks you to fetch a cadantine seed and a seed dibber while she prepares the patch in the meantime. If you already have these items in your inventory and state you already have them, she replies with \"Well it also happens that I've actually already prepared the patch\". Which could be a joke to players reading ahead on a guide to know which items they'd have to bring.\n*Upon examining one of the dead elves, the text will read \"At least they didn't take an arrow to the knee.\", which is a reference to a quote from the game {{wp|The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim}}.\n*Dialogue with [[Lord Iorwerth]] throughout the quest makes reference to the {{wp|List of Star Wars films|Star Wars films}}, most notably {{wp|Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones}}, with Lord Iorwerth quoting Sith lords. Examples include \"they may still be of use to us,\" (which Darth Vader says in A New Hope), and \"brave of you [to come here Arianwyn], but foolish,\" (which Count Dooku says to both Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu in Attack of the Clones). Responses by characters also match dialogue from the Star Wars prequel, such as when Islwyn says they won't barter, and when Iorwerth tells Arianwyn that he once thought as he did.\n*A week before the release of the quest, it was added to the [[Quest List]] interface with the text in grey ({{colour|#9f9f9f|Song of the Elves}}). When the quest was clicked on, the usual interface opened but with the description:\n{{Cquote2|{{colour|#000080|COMING SOON to}} {{colour|#800000|Old School RuneScape}}{{colour|#000080|...}}\n\n{{colour|#000080|I can start this quest}} {{colour|#800000|after the next update}} {{colour|#000080|by talking to}} {{colour|#800000|Edmond}} {{colour|#000080|at his home, north of the}} {{colour|#800000|Flying Horse Inn}} {{colour|#000080|in}} {{colour|#800000|East Ardougne}}{{colour|#000080|.}}}}\n*If you talk to Elena before the attack on the Underground Pass, she will tell the player not to die and will say they care for each other.\n*The track that plays during the attack on the Underground Pass is called \"[[No Pasaran]],\" Spanish for \"They will not pass,\" a saying used by the Republican faction of the Spanish Civil War in their fight against the Nationalists, which in subsequent years became a common {{wp|They shall not pass|slogan of anti-fascist resistance}}.\n*When setting fire to the grain above Ardougne, your character says \"You set fire to the grain\", likely a reference to the Adele song stating \"I set fire to the rain\".\n*The player is asked their name multiple times during the quest, to which their response depends on the player's selected [[pronouns]], with \"Tim?\" if he/him, \"Sue?\" if she/her, or \"Sam?\" if they/them. This is a possible reference to Tim the Enchanter from ''{{wp|Monty Python and the Holy Grail}}'', who answers King Arthur in a similar manner.\n\n{{Song of the Elves}}"

On [[death]], all unprotected items will be moved to a [[grave]] outside the rift, and any items left on the ground will be lost. Do not drop anything you'll need later on.\n\nAdditionally, during the quest, be careful not to click during any of the [[cutscene]]s, or else you'll be teleported out and forced to go through the cutscene again.\n\nPlayers may leave the rift to get food or supplies at any time during the quest, but will have to re-start any incomplete rooms. Progress for fully completed rooms, however, will be saved. The same principle applies for logging out; if you log out, you lose your progress on uncompleted rooms, and will appear above the rift next time you log in.\n\nFinally, pures should be aware that completing the '''rage''' section awards 40 [[Attack]] experience.\n\n==Walkthrough==\n[[File:A Soul's Bane - Launa at the rift.png|thumb|300x300px|Launa at the rift.]]\n[[File:Launa chathead.png|left|frameless|140x140px]]\nHead east of [[Varrock]], through the gate by the [[Earth Altar]], and speak to [[Launa]].

Alternatively, take a [[glider]] to [[Digsite]].\n\nLauna explains that she is looking for her son, Tolna, as well as husband, who both went down into the rift to find him. Offer to help her find them, then use a [[rope]] on the [[Rift (Tolna's rift)|rift]] and climb down.\n\nThe quest has four \"rooms\" which you will need to get through to complete the quest, as well as a final boss room at the end. Each room will have multiple enemies, which must be killed to progress to the next one.\n\n===Rage===\n{{Cquote2|''\"<big>Why should I, Tolna, be trapped in such a wretched place?

When entering this room, players will see a [[weapon rack (Tolna's rift)|weapon rack]], which contains four types of weapons. Each of the weapons only work on a specific monster, and will deal normal damage multiplied by 10 when correctly chosen.[[File:A Soul's Bane - maximum outrage.gif|thumb|500x500px|The player, outraged, kills all the remaining monsters.]]To defeat the monster, unwield your weapon and shield, and select one of the weapons from the rack and wield it.

Each creature killed will fill the \"rage level\" bar at the top of the screen. After several kills of the player's choice of angry creatures, the bar will reach maximum and the player will yell, spin, and kill all remaining monsters in the room.\n\nA cutscene will then play, in which Tolna leaves his mother for a more lucrative life. Players can then exit out of the rage room near the east end of the cave, and proceed to the next room.\n\n===Fear===\n{{Cquote2|''\"<big>It's so quiet and dark.

There will be a small \"jumpscare\" when you search the hole, where a reaper's face will appear.\n\nYou will need to kill five reapers, at which point your character will state that they are no longer afraid, and you may proceed to the next room. Note that you '''cannot''' search the same hole over and over again. You will need to move around the room looking into each hole in sequence and starting over once they have all been looked-into. Depending on your luck, it will take approximately 4 or 5 trips around the room to complete all five kills.\n[[File:A Soul's Bane - dark holes.png|thumb|300x300px|You must look into the dark holes.

The illusions will disappear after you hit eight zeroes on them; players can simply keep attacking the beasts until they disappear, or disengage by running to the opposite corner and then attacking another beast.\n\nOnce you kill the real confusion, one of the confusing doors will vanish, and the rest of the beasts will respawn. Repeat the previous process four more times, until only one door remains, at which point a cutscene will trigger.\n\n[[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] is best for this step, as the beasts attack from a distance. When using [[melee]], they have a chance to inflict [[poison]], which can be negated by attacking with a long-distance weapon. [[Throwing knife|Throwing knives]] or other fast weapons are helpful for speedy kills on the illusions.\n\nIllusions will chase you after attacking, and will keep you from attacking any of the other monsters while you are still in combat.\n\nYou will see a cutscene after the last kill.

The three heads are very easy to beat with [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]], although be warned that if using range without an [[Ava's device|accumulator]], player will not be able to retrieve their arrows.\n\nAfter killing each head, Tolna will become human again.

Use [[Telekinetic Grab]] to steal the [[ancestral key]] from the enclosed area.\n\n===The Waterfall===\n{{Needed|[[Robe of elidinis]], [[rope]], [[ancestral key]], '''melee weapons in each of the 3 attack styles,''' [[bow]] '''and''' [[arrows]]''',''' [[pickaxe]]''',''' [[ballad]].|recommended=[[Armour]] and some [[food]].}}\n[[File:Water Ravine Dungeon entrance.png|thumb|The waterfall.]]\n{{Map|3371,3132|r=4|mtype=square|align=right|width=220|height=220|caption=The location of the waterfall on the map.}}\nThe next location is the waterfall at the source of the [[River Elid]], on the east bank. To get there, either:\n\n*Leave Nardah and walk north-west until you come to the banks of the River Elid, and then follow them to the north until you come to a waterfall at the source of the river. On the way, you'll pass respawn points for a [[bronze pickaxe]], a [[shortbow]], and some [[bronze arrows]]. Take these if you don't already have them in your inventory.\n*You will also pass by a [[Desert Phoenix]]; pluck a [[Phoenix feather]] for use in [[The Golem]] and for a medium task in the [[Desert Diary]].\n*Alternatively, return to [[Shantay Pass]] (via [[magic carpet]]s or [[amulet of glory]]/[[ring of dueling]] teleport to [[Al Kharid]]) and retrieve a bow and some arrows from the bank if you don't have in your inventory. You also will pass an arrow spawn on your way through the desert. Once back in the desert, head south-east to a bridge and cross the River Elid—then, follow the river north to the [[Water Ravine Dungeon|dungeon]] entrance.\n*Alternatively, you can use a [[necklace of passage]] to teleport to Eagle's Eyrie and run south-west for a short while.\n\nWhen you reach the dungeon entrance, use your [[rope]] on the root above the waterfall to enter.\n\nWhile wearing the Robes of Elidinis top and bottom, open the door with the ancestral key in your inventory. If you are not wearing the robes, or do not have the ballad, your character will ask what they could possibly have forgotten.\n\n===The Golems===\nOnce you're inside, ignore the door to the north; head east a short ways to where you'll see three doors. Upon attempting to open each door, you'll be attacked by one of three coloured level-75 golems, which can only be defeated by one type of attack style ([[Crush]]/[[Slash]]/[[Stab]]). A [[Spear]] or [[Hasta]] can use all of these attack styles in one slot, and a pickaxe (if decent material) can use Stab / Crush. It is also possible to fight the black golem (Crush) unarmed, but this is only recommended if your stats are high (70+) due to its high [[Defence]] level. After defeating them, the door they protected will open. Enter the room and solve the puzzle to clear the water channel:\n\nIf you attempt to open the door before the golem has finished its death animation, another golem will spawn.\n[[File:Spirits of the Elid - Clearing the Channel.png|thumb|Clearing the channel using range.]]\n\n*The [[black golem]] protecting the '''north-east room''' is vulnerable to '''crushing attacks'''. Once inside, you'll see a [[target]] on the other side of the water channel. Equip your bow and arrow and shoot it. Once you've hit it, the channel will be cleared. If you don't do damage and the water doesn't start flowing, you didn't clear it.\n*The [[grey golem]] protecting the '''east room''' is vulnerable to '''slashing attacks'''. Once it's dead, clear the water channel with your pickaxe.\n*The [[white golem]] in the '''south room''' is vulnerable to '''stabbing attacks'''. Kill it, then clear the water channel behind the door with [[Thieving]].\n\nAfter you clear all three channels, go north through the remaining door, walk around the lake, and talk to the spirits, [[Nirrie]], [[Tirrie]] and [[Hallak]]. They'll tell you to recover the sacred [[Statuette (Spirit of the Elid)|Statue of Elidinis]] and return it to the shrine in Nardah to break the curse.\n\n===The Crevice===\n{{Needed|[[knife]], [[light source]], [[rope]].}}\n\nGo to Nardah and talk to the mayor again. He will tell you that they threw the statue down a [[Crevice (Spirits of the Elid)|crevice]] west of town. While you're here, take the mayor's [[Shoes (Spirits of the Elid)|shoes]] from beside the door and use your [[knife]] on them to remove their [[sole]]s. (The mayor won't let you if you're too close to him.)\n{{Map|3374,2905|r=6|mtype=square|align=right|width=220|height=220|caption=The crevice, west of Nardah.}}\nGo west from the general store in Nardah until you come to the crevice and use a rope on it. You need a [[light source]], or else you'll be eaten alive by tiny bugs. Talk to the [[Genie (Spirits of the Elid)|genie]] (the evil brother of the [[Genie|random event]]). He will tell you to get the mayor's sole in exchange for the statue. Give the soles to him to get the statue back.\n\nFinally, take the statue to the shrine back in town (the building you stole the key in) and place it on the statuette plinth.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n:'''Note:''' After completing the quest, pray-at the [[Elidinis Statuette]] to complete a [[medium Desert Diary]] task. At least one Prayer point must be restored, praying at it with full Prayer will not complete the task.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Spirits of the Elid|image=[[File:Spirits of the Elid reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=2|rewards=*{{SCP|Prayer|8,000}} [[Prayer]] experience\n*{{SCP|Thieving|1,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{SCP|Magic|1,000}} [[Magic]] experience\n*Access to [[Nardah]]'s fountain for water and the [[Elidinis Statuette|shrine]]: Praying at the statuette will fill [[Hitpoints]], temporarily boost it, cure poison and venom, restore [[prayer points]], [[run energy]], and [[special attack energy]].\n*[[Robe of elidinis]]}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Spirits of the Elid is required for the following:\n*[[Medium Desert Diary]] - Visit the Genie.\n*[[Medium Desert Diary]] - Pray at the Statuette.\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Awusah the Mayor]] will tell the player that the priest of [[Saradomin]] was convinced that by praying, he could become impervious to arrows. If the player has at least 40 Prayer, the player may respond that it is easy and they can do it as well, referring to the [[Protect from Missiles]] prayer.\n*If the player tries to take the lamp from the table in the genie's underground chamber, the genie will stop the player saying \"Hey get your hands off my house.\"\n*If the player tries to take the genie's lamp using the Telekinetic Grab spell, the genie will shout at the player \"Hey no casting spells on my house!\"\n*Examining the Genie prompts the text \"Phenomenal cosmic powers, itty-bitty living space\". This is a reference to a line from Disney's animated film ''Aladdin''.\n*The snakes in the first part of the crevice may be a reference to the snakes in the cave that Indiana Jones and Marion are thrown in the movie, ''Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.''\n\n{{Spirits of the Elid}}"

Although you enter the area early on in the quest, during the quest you are in an instance which is a copy of the area.

A [[Teleportation|teleport]] to [[Draynor Village]] or nearby.}}\n\nThe easiest way to reach the [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony]] is to teleport using the [[Piscatoris teleport]] scroll. It can also be reached by boat, from the river west of the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]]. To use the boat, you must either pay [[Kathy Corkat]] 50 [[coins]], or charm her while wearing the [[Ring of Charos]]. After you have started the quest, you will not need to pay her again. You can also use the [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|AKQ}}, and run north-east to the Colony.\n\nOnce you reach the Colony, walk a short distance north-east, and speak to [[Herman Caranos]]. When you agree to help him, the quest will start. He will ask you to find the [[Wise Old Man]] of [[Draynor Village]] and secure his services. Agree to this, and travel to Draynor Village.\n\n<gallery>\nSwan Song flashback (1).png|Killing an [[Ogre shaman]]\nSwan Song flashback (2).png|Killing the [[Drunken Dwarf]]\nSwan Song flashback (3).png|Subduing [[The Shaikahan]]\nSwan Song flashback (4).png|Fighting the [[Kalphite Queen]]\nSwan Song flashback (5).png|Fighting [[Dad]]\n</gallery>\n\n===The Wise Old Man===\n{{Needed|10 [[lava rune]]s, 10 [[mist rune]]s, and 5 [[blood rune]]s.}}\n\nTalk to the [[Wise Old Man]]. After some conversation, he will tell you that he requires 10 [[lava rune]]s, 10 [[mist rune]]s and 5 [[blood rune]]s before he will help you. Give him these [[runes]], and return to the [[Fishing Colony]].\n\n===Battle at the Colony===\n{{Needed|[[Combat equipment]] to fight 8 level 79 [[Sea troll]]s with no [[Ranged]]/[[Magic]] [[safespot]]s.|recommended=A [[Teleportation|teleport]] to [[Yanille]], 5 [[iron bar]]s, [[logs]], a hammer and a [[tinderbox]]. Fishing level boosting item if you're below 62.}}\n\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Sea troll fight.png|thumb|The player and the Wise Old Man confront several sea trolls.]]\nTravel back to the [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony]]. The [[Wise Old Man]] will be waiting in place of [[Herman Caranos]]. Talk to him to enter the main Colony grounds, where you will be attacked by eight (8) level 79 [[Sea troll]]s. The Wise Old Man will help you by casting [[Saradomin Strike]] on the trolls (he hits super high, sometimes over 40); however, after 10 casts, he runs out of runes and resorts to throwing stones at the trolls, with a maximum hit of 2. Note that you can \"use\" blood, air, and fire runes on The Wise Old Man during the fight to give him more runes. However, he will only take one rune each time you use them on him, making this not recommended as the trolls will continue to attack you. The trolls only attack with melee so using Protect from Melee will prevent you from taking any damage.\n\nOnce you have killed the trolls, enter the gates of the Colony. The Wise Old Man will tell you to find Herman Caranos, after which he will disappear. Herman is in the building at the eastern end of the Colony.\n\n:'''Tip''': Pick up the bones that the trolls drop as you'll need 7 of them later in the quest.\n:'''Optional:''' You can search Herman's desk for a [[Herman's book|book]], which tells you about the Wise Old Man's past. If you have a house with a bookcase in it, this book will become available after the quest.\n\nWhen you talk to Herman, the Wise Old Man will reappear. You will then be told to do some odd jobs around the colony.\n\n===Repairing the Colony===\nThe following two tasks can be done in any order:\n#Talk with [[Arnold Lydspor]], and refill the [[Fishing Colony]]'s food stocks.\n#Talk with [[Franklin Caranos]], and repair the Colony's walls.\n\n====Arnold Lydspor====\n[[File:Fishing for fresh monkfish.png|thumb|A player is attacked by a sea troll while attempting to fish.]]\n[[Arnold Lydspor]] can be located in the [[bank]] to the west of [[Herman Caranos]], at the bank sign on the [[minimap]].\n:'''Note:''' Arnold's bank and [[Arnold's Eclectic Supplies.|general store]] cannot be accessed until the quest is complete.\n\nHe will tell you that the [[Fishing Colony]] has no food and that he needs five cooked [[fresh monkfish]]. He will give you a [[small fishing net]] with which to catch fresh monkfish. The [[fishing spot (Swan Song)|fishing spot]] for them is located to the north-west. If you are using a boost to exactly level 62, bring at least eight doses because [[Sea troll|trolls]] will spawn each time you try to fish, which will take up time and your level may drop. Catch a few extra as you may burn the fish.\n\nWhile fishing, you will be attacked by three Sea Trolls whose levels get progressively higher - levels 65, 87 and 101. You must kill these in order to continue fishing. When you have caught the fresh monkfish, you can cook it on a [[range]] to the south. When you have five cooked fresh monkfish, take them to Arnold. If you burn some, you can give him the cooked ones and go back to fish for more.  Despite being quest items, once cooked the left-click of fresh monkfish is \"eat\", and they will heal 1hp if eaten.\n\n====Franklin Caranos====\n[[Franklin Caranos]] is near the entrance gate of the [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony|Colony]]. He will ask you to make five [[iron sheet]]s to repair the west walls. He will give you a [[tinderbox]] to heat the metal press. If you have the [[iron bar]]s and [[logs]], you can skip the following steps:\n[[File:Fixing colony wall.png|thumb|A player fixing the colony walls.]]\nPick up a [[pickaxe]] and an [[axe]] from the pile east of Franklin. Exit the Colony via the gate, and head back underneath the hole. To the south, you should find several rocks; mine enough [[iron ore]]s to make five iron bars (you will be able to smith them with the usual 50% success rate at the Colony), and cut down a [[dead tree]] for some logs. Return to the Colony and smith your ores into bars, returning to the rocks and mining more ores if required, until you have five bars.\n\nGo into the building with the [[small furnace (Piscatoris Fishing Colony)|furnace]], and use your logs on the Firebox east end of the press then use the tinderbox and light them. Then, use your iron bars with the press to make iron sheets. Tell Franklin that you have the sheets, and he will give you a [[hammer]], with which you can repair the walls to the west. Once you have done this, talk to Franklin again.\n\nNote: When you repair the wall, you need to use the Iron Sheets on the broken wall. If you use the hammer on the broken wall, your character will yell and hammer the wall. You'll receive a message that you feel a lot calmer, but it didn't achieve anything, and to use the iron sheets on the wall instead.\n\n'''{{Colour|Red|Important}}:''' Keep the pickaxe since you'll need it to mine [[clay]] in the next part if you didn't bring any.\n\n===Raising an army===\n{{Needed|A [[pickaxe]] (to mine the [[clay]], needed only if you didn't bring any).|recommended=7 [[bones]], a [[pot]] and a [[pot lid]]. (If making a pot lid, bring a pickaxe.)}}\n\nNext, go back to the [[Wise Old Man]] and [[Herman Caranos]], who tell you that they need an army to fight and defeat the [[Sea troll]]s once and for all. The Wise Old Man tells you to visit [[Wizard Frumscone]], in the basement of the [[Wizards' Guild]].\n:'''Note:''' This is where you need to boost your [[Magic]] level if it is lower than 66.\n\nYou may find it advisable to pick up a [[pickaxe]], if you have not done so already, before you leave for [[Yanille]]. You can use any recommended methods as mentioned to travel to Yanille. If you use the minigame teleport to the Nightmare Zone you will need to leave the area through the tunnel first.\n\nAt Yanille, you may get seven normal [[bones]], [[pot]] and [[pot lid]] from the bank if you have them. Head into the Wizards' Guild and go down the ladder. Wizard Frumscone will appear and refuse to help you, but he does tell you of one who may - [[Malignius Mortifer]].\n\n'''{{Colour|Red|Important}}:''' Be sure to bank any [[God Wars Dungeon#God equipment|Saradomin]]-related items prior to talking to Malignius, or he will refuse to help you. As he teleports you to [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony]] when you speak to him, it is not advised to drop any items.\n\nAfter making the [[pottery]], however, you may wear your items.\n{{Map|name=Malignius Mortifer|x=2990|y=3268|r=10|mtype=square|width=250|height=250|align=right|caption=Malignius Mortifer's location.}}\nYou can use your charged [[amulet of glory]] if you have them to teleport to [[Draynor Village]], and head west to find Malignius, who is accompanied by elemental wizards, slightly north-west of the [[Port Sarim]] [[Betty's Magic Emporium|magic shop]].\n\nAlternatively, you can use the southern portal at the top of the Guild to take you to the [[Dark Wizards' Tower]]. The [[dark wizard]]s drop [[bones]], so you can kill seven of them for seven bones if you still need them. Walk south, through the gate, and then south-east from here to find Malignius.\n\nMalignius will tell you that he needs seven normal bones. You can kill [[Highwayman|highwaymen]] or the [[chicken]]s in the farm nearby for these. (You cannot kill the surrounding wizards, as they drop [[ashes]].) When you give them to him, he will tell you that you also need some way of storing the seeds he will give you, and that you should ask in the [[Crafting Guild]] to the west. He will give you a [[brown apron]], which will allow you access.\n\nAsk the [[Master Crafter|master craftsmen]] (the one with no skillcape) about how to store the seeds until you find the one that will tell you; you will need simply a pot with a pot lid. ''You may skip the rest of this paragraph if you have both items''. Mine two pieces of [[clay]] in the [[Crafting Guild mining site|Guild mine]]; use the [[jug]] in the northern end of the Guild filled with water from the sink to the south to soften the clay, and then shape them on the [[potter's wheel]]. Fire them in the [[pottery oven]].\n:'''Warning:''' Now, you may wish to restock your combat supplies for the upcoming fight at a bank as Malignius will, without any warning, teleport you to the [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony]] after you have finished talking with him.\n\nNow, return to Malignius with your pot and pot lid, and he will teleport you to the Fishing Colony.\n\n===The final battle===\n{{Needed|Bone seeds, [[Combat equipment]] to defeat a level 170 [[Sea Troll Queen]], which is able to use [[Magic]], [[Melee]] and can drain [[Prayer]]. [[Ranged]]/Magic [[safespot]]s are available but not advisable.}}\n{{Instance}}\n\nAfter entering the [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony|Colony]] and talking to [[Herman Caranos]], you will be shown a cutscene of your army of [[Skeleton Mage]]s defeating the [[Sea troll]]s and then the [[Wise Old Man]] killing the levelless [[Sea Troll General]]. However, while he is celebrating, he gets hit for 254 damage (which doesn't make the slightest dent on his health bar). He will be disabled for the rest of the fight, so you must take on the [[Sea Troll Queen]] yourself.\n\n<gallery>\nRise from the Sea.png|The Sea Trolls rise from the ocean depths.\nSwan Song army.png|This means war!\nSea Troll General dies.png|The Wise Old Man kills the [[Sea Troll General]]\nWise Old Man weakened.png|The Wise Old Man is badly hurt by a powerful water spell.\nThe Sea Troll Queen.png|You must fight the Sea Troll Queen!\n</gallery>\n\nThe Queen cannot move from her location, so anywhere not directly next to her is suitable for long-ranged attacks. The Queen uses the [[Magic]] attack [[Water Wave]] and a basic [[Melee]] attack where possible. If you are using overhead [[protection prayers]] and are not within melee range, the queen will use a [[Prayer]]-draining attack. This means that ''long-ranged attacks are inadvisable'' unless you are confident in your [[armour]] to protect you from powerful magical spells (e.g. [[Armadyl armour]]). Meleeing the queen means she will not use her prayer draining attack; however, she uses both Melee and Magic attacks. She is much more damaging with magical attacks, so it is '''best to use [[Protect from Magic]] and wear [[Armour/Melee armour|melee armour]]'''. She is not too hard for a skilled fighter, though she should not be taken for a pushover either.\n\nIt is possible to wear full [[Mystic robes]] and use the Mystic Might Prayer. This way the queen splashes more often. Be careful though, she can still hit 25 consistently. Use the best [[Wave spell]] you can.\n\nAfter defeating the queen, talk to [[Herman]] to finish the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Swan Song\n|image = [[File:Swan Song reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Magic|15,000}} [[Magic]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Prayer|10,000}} [[Prayer]] experience\n*{{SCP|Fishing|50,000}} [[Fishing]] experience\n*25,000 [[coins]]\n*Access to the [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony]]\n**The ability to fish [[monkfish]]\n**The ability to use [[Skeleton Mage]]s for training\n**Use [[Kathy Corkat]]'s boat for free\n*Access to the following items from [[Malignius Mortifer]] upon request:\n**A [[brown apron]]\n**[[Bone seeds]] (requires an [[airtight pot]])\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Swan Song is required for the following:\n*[[Making Friends with My Arm]]\n*[[Western Provinces Hard Diary]]\n*[[Secrets of the North]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 30 November 2022\n|update = The Garden of Death & More\n|poll = Future Quests & Combat Achievement Rewards\n|change = The xp rewarded to the [[Fishing]] skill was increased from 10,000 to 50,000.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 17 January 2019\n|update = Kebos Graphical Changes and Other Fixes\n|type = mobile\n|change = The chatbox interface no longer obstructs cutscenes on mobile.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*{{Wp|Swan song}} is an idiom referring to a final theatrical or dramatic appearance, or any final work or accomplishment.\n*At the start of the quest when Herman Caranos explains that he needs an expert adventurer, players who have finished [[Legends' Quest]] will remark \"''Expert adventurer?

The species of monkfish found in Piscatoris Fishing Colony, which will be available for players to fish after this quest, receives its image from a deep sea monkfish known as {{Wp|Lophius piscatorius|anglerfish}}, whose Latin name is ''Lophius piscatorius''.\n*The [[Sea Troll Queen]] looks nothing like a [[Sea troll]] at all, but more like a giant squid or octopus.\n*During the final cutscene of the quest, the player's character begs the Wise Old Man for his [[blue partyhat]] as a reward, only to be completely ignored. This is a reference to the insane value of partyhats in ''[[RuneScape 2]]'', the blue partyhat frequently being one of the most expensive to buy. Even the least expensive partyhats often went for millions to tens of millions of coins each at the time of this quest's release.\n*Release of this quest introduced a bug that would randomly hit high numbers and cause an unsafe death for players standing in specific locations on the same world as somebody who is doing the quest fights with the Wise Old Man. This bug was confirmed and fixed on May 16th, 2006 with no roll back.\n*If the player talks to the Wise Old Man with the necessary runes already in their inventory, the Wise Old Man will remark how efficient the player is, and the player will respond \"''Sometime I amaze even myself.''\" a reference to {{WP|Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: A New Hope}}.\n\n{{Swan Song}}"

Then, go south to the [[Karamja Wines, Spirits, and Beers|Karamja Spirits Bar]] and purchase [[Karamjan rum|Karamja Rum]]. Slice the [[banana]] using your knife and add the [[sliced banana]] to your rum, making sure not to accidentally eat the sliced banana. Make sure you combine the sliced banana with the rum '''before''' you leave the island, or the rum will break. The rum combined with sliced banana will be necessary in a later part of the quest.\n\nAfter obtaining the Karamjan rum, travel south to [[Tai Bwo Wannai]] (fairy ring {{Fairycode|CKR}}) and talk with [[Timfraku]] upstairs in the north-west house with a quest [[icon]] above it. Talk with him, and say that [[Trufitus]] sent you. Talk to him again, and when he thanks you for what you have done so far, pick the option \"So far??\" and he will ask you to gather his sons, [[Tamayu]], [[Tiadeche]], and [[Tinsay]], in the village. {{Colour|Red|Warning}}: The [[Tribesmen]] in and around Tai Bwo Wannai are aggressive to players level 64 and under and deal very high poison damage, easily killing unprepared low-level players. The general store north of Tai Bwo Wannai sells [[antipoison]]s if you forgot to bring some.\n\n:'''''Optional:''''' To avoid accidentally banking/losing the [[Karamjan rum (sliced banana)]], you can visit Tinsay at [[Cairn Isle]] (near fairy ring {{Fairycode|CKR}}) and give it to him. This will fulfil the first of three requests he makes later on.\n{{clear|right}}\n===Tamayu===\n'''''Items required:''' An [[iron spear]] or better ([[Black spear]], [[Bone spear]], and [[Leaf-bladed spear]] do '''not''' work), a [[small fishing net]], a [[pestle and mortar]] or 6 gold, and an [[Agility potion|Agility potion(4)]].''\n\n'''''Optional:''' [[Logs]] (or an axe to chop them), a [[tinderbox]], and a [[raw karambwan]] (one is obtainable later in the quest), [[Brimhaven teleport|Brimhaven Teleport]].''\n\n[[File:Meeting Tamayu.png|thumb|Tamayu must slay the Shaikahan before he returns to the village.]]\nYou can find [[Tamayu]] south-east of Tai Bwo Wannai Village at the mine. He will return to Tai Bwo Wannai only once he has killed [[The Shaikahan]]. Talk to him twice; ask him when he will succeed and offer to join him on his next hunt. During a [[cutscene]] Tamayu will fail to defeat The Shaikahan. He will claim that he is overpowered by its strength, regenerating health, and agility.\n\n'''Do not give your [[spear]] or [[Agility potion]] to Tamayu yet. You must poison the spear with karambwan paste, obtained later in the quest, before giving it to Tamayu.''' Go to the [[Holy Lake]] south-west of Tamayu and net-fish for at least 22 [[raw karambwanji]]. (It's recommended to have a few spares or keep the net for later if your [[Cooking]] level is low.) (They are different from [[Karambwan]] and stack like other forms of bait.) If you still need logs, there are some trees that can be cut to the south-west of this pond near the Hunter icon on the minimap.\n\nNow travel north. If you don't have a [[Pestle and mortar]], you can buy one at [[Jiminua's Jungle Store]] (general store icon) north-west of the village. Then continue and talk to [[Lubufu]] (near the POH portal, [[Brimhaven teleport|Brimhaven Teleport]] is useful here) by the fishing [[icon]] on the south-eastern shore of [[Brimhaven]].\n\n[[File:Tai Bwo Wannai Trio Lubufu.png|thumb|Lubufu teaching you the secrets to catching karambwan.]]\nSelect to \"Talk about him...\" and ask him how old he is. Then offer to help him collect bait, and then say that he sounds like he could do with the help. He will then tell you to catch 20 karambwanji. Give him the karambwanji and ask him what he uses to catch karambwan, followed by what he does with them, and he will ask you if you want to become his apprentice. He will then give you a [[karambwan vessel]] and the information that it must be filled with karambwanji as bait. '''You can now catch [[raw karambwan]] with 65 fishing, you will also receive 1500 [[Fishing]] experience'''. If your character goes idle after a couple seconds of fishing, you need to fish at the fishing spots next to Tiadecehe in the north east of Karamja. It is recommended you collect more vessels at this stage, one for [[Tiadeche]], one for [[Tinsay]] and one for yourself. You can obtain more by dropping the one in your inventory and then asking [[Lubufu]] for another.\n\nOnce you have obtained as many as you wish use a [[raw karambwanji]] on one of these vessels.\n\nSee below on how to complete the Tamayu part of this quest.\n[[File:Tai Bwo Wannai Trio - Tiadeche catches a karambwan.png|thumb|Tiadeche catches a karambwan.]]\n\n===Tiadeche===\n{{Needed|A [[Karambwan vessel]], and a [[Raw karambwanji]]. Logs and Tinderbox, and a [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] method to kill a [[Monkey]] if you want to save time.}}\n\nNext, go to the north-east corner of the Karamja jungle (fairy ring {{Fairycode|DKP}}) to seek out [[Tiadeche]]. Once found, talk to him. He says he will go back to Tai Bwo Wannai after you teach him how to catch [[Karambwan]]. Give him your '''full''' [[Karambwan vessel]] '''(use your karambwanji on the vessel first, then use the full vessel on Tiadeche)''' and he will subsequently give you a [[Raw karambwan]]. He will also ask you to visit his brother [[Tinsay]] for another matter.\n\nWhile you are here you can grab the nearby [[Seaweed]] that spawns on the beach as you will need it later on.\n\nOnce you have the raw karambwan, cook it to obtain a [[poison karambwan]]. If you are an Ironman and burn the [[Karambwan]] you will need 65 [[Fishing]] in order to catch another. Consider using the [[Hosidius Kitchen]] or some other [[Cooking#Temporary boosts|Cooking boosts]] to minimise the risk of burning it. Worth noting, catching a [[raw karambwan]] is a Karamja medium diary achievement.\n\nUse the [[pestle and mortar]] on the [[Poison karambwan]] to produce [[Karambwan paste]]. Then, use the paste on the [[spear]] to create a karambwan poisoned spear. If you eat the [[Poison karambwan]] you will become [[poison]]ed and can easily die, so right-click on it and select the \"use\" option, or simply use the pestle and mortar to avoid doing so.\n\nNow, head back to [[Tamayu]] by running south. If you didn't purchase the [[Jogre bones]], kill a [[Jogre]] on the way and pick up the bones. If you don't have a spear, you can continue killing jogres until they drop an [[iron spear]]. Cross the agility shortcut, then run west to the mine.\n\n[[File:Tai Bwo Wannai Trio - The Shaikahan.png|thumb|Tamayu fights the Shaikahan.]]\nOnce you have returned to Tamayu, use the newly poisoned spear and your [[Agility potion|Agility potion(4)]] (it needs to have 4 doses) on him (being careful not to drink the potion). You can now join Tamayu on his hunt and a short [[cutscene]] will play showing Tamayu being successful on his hunt. Once he has slain [[The Shaikahan]] he will promise to return to the village once you've talked with his brothers and father.\n\nTo save some time helping [[Tinsay]], kill a nearby [[monkey]] (with [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]) and use its [[Monkey corpse|corpse]] on [[Tamayu]]. He will ask you if you'd like him to skin it, returning the [[monkey bones]] and [[Monkey skin|skin]] (you only need to save the skin).\n\n===Tinsay===\nNow head to [[Cairn Isle]] in order to talk to [[Tinsay]]. He is located up the rockslide and across the bridge. He'll tell you that he's trying to repair the [[Tribal Statue]] in the village. He has lost his sanity recently due to some sort of accident with a [[Jogre]]. He asks for three special local items.\n\n====Banana rum (if not done beforehand)====\n{{Needed|A [[banana]], [[Karamjan rum]], and a [[knife]]. Note that the knife is not strictly required. A slashing weapon seems to work as well.}}\n\nThe first thing he'll ask you to get him is a bottle of banana-flavoured rum. Head to [[Musa Point]], and buy a bottle of [[Karamjan rum]] from the liquor store there. Then, go into the [[general store]], take the banana and knife off the table and use the knife with the banana to slice it. Add these [[Sliced banana|slices]] to the rum and give it to Tinsay (be careful not to eat the slices).\n\nDo not use a whole banana on the rum without slicing it. It will create a joke item, [[Karamjan rum (banana)]]. If done so you will need to get another bottle of [[Karamjan rum]] to try again.\n\n====Seaweed sandwich====\n{{Needed|[[Seaweed]], and a [[monkey skin]]  or a [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] method to kill a monkey.}}\n\nNext Tinsay wants you to bring him a [[Seaweed sandwich]]. If you do not already have the items cross back over the bridge to collect [[Seaweed]] from the beach and equip your [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] gear in order to kill a [[Monkey]]. Collect the [[Monkey corpse]] and take it back to [[Tamayu]] to be skinned and be given [[Monkey skin]].\n\nOnce you have both items use them on each other to create a [[Seaweed sandwich]] to give to [[Tinsay]].\n\nLike before, do not use a [[monkey corpse]] on the [[seaweed]] before taking the monkey to Tamayu for skinning. This will create another joke item, [[Stuffed monkey]], and you will need to give the stuffed monkey to Tamayu to revert it back to its base components.\n\nAfter you make the seaweed sandwich, use one of the [[karambwan vessel]]s on Tinsay to receive the [[Crafting manual]] for [[Tiadeche]]. He won't accept it until you make the sandwich.\n\n====Marinated jogre bones====\n{{Needed|[[Jogre bones]], a [[raw karambwanji]], a [[pestle and mortar]]. Recommended: [[logs]], and a [[tinderbox]] (for cooking the pasty jogre bones).}}\n\nYou now need to get some burnt jogre bones marinated in karambwanji sauce. '''Be careful not to bury the bones!''' The bones can be accidentally buried at any step in this process.\n\n# Use the jogre bones on a '''tinderbox''' to burn them. It will take a couple of seconds for them to finish burning, after which you can pick them up. If your [[Firemaking]] level is below level 30, you will not be able to burn the jogre bones with a tinderbox. Instead, you will have to burn them in a '''[[furnace]]'''. Alternatively, cast '''[[Superheat Item]]''' on the jogre bones.\n# Grind a [[raw karambwanji]] with your [[pestle and mortar]].\n# Use the [[Karambwanji paste|paste]] on the [[Burnt jogre bones|burnt bones]] to get [[pasty jogre bones]].\n# Cook the pasty jogre bones on a [[range]] or [[fire]] to marinate them, and give the [[marinated j' bones]] to Tinsay. Note: These bones should be green in colour. If you cooked the bones wrong, they will be white instead.\n\nLike before, do not use the karambwanji paste on the jogre bones before burning the jogre bones. This will create another joke item, useless [[marinated j' bones]] (which will be white, not green). You will have to get new jogre bones and karambwanji paste.\n\nNow that you've helped Tinsay, he will regain his sanity and agree to return to Tai Bwo Wannai. Finally, return the [[Crafting manual]] (that was obtained by giving the Karambwan vessel to Tinsay) to Tiadeche, and they will both return to Tai Bwo Wannai.\n\n===Wrapping up===\nAfter you're done with all three brothers, talk to [[Timfraku]] up the ladder in the north-west house of [[Tai Bwo Wannai]] again to complete the quest. Then, talk to each of the three brothers in their houses along the southern fence of the village for additional experience rewards.\n{{Bug|The in-game chatbox message '''incorrectly''' states that [[Tiadeche]] teaches you how to cook karambwan; this is '''not''' true.<br>[[Tinsay]] is the one that teaches you how.}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|image=[[File:Tai Bwo Wannai Trio reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp=2\n|rewards=\n*2,000 [[Coins]] (awarded by [[Timfraku]] immediately upon quest completion)\n*{{SCP|Cooking|5,000}} [[Cooking]] [[experience]] (claimed upon speaking to [[Tinsay]] after quest completion)\n*{{SCP|Fishing|5,000}} [[Fishing]] experience (claimed upon speaking to [[Tiadeche]] after quest completion)\n*{{SCP|Attack|2,500}} [[Attack]] experience, {{SCP|Strength|2,500}} [[Strength]] experience, and a [[Rune_spear#Karambwan_poison|karambwan-poisoned rune spear]] (claimed upon speaking to [[Tamayu]] after quest completion)\n*Access to [[Tamayu's Spear Stall]] (sells [[cleaning cloth]]s)\n*Access to [[Tiadeche's Karambwan Stall]] (sells [[raw karambwan]]s and [[karambwan vessel]]s)\n*The ability to pray at the newly repaired tribal statue (works like an [[altar]]) by talking to [[Tinsay]] and [[Tiadeche]] in the village after the quest\n*The ability to catch and cook karambwans by talking to [[Tinsay]] in the village after the quest\n*The ability to fight the [[The Shaikahan|Shaikahan]] (level 83 - you need a [[Karambwan paste|kp]] [[spear]] to hit it)\n*The ability to use [[Tai bwo wannai teleport]] scrolls\n*The ability to take part in the [[Smithing]] section of the [[Barbarian Training]] [[miniquest]].}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 31 March 2016\n|update = Bugfixes & Combining Tentacles\n|change = The player will now always receive the rune spear(kp) reward from the quest.

He will tell you that he's in love with [[Neite]], but she has no idea what his origins are so she's not interested in him. Talk to [[Gertrude]] (located south of the Cooking Guild, West of Varrock) about Bob's family. While there, your cat will tell you to research a warrior called [[Robert the Strong]].\n\nIn the [[Varrock Palace]] library, talk to [[Reldo]]. He will tell you that Robert the Strong was much taller and stronger than any other man of his time. His longbow was six feet tall, and he fought immortal monsters known as the [[Dragonkin]]. He fought alongside a black panther.\n\nReturn to Bob ('''who might have changed location, use the enchanted Catspeak amulet to locate him'''). You and your [[cat]] will try to convince Bob he is Robert the Strong. Your cat will remind you of the fact that the [[Sphinx]] knows how you were hypnotised, so perhaps it can hypnotise Bob.\n\n===Hidden memories===\n[[File:A Tail of Two Cats - talking to sphinx.png|thumb|The Sphinx talking to Bob the cat in the desert.]]\n'''''Recommended items: [[Nardah teleport]]''' AND coins for the magic carpets (and [[ring of charos]] for discounted rides) OR Desert clothing AND waterskins AND 80gp if you are buying the desert outfit in Sophanem<br />'''Additionally''' you will need a games necklace if you decide to skip the cutscene.''\n\nYou can use the Pharoh's sceptre to get here faster (Jalsavrah teleport is in Sophanem).\n\nIf you haven't gotten the desert outfit, you can buy it from [[Raetul and Co's Cloth Store.]], which can be found east of the [[Sphinx]].\n\nTalk to the Sphinx in [[Sophanem]]. A good way of getting there is to take a magic carpet to Pollnivneach from Shantay Pass and then to Sophanem using Pollnivneach's southern carpet - the Sphinx is south-east of the northern [[Pyramid Plunder|pyramid]]. Ask her for help, and after a bit, you'll have the option to view a five-minute cutscene or get a brief summary of what happens. '''''If you choose the brief summary, you won't be offered the option of being teleported to [[Burthorpe]].'''''\n\nDuring the cutscene, the Sphinx will teleport Bob to Sophanem and hypnotise him. Bob, thinking back on his earliest memories, recalls himself as [[Robert the Strong]]. He sees himself looking over at a tower beside [[Odysseus]], followed by a battle between them and a [[Dragonkin (A Tail of Two Cats)|Dragonkin]]. The Dragonkin manages to slay the panther and weaken Robert, however Robert manages kills the Dragonkin.<gallery captionalign=\"center\">\nBob The Cat Hypnotised.gif|Bob the Cat hypnotised by the Sphinx\nA Tail of Two Cats - dragonkin's castle.png|The Dragonkin on top of its castle.\nA Tail of Two Cats - Odysseus dies.png|Odysseus fighting the Dragonkin, before being killed.\nA Tail of Two Cats - Robert vs the Dragonkin.png|Robert continues to fight the Dragonkin after Odysseus dies.\nA Tail of Two Cats - dragonkin dies.png|Robert finally kills the Dragonkin\n</gallery>\nAfter the cutscene, the Sphinx teleports [[Neite]] to Bob, who will be impressed and fall in love with him. Bob will tell you to keep his owner busy by doing his chores, and you will be given the option to teleport back to Burthorpe (only if you choose to hear the long summary), or stay in Sophanem.\n\n===Bob's list===\n'''''Items required: '''Catspeak amulet (wear it), A vial of water, logs, a tinderbox, a bucket of milk, a chocolate cake, shears, a rake, a seed dibber, 4 potato seeds, Desert shirt or Druid's robe top or Medical gown, Desert robe or Druid's robe.''\n\n'''''Recommended items: '''Varrock teleports, a games necklace''\n\nGo back to [[Unferth]]'s house in [[Burthorpe]] and do these [[chores]]:\n[[File:A Tail of Two Cats - cutting Unferth's hair.png|thumb|One of the chores Bob asks you to do while he is gone.]]\n\n*Tend garden: Using your rake, weed [[Unferth's patch]] in the yard just north of the house and plant four [[potato seed]]s. You now need to wait about 15 – 35 minutes for them to grow. You do not need to water or compost the patch. ''If this is the only remaining chore, you will be alerted by your character or your cat/kitten saying all the chores are finished once the potatoes are done growing.''\n*Tidy house: Make [[bed (A Tail of Two Cats)|Unferth's bed]]. This takes one click and is the easiest chore.\n*Warm human: Use some [[logs]] on the [[fireplace (A Tail of Two Cats)|fireplace]] and light it.\n*Feed human: Use a [[bucket of milk]] and a [[chocolate cake]] on the [[table (A Tail of Two Cats)|table]]. '''Right click your cake! Do not eat it. A slice of cake does not work. Make sure it is the table with a cup and plate on it, NOT the one next to his bed.'''\n*Tidy human: Use a pair of [[shears]] on Unferth to shave his hair. '''Note: The animation takes a couple of seconds, do not click away until he is bald.'''\n\nAfter you've done all of this, talk to Unferth again. He'll tell you that he's very ill and must see a doctor or a nurse. Talk to the [[Apothecary]] in [[Varrock]] (located in the south-west of the city). He will tell you that Unferth is a {{wp|hypochondria|hypochondriac}} - he thinks that he's sick all the time even though he really has been tested for illnesses and it's all in his head. You need to use a placebo on him - pick a [[doctor's hat]] or [[nurse hat]] from the Apothecary, and wear some white robes (princess robes and graceful outfit don't work).\n\nGo back to Unferth's house, and give him a [[vial of water]]. His illness will clear up. '''Note:''' You can't be wielding a weapon/shield; otherwise, Unferth won't believe you.\n\n===Love-cats ===\nUsing your [[catspeak amulet]], find [[Bob (cat)|Bob]] again and talk to him. Log out and log in again if he is not in the same place as before, he will reappear. He may have moved to another of the other locations mentioned above, or he may be in the same location as before. You'll see a cutscene showing all the adventures Bob takes [[Neite]] on, including a [[magic carpet]] ride in [[Sophanem]], a conversation between Bob and the [[King Black Dragon]] (a player spoof known as [[R4ng3rNo0b889]] also tries to attack the dragon, but the dragon kills him instantly), and a journey on the [[Fishing Trawler]] ship.\n\nAfter the cutscene, you will be teleported in front of [[Unferth]]'s house.

This is unique in that Dragon Slayer II is the only quest that Juna has two lines of dialogue for, and this is her only dialogue that pertains to two quests that are independent of each other.\n*The name of the quest \"A Tail of Two Cats\" is a reference to the Charles Dickens novel ''{{wp|A Tale of Two Cities}}''.\n* When you first speak to Bob he says \"Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind\". This line is spoken by Helena to Lysander in Shakespeare's ''{{wp|A Midsummer Night's Dream}}''.\n*In the second cutscene, there is a spoof scene of the film ''{{wp|Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic}}''; Bob is standing on the bow of the ship and says \"I'm king of Gielinor!\"\n*Upon examining the potato plants in Unferth's house, it says \"You say Potato, I say Poh-tar-to\". This is a reference to a 1937 film ''{{wp|Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance}}''.\n*When starting the quest and asking Unferth when they had last seen Bob, they respond with \"Well he usually comes back to me once a week. Usually on a Wednesday a bit before lunchtime\". This is a reference to game updates which usually happen on a Wednesday at this time as Bob spawns next to Unferth, explaining why Bob returns once a week when the servers are rebooted with a game update.\n*Just before getting hypnotized, Bob responds to the claim he is Robert the Strong with \"I'm just this cat you know\". This is a reference to {{WP|The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy}}, where Zaphod Beeblebrox (the self-declared most interesting being in the universe) is described by his psychiatrist as being \"just zis guy, you know?\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{A Tail of Two Cats}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Tail of Two Cats, A}}"

(fairy ring {{Fairycode|DJR}}) Ask him if he needs any help, and he will tell you that his ancestor, Magnus Rimor, led an expedition to [[Mount Quidamortem]] in the [[Kebos Lowlands]] over a thousand years ago, and never returned, with the records declaring he perished along with the party.\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - talking to Phileas.png|thumb|270px|A player talks to Phileas in his home.]]\nHowever, a few days ago, he received a parcel from an unknown individual containing an [[Shayzien journal|old journal]] written by King Shayzien VII, with a note on the parcel claiming the journal was stolen from the [[Tower of Magic]] during the uprising against [[Xeric]] in the 47th decade. Although most of the journal is illegible, he managed to find an extract stating \"''Quidamortem's creatures are compatible. The experimentation is proving successful and we will soon be ready to mass produce.''\"\n\nThe extract had a date in the 37th decade, and yet the expedition was declared a failure a decade before, leading Phileas to question why the king wrote about Quidamortem a decade after the failure of the expedition. He will ask you to discover the truth about his ancestor's expedition; agree to help him. He will ask you to try and learn more about the expedition by visiting the [[Library Historical Archive]].\n\n===Perhaps the archives are incomplete===\n{{Needed|A [[melee]] weapon, a [[ranged]] weapon with ammunition (darts and throwing knives also work), and runes to cast any [[magic]] [[combat spell]]. '''Note:''' Bring enough [[runes]] for more than one cast - it's possible to \"fail\" the attack spell. A [[swamp lizard]] or equivalent may be used; just swap between each combat style.}}\n\nGo to the [[Arceuus Library]], and teleport to the Archive via [[Archeio]] on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}. Speak to [[Pagida]], who has been investigating King Shayzien VII's additions to the [[Tower of Magic]].\n\nSpeak to [[Pagida]], and he will tell you that King Shayzien VII spent more time in the Tower of Magic than any other King, and oversaw construction of various new sections, including a prison, which was built around the same time as the expedition, but has been abandoned for many years. You will ask if you can access the prison, and he will agree to do so.\n\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - cleansing crystals.png|thumb|right|Cleansing the crystals in the Tower of Magic's prison.]]\nThe prison contains a strange device in the centre that can be pushed towards the north, east, south and west. Players can obtain a [[dusty note]] (optional) by searching the skeleton to the south-west part of the prison. The note provides clues of the objective, which is to have all the crystals cleansed in order to open the north prison door:\n\n*Push the device as far west as you can, then stand on the north side of the device and attack the device using magic.\n**'''Note: Attacking the [[Strange Device (Tale of the Righteous)|Strange Device]] with [[ice spells]] will result in the player being unable to push the device for the duration of the freeze effect.'''\n*Then, standing on the south side of the device, attack it using melee (your fists do not work, you need a melee weapon equipped).\n**'''Note: If this doesn't work, make sure your NPC Attack Options are not hidden'''\n*Push the device all the way east, and attack the device using ranged from its south side.\n\n'''Note: You must bring all 3 attack styles with you at the same time. If you have to leave this area only partially completing it, you will have to redo this segment again.'''\n\nOnce all the crystals have been cleansed, the prison doors to the north will open. Investigate the skeleton inside, and the player will read some writings carved into the floor stating, \"''Lizards on the mountain. Do not trust the King. The altar is a lie.\"''\n\n===Another expedition===\n{{Needed|A [[pickaxe]] and [[rope]]. [[Equipment]] and [[food]] to defeat a level 46 enemy. '''Note:''' Bring an [[antipoison]] for your fight with the corrupt lizardman. 20 coins if using the minecart to Mount Quidamortem.}}\n\nReturn to [[Phileas]], and tell him of your discovery. He will ask that you attempt the same expedition in order to find out what the original team discovered, and asks you to speak to [[Lord Shiro Shayzien]] in the [[Shayzien Encampment]].\n\n[[File:Path to Raids.png|thumb|280px|Getting to Mount Quidamortem from the Shayziens' Wall.]]\nMake your way to the [[War Tent]] within the encampment, and climb the ladder inside to reach Lord Shayzien on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}}. You will ask him if you can go on an expedition to Mount Quidamortem. He will agree on the condition that any discoveries made are to be brought to him first, as King Shayzien VII was his ancestor and he wants to be made aware of any discoveries that may present him in a bad light.\n\nHead to the top of [[Mount Quidamortem]]. You can use fairy ring {{Fairycode|BLS}} or a minecart to get closer. You should bring food and some type of [[antipoison]] as you will run past various aggressive, poison-inflicting [[lizardmen]] on the trip to the mountain regardless of your player level. After you arrive at the peak, speak to [[Historian Duffy]] in the tent to the east (the water symbol on the map) (whilst you are here, you can speak to the [[mountain guide]] to unlock the ability to quick travel to and from the [[Shayziens' Wall]]). You will tell him of the dusty note you found in the prison, leading him to believe that the lizardmen were not of natural origin and have existed before [[Xeric]] did.\n\nHe will tell you that a crevice to the west of the mountain was recently uncovered, and that it may lead to what you are searching for. Make your way to the west of the mountain, and use your rope on the crevice. Enter the crevice to find yourself in a [[Quidamortem Cave|red cave]]. Mine the first boulder with a pickaxe, and push the second boulder.\n\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - fighting Corrupt Lizardman.png|thumb|left|250px|Fighting the corrupt lizardman.]]\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - inspecting Unstable Altar.png|thumb|250px|A player inspects the unstable altar, and hears a mysterious voice.]]\nUpon walking close to the magic gate, a [[Corrupt Lizardman]] will appear and attack you. '''The corrupt lizardman will deal poison like the other lizardmen, so an antipoison will be useful. If you die at this battle your grave appears outside of the crevice.''' Defeat it, and inspect the [[Unstable Altar]] past the gate. You will hear a [[Mysterious Voice]] exclaiming \"''Rickard! Turn away! Don't do this!''\", but you will be unable to make sense of it.\n\nReturn to Duffy and tell him of your discoveries in the [[Quidamortem Cave|cave]]. The museum expedition will then travel into the cave; follow them. Once inside the cave, speak to Duffy. He will tell you the cave does indeed predate Xeric, and wonders if it was King Shayzien VII who created the lizardmen. He will add that some believe the two are one and the same. He will then tell you to speak to [[Gnosi]].\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - cave temple.png|thumb|250px|The temple housing an unstable altar.]]\nSpeak to Gnosi who is nearby. She will tell you the reason Xeric ruled Great Kourend unopposed for over a century was because of the power of the [[Dark Altar]], and that he came to Mount Quidamortem to construct the [[Chambers of Xeric]] after his exile. Gnosi believes the reason Xeric survived in Quidamortem is the unstable altar nearby, which appears to give off the same power as the Dark Altar. She further states that it was created to amplify the Dark Altar's power, allowing it to reach areas it previously could not. As it is still giving out power, Gnosi wonders if Xeric had used it to extend his lifespan. She will then tell you to report these findings to the [[Arceuus Library|Library]], but you tell her that Lord Shayzien asked you to report to him first should any discoveries be made.\n\n===Finishing up===\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - Phileas house trashed.png|thumb|right|Phileas' house has been trashed, and he has mysteriously disappeared!]]\nReturn to [[Lord Shiro Shayzien]] (talk to the [[Mountain Guide]] to make the journey faster if you don't have a teleport or the [[Lovakengj Minecart Network]]) and inform him of your discovery. He will ask for proof, and asks you to visit [[Phileas]] for the journal. Return to Phileas, only to find that his house has been trashed and he himself has gone missing.\n\nReturn to Lord Shayzien once more, and he will open an investigation into Phileas' disappearance.

The fastest way there is by teleporting with an [[Ectophial]] to the [[Ectofuntus]] (or fairy ring {{Fairycode|alq}} if [[Ghosts Ahoy]] has not been completed), and then taking the rowboat run by [[Andras]] to the north for 10,000 coins - this will bring you just north of the Theatre. Alternatively you can travel to [[Burgh de Rott]] via either the Shades of Mort'ton minigame teleport, [[Mort'ton teleport]], [[Barrows Teleport]] or {{Fairycode|bip}} ({{SCP|Agility|50|link=yes}}), then taking the boat on the south-eastern dock of [[Burgh de Rott]]. Climb up the rocks and run along the wall until you get to the part of the wall that turns north. Right-click to climb down the gap in the floorboard that you created in Darkness of Hallowvale. Run north from the ground floor and climb up the wall rubble. Run north-east through Meiyerditch (you '''don't''' need to follow the Myreque hideout route to get to the Theatre of Blood). You can also follow the road south from Port Phasmatys, past Slepe, but this is a lot of walking.\n\nTalk to [[Garth (Theatre of Blood)|Garth]] inside [[Ver Sinhaza]], just outside the entrance to the Theatre. Garth will ask if you are interested in hearing the tale of [[Serafina]]. He will briefly describe the connection between Serafina and the Theatre of Blood to you. During the conversation, you will see [[Vanstrom Klause]] and [[Ranis Drakan]] entering the Theatre. You will remark that [[Safalaan]] and the [[Myreque]] should be informed.\n\nHead to the [[Myreque base]] quickly via this route:\n*Speak to a [[Vyrewatch]] and ask to be sent to the mines - there is one just next to the bank booths.\n*Mine 15 [[Daeyalt ore]]s; once the mine cart is full, speak to a [[Vampyre Juvinate]] to leave. If you have no pickaxe, talk to a miner to obtain a [[Bronze pickaxe|bronze]] one.\n*You will appear up on the surface. On the right is a map of the route to take to get to the hideout; follow the blue path down to the leftmost green dot.\n*From here, follow the old route: climb up the ladder, jump east to the floorboards, climb down the stairs, and go south-east through the hidden door.\n*Press the decorated wall and reveal a hidden trapdoor by right-clicking and opening the lumpy rug.\nGo down the trapdoor and walk north to speak to [[Safalaan]], and inform him of what you saw. He tells you that while [[Ranis]] regularly visits Ver Sinhaza to spectate, [[Vanstrom]] has never visited it and thus deems it worth investigating. He sends you to speak to some of [[King Roald]]'s [[Mercenary (Theatre of Blood)|mercenaries]] at the south-east corner of [[Ver Sinhaza]]. Return to the theatre via whichever method you prefer, and speak to any of the mercenaries. They will tell you that both Ranis and Vanstrom are still there, and that you can spy on them via one of the windows in the castle.\n\n===Vampyric espionage===\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Climbing roof.png|thumb|right|A player is blasted with boiling hot steam while attempting to climb a rooftop vent.]]\n{{Needed|recommended=[[Ectophial]] and 10,000 [[Coins]] (to return to [[Ver Sinhaza]]), [[Pickaxe]] (to return to the Myreque hideout via the mines). As there will not be any bank nearby when you reach the next section of the quest, also consider bringing the recommended items for the next two sections: [[pestle and mortar]], [[vial of water]], [[knife]] or [[sickle]], battle gear for shorter trip back to the hideout, weapon to fight a Combat Level 149 monster, [[super restore]] potion|1,000 [[Coins]]}} \nYou will now need to get up onto the top of the [[Theatre of Blood]]. Return to [[Ver Sinhaza]] with whichever method you prefer. Go to the south-west corner, just west of the bank, and try to climb up the rubble at the base of the wall, but the nearby [[vyrewatch]] will stop you. Talk to [[Harpert]] nearby, who will distract the guard if you provide him with 1,000 [[coins]]. A bank is nearby if you do not have the coins on you.\n\nClimb up the rubble, and follow the wall around to the north. The [[Vent (Ver Sinhaza)|vents]] are like obstacles that need to be climbed up and down. Take care when climbing up and down the vents (they occasionally blow out boiling hot steam, which will deal 15-20 [[Hitpoints]] of damage and knock you back down), and then east (you will climb up and down sections of the roof), until you reach a [[Window (Ver Sinhaza)|red window]] that you can look through. A short cutscene will play in which [[Ranis]] and [[Vanstrom]] speak with [[Verzik Vitur]], who gives them an [[abomination]] to help track down the [[Myreque]]. Watching the cutscene will refill your health, prayer and [[run energy]].\n\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Meeting with Verzik.png|thumb|right|The vampyres meet with Lady Verzik Vitur.]]\nReturn to [[Safalaan]]  at the Myreque Hideout, and report what you saw. He will begin formulating a plan with [[Vertida]], and asks you to speak with [[Flaygian Screwte]], the head researcher translating the [[Haemalchemy]] book you obtained during [[Darkness of Hallowvale]]. Flaygian is in the same room as Safalaan. He will explain that the [[vampyres]] were experimenting on both humans and vampyres in order to increase the amount of blood they can harvest from humans, and to strengthen their immunities to human attacks. You will draw a connection from this fact to the weakness that [[Serafina]] potentially discovered. Speak to Safalaan once more.\n\n===The myth of Serafina===\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Route to Serafina's home.png|thumb|right|The route to Serafina's home from the mines or the Myreque Hideout.]]\n{{Needed|[[Pestle and mortar]], [[vial of water]] (both obtainable during quest) [[knife]] or [[sickle]]. [[battle gear]] for shorter trip back to hideout.}}\nAfter speaking to [[Flaygian Screwte]], speak again to [[Safalaan]] who plans to have his team meet up with [[Veliaf Hurtz]]'s in [[Burgh de Rott]] and escape [[Morytania]] in order to build up their numbers, as Morytania may not be safe anymore for them to hide in. You will ask him about [[The Maiden of Sugadinti|Serafina]], and he will tell you [[Old Man Ral]] used to tell stories about her and will reveal to you where she used to live. '''Check your quest log before leaving, as you may be asked to speak with [[Flaygian]] before you can proceed.'''\n\nUpon exiting the [[Myreque Hideout|hideout]], climb up the stairs, jump the gap and then climb down the ladder. From there, head due north through the three doors in a line, then due west until you reach the wall. From there, head north-west to reach a [[Broken Fountain|broken fountain]]. Climb down the stairs in the building directly south to meet up with Safalaan once more (''Optional: Search the bed by the stairs to obtain an [[old diary]]''). He will express his frustration with the tale of Serafina, as he believes it gives the citizens of Morytania a sense of false hope. He will then tell you the locked door in the room may contain what they are seeking.\n\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Serafina's home.png|thumb|right|The player and Safalaan in Serafina's home.]]\nSearch the crates and the barrels for a [[mysterious meat]], [[mysterious herb]], a [[vial]] and a [[pestle and mortar]]. If you've brought your own pestle and mortar and vial of water, you only need to search the crate and barrel in the north-east and north-west corners of the basement; a vial is in the crate in the south-east corner and a pestle and mortar in the south-west corner crate next to the stairs. Once you have these items, use the vial on the broken fountain north of the house to get a vial of water. Add the herb to create an [[Unfinished potion (A Taste of Hope)|unfinished potion]], then crush the meat with the pestle and mortar and use it on the unfinished potion. Use the finished [[Potion (A Taste of Hope)|potion]] on the door, but nothing will happen. Talk to Safalaan again with an empty vial, and he will give you a [[Vial of blood (A Taste of Hope)|vial of blood]]. Use another herb on the vial to create an [[unfinished blood potion]], then add the mysterious crushed meat to complete the [[blood potion]]. Use this on the door to unlock it. Take the [[Old notes (A Taste of Hope)|old notes]] from the chest, then give them to Safalaan.\n\n===It's a trap!===\n{{Needed|A [[weapon]], super restore and some [[food]] to fight a level 149 monster.}}\n{{Instance}}\n{{Bug|There is a bug that may prevent Ultimate Ironmen death pile from appearing should they die in this instance. It is strongly recommended to bring extra supplies or a one-click teleport to prevent this. Bug can also happen to regular players, who may then reclaim items from death}}\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Safalaan unleashes hidden power.gif|thumb|upright|Safalaan unleashes a hidden power, heavily weakening the abomination.]]\nHead back to the [[Myreque Hideout|hideout]], and speak to [[Safalaan]]. As you are all about to leave the hideout, [[Flaygian]] will tell you that the notes were complete nonsense. Safalaan will realise that he has been tricked by [[Vanstrom]] into giving up his blood at Serafina's house and prompts everyone to leave at once. However, it is too late, and the [[abomination]] reaches the base. It will kill [[Mekritus A'hara]], [[Andiess Juip]] and [[Flaygian Screwte]]. As it is about to attack Safalaan, he will levitate and emit a strange, cyan glow, which is amplified before producing a large explosion of power, weakening the [[abomination]]. [[Vertida]] will help you defeat the creature, but keep in mind his damage output is low.\n\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Fighting Abomination.png|thumb|left|The player and Vertida fight the weakened abomination.]]\nThe abomination uses [[melee]] and [[ranged]] attacks. Additionally, the monster will occasionally launch a black projectile which will drain the player's stats by up to 3, so bring a [[restore potion]] to restore combat stats or [[super restore]] for additional [[Prayer]] point restoration. It has very low [[Magic]] Defence, a relatively high [[Ranged]] Defence, and moderate melee defence in every style.\n\nIt is possible to safespot it by hiding behind the brick wall and allowing it to attack Vertida, hitting it again will cause it to be aggressive towards you. If safespotting, [[Protect from Missiles]] can be used to avoid taking any damage. \n[[File:Abomination safespot.png|thumb|Safespotting the Abomination.]]\nThere is a safespot available that avoids attacks from the [[Abomination]], by going south out of the room, then east along the northern side wall to safespot it in the room's entrance. An attack range of 9 or 10 is required, or using a Magic spell, to be out of range if it attacking, this method doesn't require Prayers or food.\n\n===The legendary weapon===\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Old Myreque base.png|thumb|right|The old Myreque base.]]\n{{Needed|[[Rod of ivandis]] (you will get it back if you gave it to Veliaf at the end of In Aid of the Myreque), [[emerald]], [[chisel]]; either 3 [[air rune]]s and 1 [[cosmic rune]] or an [[Enchant emerald or jade]] tablet|recommended=[[Combat equipment]]}}\nOnce the fight is over, [[Safalaan]] and [[Vertida]] will ask you to meet at their old base, a small room underneath [[Old Man Ral]]'s house accessible via a [[trapdoor (Old Man Ral's house)|trapdoor]] in the north room. Old Man Ral's house is easily accessed by taking the boat from [[Burgh de Rott]], going over the wall and running north-east. Once there, talk to Safalaan, who will insist on leaving. Vertida will then interject, telling him that [[Flaygian]] had managed to translate more of the book while you and Safalaan were investigating Serafina's home.\n\nSpeak to Vertida, who will give you [[Flaygian's notes]]. Read them, and discover that a weapon that may be effective against the [[Vyrewatch]] is a flail of some kind, with the [[rod of Ivandis]] being suitable as the flail's shaft. Search the nearby crates to find a [[silver sickle (b)]] and a [[chain]]. The rod of Ivandis can be obtained from [[Veliaf Hurtz]] in Burgh de Rott (under the pub), or can be made by the player again should they choose to do so. '''You need to have talked to Vertida about the Rod of Ivandis otherwise Veliaf Hurtz won't give it to you.'''\n\n#Attach the emerald to the sickle to create an [[emerald sickle (b)]].\n#Then, cast [[Lvl-2 Enchant]] on the emerald sickle, or use an [[enchant emerald or jade]] [[tablet]] on it.\n#Finally, use the chain on the [[Enchanted emerald sickle (b)|enchanted emerald sickle]] or the Rod of Ivandis to create the [[Ivandis flail]].\n\nWhen you have the flail, speak with Safalaan, who will have [[Kael]] tell you that the vampyres believe that the [[Myreque]] has been completely defeated by the [[abomination]], and [[Ranis Drakan]] intends to deliver this news to all of [[Meiyerditch]] at [[Ver Sinhaza]]. Safalaan proposes to confront Ranis during this speech.\n\n===The Taste of Hope===\n{{Instance|irs=at the chest located north-west of the noticeboard|cost=20000}}\n'''Note:''' ''This is a very hard boss fight, so bring enough high-quality [[food]], [[prayer potions]], and combat boosts!''\n\n'''Note:''' ''[[Rings of recoil]] do not work on this boss.\n\nReturn to [[Ver Sinhaza]] (it is just a short walk east from Old Man Ral's house) and speak with [[Kael]] to begin the final fight with [[Ranis Drakan]]. Kael can be found near the entrance. Should players need to escape from the fight, the [[Meiyerditch]] citizen directly behind the player can be right-clicked to quickly escape.\n\n[[Ranis Drakan]] is level 233, and can only be harmed by the [[Ivandis flail]]. He will use [[melee]] and [[magic]] attacks that can hit up to 20, and can even hit through [[Protection prayers|Protection Prayers]], although they will reduce damage taken by 50%. He can also cast [[Blood Barrage]], which will heal himself for half of the damage dealt. Occasionally, he will charge an attack and explode, hitting up to 30, which can be reduced to 6 by '''running away''' until he explodes.\n\nAfter he reaches 65% of his health, he'll summon two level 87 [[vyrewatch]] and will fly airborne. Every now and then, he will throw blood bombs at where you are currently standing, which can hit up to 40. '''Move away from the tile you were standing on when it was launched''' to avoid damage. This attack ''can'' hit the vyrewatch if they are on the landing tile, so it can be used to aid combat, especially at lower levels. When you kill the vyrewatch, you will fight Ranis again until he reaches 25% of his health, where he will then summon two vyrewatch again.\n\nAfter killing them, he will go berserk and attack the player. During this last phase, his attacks are much faster and accurate, but only have a max hit of 6. Using [[Protect from Melee]] will easily defeat him in the last phase. Running away from him between your attacks will allow you to mitigate some damage if necessary.\n\nSome tips for lower level or struggling players:\n\n* When facing Ranis alone,  equip magic-resistant gear, such as [[Dragonhide armour|Dragonhide]] (blue or better) and/or [[Blessed dragonhide armour|Blessed d'hide]], and pray [[Protect from Magic]], approaching Ranis only after he has attacked with a magical attack or charge-up attack, avoiding his melee attacks entirely thus mitigating the damage taken throughout the fight. \n* Since Ranis has the [[Vampyre (attribute)#Tier 3 Vampyres|Tier 3 Vampyre attribute]], [[Efaritay's aid]] can be used for a +15% accuracy bonus for the majority of the fight before breaking. \n* [[Blessed dragonhide armour|Blessed d'hide]] also provides a prayer bonus for each piece equipped (up to 6 total) for a maximum of 20% slower prayer drain, on top of its already high Magic and Melee defence. This makes it an excellent choice for the fight. A lower level alternative is the [[Mixed hide]] set and [[red spiky vambraces]], giving melee strength bonus and both magic and melee defence.\n* Despite the [[Blessed shield|Blessed shield's]] extra Magic defence and Prayer bonus, it may be better to bring a [[Melee]] shield, such as a [[Rune kiteshield|Rune]] or [[Dragon kiteshield|Dragon]] Kiteshield. This is because the shield only offers 15 Magic defence and 18 [[Slash weapons|Slash]] defence (Ranis hits with Slash for Melee), while the kiteshields have a  -1 Magic defence and 46/60 slash defence respectively.\n* If your [[Attack]] level is several levels below 70, you will hit Ranis less often and drag out the length of the fight. In this case, a multi-dose [[Super Attack Potion]] or [[Super combat potion|Super Combat potion]] can help to supplement the lower accuracy.\n** If you would rather bring as much food as possible instead of potions, you can drink your potions at the nearby bank, then swap them for food right before starting the fight.\n* It is recommended to bring high healing food, such as [[Shark|Sharks]] and [[Manta ray|Manta rays]]. Even with high combat stats, Ranis hits up to 20 on his attacks and occasionally casts [[Blood Barrage]] which can undo some of the player's damage if it hits. This means that the fight will almost always take 10+ minutes of non-stop combat.\n* It may be worth using  [[Super restore|Super Restore Potions]] over [[Prayer potion|Prayer potions]], as Super Restore potions restore more Prayer-per-dose compared to Prayer potions, at the cost of a higher buying price from the [[Grand Exchange]].\n* If [[Prayer]] is not an issue, it may be worth using other prayers such as [[Incredible Reflexes]], [[Ultimate Strength]] or [[Piety]] to improve your combat stats even further.\n* When fighting the [[Vyrewatch]],  move one tile opposite of a Vyrewatch such that the Vyre will replace your tile as Ranis casts his Blood Bombs. This will speed up the fight and kill the Vyrewatch faster.\n* During the first two phases of the fight, Ranis never moves, meaning if you aren't standing next to him on the tick before he attacks, he will never melee you. Therefore, if you protect from mage, you will never get hit off prayer by melee for these parts of the fight, making you take far less damage. Both you and Ranis are on a 5-tick attack cycle, so the pattern required to do this strategy should feel intuitive enough even for newer players looking to beat the fight with low stats.\n* During the final phase of the fight, turn on sprint if it isn't on already and sprint at least 2-3 tiles away from Ranis every time you land a hit to reduce the amount of hits landed on you, as even with good gear and [[Protect from Melee]] active, Ranis is very accurate.\n\nAfter killing Ranis, you will give an inspirational speech to the Meiyerditch citizens. If you disconnect after killing Ranis, talk to Kael again to restart the cut-scene with your speech.\n\n<gallery>\nA Taste of Hope - Confronting Ranis.png|The player confronts Ranis Drakan during his announcement.\nA Taste of Hope - Fighting Ranis Drakan.png|The player confronts Ranis Drakan with the Ivandis flail.\nA Taste of Hope - Ranis' blood bomb.png|Ranis launches his blood bomb attack.\n</gallery>\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Finishing up===\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Vanescula and Vanstrom.png|thumb|right|Vanescula and Vanstrom discover Ranis' corpse.]]\nReturn to the [[Myreque Hideout|hideout]] under [[Old Man Ral]]'s house, and talk to [[Safalaan]]. He will congratulate you on defeating [[Ranis]], giving real hope to the citizens of [[Meiyerditch]].

It was added to A Taste of Hope one month later with the release of [[Theatre of Blood]].\n*The title of the quest is a reference to a {{RSL|A Taste of Hope|book}} obtained during the ''{{RSL|RuneScape}}'' quest: {{RSL|The Lord of Vampyrium}}, the sixth instalment in the Myreque questline. The book is [[Lord Drakan]]'s description of the eight vampyre houses and their blood preferences described in the manner of a wine connoisseur. A [[A taste of hope (book)|copy of the book]] was later made available in ''Old School RuneScape'' after the release of the quest's sequel, [[Sins of the Father]], with some minor alterations to the text to fit Old School's lore.\n*This is the first quest which deviates from an established ''RuneScape'' questline. In ''RuneScape'', the fourth instalment of the Myreque questline is {{RSL|Legacy of Seergaze}}. The quest itself derives a number of elements from a number of Myreque quests with some minor differences:\n**The {{RSL|Morytanian splinter group}} introduced in Legacy of Seergaze is completely omitted. According to Mod Ed, this was because Mod Tytn, who developed the original story in ''RuneScape'', had misinterpreted the [[Edicts of Guthix]], causing his interpretation of them to not match up with any other reference of them in both games.\n**[[Flaygian Screwte]] still helps guide the player create the [[Ivandis flail]], albeit in the form of [[Flaygian's notes]] after his death. In Legacy of Seergaze, Flaygian remains alive to help the player craft the flail, though he takes a stroll to have some fresh air afterwards and is presumed dead as he never makes an appearance again.\n**The player discovers the rest of the [[Meiyerditch Laboratories]] in A Taste of Hope's sequel, [[Sins of the Father]]. In Legacy of Seergaze, the laboratory is where [[Andiess Juip]] is killed, rather than in the Myreque Hideout.\n**[[Mekritus A'hara]] is killed during the attack on the Myreque Hideout. In ''RuneScape'', he is killed in the penultimate quest of the series, The Lord of Vampyrium.\n**Ranis Drakan is killed by the player in A Taste of Hope. In ''RuneScape'', he is killed by his sister, [[Vanescula Drakan]], after he nearly discovers the player's presence in [[Darkmeyer]] during the sequel to Legacy of Seergaze, {{RSL|The Branches of Darkmeyer}}.\n*During the fight with Ranis at [[Ver Sinhaza]], [[Old Man Ral]] can be seen on the north side of the crowd of Meiyerditch citizens, near the noticeboard.\n*The instanced area in which players fight Ranis can be seen just north of the [[Cosmic entity's plane]] via the use of an [[oculus orb]].\n**Players would not be able to see another player doing the quest, as the fight would take place in an instanced copy generated from the template seen via the oculus orb.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1506587005299404808|date=23 March 2022|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/FUkQr|archivedate=9 April 2022}}\n*The player's dialogue after defeating Ranis is a reference to Agent Smith's dialogue in The Matrix.\n*Prior to defeating Ranis Drakan, his examine text reads, \"He looks haughty and arrogant.\" However, if the player examines Drakan's dead body during the cutscene after the fight, the text instead changes to \"Not so haughty and arrogant any more.\"\n*After attempting to climb the rubble the player can talk to the Vyrewatch and in one of the dialogue options the player will say \"Blimey! The nature of the thing that is happening has changed slightly, rendering it yet more interesting!\".

If not, use Option A. Partial completion is possible, you must only reach the point at which it is possible to obtain the [[Brooch]].'''\n\n====Option A====\nTo start, you need to find [[Juna]] deep inside the caves under the [[Lumbridge Swamp]]. A [[bullseye lantern]] is recommended to get deep enough safely, as a bullseye lantern will not be extinguished, will not explode from swamp gas, and cannot break. You don't have to make it yourself, as a player with high enough [[Smithing]] and [[Crafting]] can put one together for you, but you must be able to [[Firemaking|light]] it yourself. Before you enter the caves, use a cut [[sapphire]] on the bullseye lantern to get a [[sapphire lantern]]. If you do not do this now you will not be able to swap in the caves, as you cannot extinguish your lantern in the cave in order to replace the lens. This sapphire lantern will also light the caves. If you go to Juna's cave through the normal route, as you pass by [[Wall beast|holes in the wall]], stop one square away from them; then, run past them. You will not be grabbed by the wall beasts if you use this method.\n\nYou can enter the cave from the swamp (first time entry requires a [[rope]]), travelling south, then hugging the south wall all the way until there's a place where you can jump on a rock to cross a small, subterranean river. On the way, you will pass by a room where swamp gas will blow up any open flames you are carrying on you if you take too long to go past, each one hitting 10-15 damage. Watch for a grey 'X' marked on the northern side of a wall, this is the room. South of the [[Giant frog|frogs]] is a cave entrance. From there, head east, climb down the slope, and continue east until you see Juna sitting in front of the cave. Talk to her to begin the quest.\n\nSkip to the '''Juna''' paragraph to continue.\n\n====Option B====\nAs mentioned above, it's a good idea to have a lit [[Sapphire lantern|sapphire bullseye lantern]] made. Since you have at least started [[The Lost Tribe]] quest, you won't need the spiny helmet, you can just go to the basement of [[Lumbridge Castle]], climb through the hole in the wall, head south, and then squeeze through the hole to get into the cave (right-click use on your pickaxe on the second hole to clear the pathway). From there, head straight south to the [[Giant frog|frogs]] and then jump across the stepping stone at the southern river, and enter another tunnel at the south. From there, head east, climb down the rocky slope, and continue east until you see [[Juna]] sitting in front of the cave. If you are carrying a weapon be sure to have it unequipped when you talk to Juna to be able to tell her a story. Talk to her to begin the quest.\n\n===Juna===\nWhen you talk to [[Juna]], she will tell you some stories about the Tears and tell you of how very bored she has become. Also you need to tell a story for her to be able to continue the quest. She's willing to let you into the cave for a little while to gather some of the miraculous Tears of Guthix, but first, she has a task for you. To collect the tears, you will need a [[stone bowl]]. Getting there will be a bit tricky, though, since you can't quite climb up to where the rocks you need are.\n\n===The Light Creatures===\n[[File:Riding light creature.png|thumb|Riding a light creature.]]\nHead north-west of [[Juna]] up the path toward the direction you came from, and climb the rocks. In the big black middle area are a group of floating orbs of light called [[light creature]]s. Use your lit [[sapphire lantern]] on one of them, the creature will pick you up and give you a ride to the south side where the [[magical rocks]] are.\n\n===The Bowl===\nUse your [[pickaxe]] to get a [[Magic stone (Tears of Guthix)|magic stone]], and then use your [[chisel]] to craft it into a [[Stone bowl|bowl]]. One will be enough. If the player did not tell Juna a story, then the player will receive a message \"You don't know what to make.\" and will be unable to make a Stone bowl. Now, head east to climb back down and then go back to Juna. Give the bowl to her, and your quest is complete.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\nYou can now reacquire the sapphire used when making your sapphire lantern by using the lantern with your lantern lens.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Tears of Guthix\n|image = [[File:Tears of Guthix reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Crafting|1,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*Ability to play the [[Tears of Guthix (minigame)|Tears of Guthix minigame]] once a week\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Tears of Guthix is required for the following:\n* [[While Guthix Sleeps]]\n* [[Hard Lumbridge & Draynor Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n{{Tears of Guthix}}"

He will give you the [[Pendant of Lucien]] and tell you to visit the [[Temple of Ikov (dungeon)|Temple of Ikov]]. It is located directly south of the [[Ranging Guild]] and west of the [[Sorcerer's Tower]]. When you are there, climb down the ladder. Head through the northern gate of the room while wearing the pendant. Here you will find an unsteady bridge over lava. To successfully cross this bridge, '''your weight needs to be -1 kg or less,''' '''{{Colour|red|or you will fail and take 20 damage!}}''' \n\n'''Note:''' If you still need to reduce your weight, you can obtain the [[boots of lightness]] by climbing down the stairs in the previous room and slashing the web. You will need a light source to enter the cellar.  Wearing these boots reduces your weight by 4.5 kg.\n\nWalk across the bridge and take the [[Lever (Temple of Ikov)|lever]] on the other side. ''Ensure that the lever (0.056 kg) doesn't increase your weight above -1 kg, otherwise you should teleport outside and climb down the ladder again.''\n\nHead back to the initial room, near the entrance ladder, and place the lever on the lever bracket on wall south-west of the ladder. Pull the lever to open the southern room. '''''Warning:''' If you place the lever but do not pull it and then leave the area, the lever will need to be reobtained and replaced.''\n\n===The Ice Chamber===\n{{Needed|Yew bow or higher and 20 unnoted limpwurt roots.|recommended=Ava's Accumulator and Armour or [[Protect from Melee]] }}\n\nAt this point it is advised to equip ranged armour and collect your bow and limpwurt roots if you haven't already, to save a trip to the bank (East Ardougne North bank is nearest if the player has not completed [[Legends' Quest]].)  Move through the southern room to the ice chamber filled with level-61 [[ice spider]]s.\n\nYou need to gather enough [[ice arrows]] in this room to battle the [[Fire Warrior of Lesarkus]]; about 20 arrows are recommended, though you can get by with much less if you have a high Ranged level and an [[Ava's device]]. '''If using darts or throwing knives, only one arrow is needed since you won't be using ice arrows as ammo.''' There are 6 [[Closed chest (Temple of Ikov)|chests]] in this room yet only one of them contains arrows at a time. Each time you loot a chest with arrows, you'll obtain 1-5 arrows, and a chest is randomly selected as the next spawn for the arrows. It is possible for the same chest to contain arrows multiple times in a row or nothing at all.\n\n===Fire Warrior of Lesarkus===\n[[File:Temple of Ikov - Fire Warrior of Lesarkus.png|thumb|right|Duelling the [[Fire Warrior of Lesarkus]].]]\n{{Needed|[[Ice arrows]] and a yew bow or better to wield them '''or''' any [[Ranged#Weapons|thrown weapon]] with at least one [[ice arrow]] equipped, the [[Pendant of Lucien]] and 20 unnoted [[Limpwurt root]]s.|recommended=Ranged armour and [[Protect from Magic]].}}\n\nWhen you have enough ice arrows (about 20), head to the entrance again. Walk once more through the north door with the [[Pendant of Lucien]] equipped, and continue north until you see a small alcove with a lever in it. Right-click the lever to ''Search for traps'', then pull it (requires {{SCP|Thieving|42|link=yes}}). Head through the west passage and through the door.\n\nYou'll enter a room with a summoning mark in the middle of it. Attempt to open the door on the north, and you'll be stopped by the [[Fire Warrior of Lesarkus]]. He will not attack until you either attack him first or finish the dialogue with him. He uses solely magic, so [[Protect from Magic]] comes in handy. '''He can only be damaged with ice arrows; however, thrown weapons (darts, knives, thrownaxes, Toktz-xil-ul, and the Toxic blowpipe) can be used with at least one ice arrow equipped (it will not be lost). If doing this to circumvent the Ranged level requirement, your damage will be poor, so be sure to bring food and consider bringing rings of recoil.''' You can pick up fallen arrows during the fight. In case you use the wrong weapon or run out of ice arrows, he will stop the fight and tells you to come back later. However, he will not regenerate health as long as he is still in the room. Only if you take very long to defeat him or walk too far from the room, he will disappear and you will need to start the fight over.\n\nAfter defeating the Fire Warrior, proceed through the north door. ''In case you have to re-enter the room, you do not need to fight the Fire Warrior again.''\n\nYou'll find [[Winelda]] the witch standing near a stream of lava. She will teleport you across if you hand her 20 unnoted limpwurt roots, '''all given at once'''.\n\nGo past the skeletons until you stand below the room with the [[Guardians of Armadyl]]. You can push a wall to enter that room. You'll then have a choice of how you would like to finish the quest. Both choices have the same reward. The only difference lies in the enemy you have to fight.\n\n'''Note:''' If you continue past the room, south-west down the hallway and past the level-82 [[Lesser demon]]s, you will find a [[Shiny key]].

Lucien is actually an evil [[Mahjarrat]], a very powerful race that follows [[Zamorak]], who has been chasing after the staff for a long time. They will tell you that you must kill Lucien to stop him from coming back, and give you the [[Armadyl pendant]] once you agree to help them.\n\nHead towards Lucien's house which is between [[Edgeville]] and the [[Grand Exchange]]. Defeat him (level 14) while wearing the Armadyl pendant, and your quest is complete.\n\n===Side with Lucien===\nYou may ignore the conversation with the Guardians.

Ask her what she is doing in Al Kharid, and she will tell you she came here to buy something. She will ask you about the [[Abyss]], and you will tell her that you helped the [[Zamorak Magical Institute]] gain access to the rune essence mine, much to her dismay. Regardless, she will ask you if you want to help her with a task; agree to help her to start the quest.\n\nShe will show you an [[eye amulet]] that she purchased for 100 coins from [[Asgarnia Smith]], who found it washed up near the [[Ruins of Uzer]] and sold it to her, believing it to be junk. In reality, the amulet bears the symbol of the [[Order of Wizards]] of the [[Wizards' Tower]] and contains two distinct magical signatures: one of rune essence and one of the Abyss.\n\nShe asks that you find out the origin of the amulet by tracing the Abyssal energy that it contains. However, the spell needed to trace the amulet will only work properly when inside the Abyss. You will need to contact someone within the [[Zamorak Magical Institute|Z.M.I.]] to assist you, though she'll ask you not to disclose how you acquired the amulet.\n\n===Herbert and the Dark Mage===\n{{Needed|Eye Amulet (Obtained during the quest), a Bucket of Water, 1 free inventory slot|recommended=Ring of Dueling or Lumbridge Teleport}}\n[[File:Mage of Zamorak chathead.png|left]]\nHead to the [[Mage of Zamorak]] in the [[Chaos altar (Prayer)#Varrock|Zamorakian chaos altar]] in south-eastern [[Varrock]]. Use the eye amulet on him, and he'll cast an appraisal spell on it. He'll admit that the amulet is indeed unusual, but requests that you bring him a [[bucket of water]] and a [[strong cup of tea]], which can be acquired from the [[Tea Seller]] at the eastern entrance to Varrock.\n\nTalk to the Tea Seller and ask for a strong cup of tea. You will tell him the mage, whose real name is Herbert, asked you to bring him one. In reality, they are just regular cups of tea, and he gives one to you. Return to Herbert with the bucket of water, and use the strong cup of tea on him to continue.\n\n[[File:Temple of the Eye - tracing spell.png|thumb|280px|Runic energies emerge from the rift.]]\nYou will be prompted to teleport to the centre of the Abyss, and Herbert will tell you that the bucket of water is for the [[Dark Mage (Abyss)|Dark Mage]] maintaining the rift, who needs a bath. He will offer you a one-time teleport to the centre of the Abyss. Upon arriving to the Abyss, use the eye amulet on the Dark Mage and you will automatically give him a wash by soaking him with water. He will then cast a spell to triangulate the origins of the amulet, using the rift to compare energy from that origin with energy from the runic altars.\n\nFor his tracing spell to work, you will need to help him work out what order the runic energy from the Abyssal rift goes in. This is randomised for each player; click each rune type until all turn white in order to determine your order (document as you go). You have to return to each energy as you get the order, so for instance the one will turn white, try another energy. If it does not turn white, return to the first one that turned white, once you get that second white that too will need to stay white to move on to the next colour. (for example; if you get Law Energy first, that must stay white, if you try earth and it doesn't turn white you will have to go back to Law Energy before proceeding).\n\nAfter working out the order, he will give you an [[Abyssal incantation]]. Reading the incantation provides the message \"You don't understand the incantation. It needs the knowledge of a wizard.\"\n\n===Help from Some Wizards===\nReturn to Wizard Persten in Al Kharid (exiting the Abyss through the fire rift will bring you north of Al Kharid, just next to the Wizard). She will cast a spell to disable a magical feed the Z.M.I placed on the spell and redirect it to give them false information. She will then tell you to head to [[Archmage Sedridor]] for assistance in opening up wherever the amulet would lead to, and offers you a one-time teleport directly to the [[Wizard's Tower]]. Sedridor can be found in the basement; use the abyssal incantation on him. While skeptical due to the Z.M.I being involved, he casts a spell to ensure that the amulet and incantation is safe. In the meantime, he asks you to speak to [[Wizard Traiborn]], on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the tower.\n\nSpeak to Wizard Traiborn, and ask him for his three wizard apprentices to help you with the incantation. But first, he will ask you to help his apprentices solve a puzzle he gave them. Speak with all three to receive their parts of the puzzle:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Wizard\n!First sentence\n!Second sentence\n|-\n|[[Apprentice Cordelia|Cordelia]]\n|Fire is four and Body is seven.\n|A thingummywut is less than three Water and more than three Air.\n|-\n|[[Apprentice Felix|Felix]]\n|Water is six and Mind is eight.\n|A thingummywut is less than two Body and more than two Earth.\n|-\n|[[Apprentice Tamara|Tamara]]\n|Earth is five and Air is three.\n|A thingummywut is less than three Fire and more than one Mind.\n|}\n\nUsing the clues given, the answer to the puzzle would be 11. Give this answer to Traiborn.\n\n===Enter the Gate===\n[[File:Temple of the Eye - arriving at the Temple of the Eye.png|thumb|280px|Persten and Traiborn's apprentices arrive at an ancient underwater temple.]]\nReturn to the basement and speak to Sedridor. He will confirm that both the incantation and amulet are safe, and will reluctantly agree to help you. A cutscene will play in which Traiborn's apprentices and Persten cast the incantation. A [[Portal (Wizards' Tower)|portal]] will open, and you will enter it with them, arriving at what appears to be an underground Saradominist temple.\n\nTamara will cast a locator spell, and finds that they are south of Morytania, deep below the sea. Explore the temple and speak to all the apprentices, who make various discoveries about the temple. Afterwards, speak to Persten, who examines the markings and tells you that they radiate magical energy she's never encountered before.\n\nYou will then experience a vision of a [[Stone of Jas|Mysterious Stone]], alongside two voices: those of [[Justiciar Zachariah]] and [[Justiciar Aliya]], who discuss guarding the Stone, which they refer to as the Eye. You will randomly proclaim [[Jas]], much to Persten's confusion.\n\nUpon learning of what the apprentices have discovered, Persten concludes that the wizards of the temple used the power of the Abyss and the Eye to create portals to the runic altars. She will then cast a spell in an attempt to reveal additional secrets of the Temple, only for an [[Abyssal Rift (The Scar)|abyssal rift]] to open and suck her inside, with warped abyssal creatures emerging from it. Cordelia will cast a spell to kill the creatures.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nTemple of the Eye - vision of the Mysterious Stone.png|Experiencing a vision of the distant past.\nTemple of the Eye - the wizards convene.png|Persten and Traiborn's apprentices discuss their discoveries.\nTemple of the Eye - Persten disappears.png|Persten accidentally opens a rift, and disappears.\nTemple of the Eye - Cordelia attacks.png|Abyssal creatures begin appearing, and Cordelia casts a powerful spell to kill them.\n</gallery>\n\n===Guardians of the Rift===\n{{Needed|Chisel (Obtainable during the quest), Pickaxe (Obtainable during the quest)}}''Be aware that dropping items on the ground during the tutorial is risky; when going to the runecrafting altars, the instance is refreshed and items dropped are permanently lost''[[File:The Great Guardian chathead.png|left]]\n[[The Great Guardian]] will appear in the centre, and asks that you assist it in closing the rift. This part of the quest serves as a tutorial for the [[Guardians of the Rift]] minigame.\n\nSpeak to Felix and take a [[weak cell]] from the eastern table. Bring it to Tamara, then place it in the inactive cell tile near her to create a barrier.\n\nReturn to Felix, and take a chisel from the table and assemble the essence piles into rune guardians. Afterward, speak to Tamara again, who will ask you to collect guardian fragments and assemble them into essence.\n[[File:Temple of the Eye - The Great Guardian.png|thumb|280px|The Great Guardian explains the origins of the Temple.]]\nOnce the Great Guardian has enough energy to close the rift, a cutscene will play. After closing the rift, the Great Guardian explains to you and the group that the temple was a place to hold the [[Stone of Jas]] and following the [[Betrayal of Zaros]], the servants of [[Zaros]] tried to claim it for themselves during the [[Battle for the Eye]]. As the Eye is no longer in the temple, the rift will eventually return and thus will need the humans' help in closing it. The three apprentices will choose to stay and help the Great Guardian, feeling a need to atone for the mistake. It also presumes that Persten is dead as she has fallen into [[the Scar]], the most dangerous place in the Abyss. The apprentices will then tell you to inform Sedridor of the development.\n\nLeave through the portal and inform Sedridor that the so-called teleportation matrix was instead a rift to the Abyss that Persten had accidentally re-opened and that abyssal creatures spewed out. Sedridor will lament that he had forsaken his own principles due to his reluctance in following Persten's idea. He promises to give Traiborn's apprentices all the help they need in defending the place and research a way to close the rift as they have work to do.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Temple of the Eye\n|image = \n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n* {{SCP|Runecraft|5,000}} [[Runecraft]] experience\n**An additional {{SCP|Runecraft}}4,210 [[Runecraft]] XP is gained during the quest, for a total of 9,210 XP\n* Access to the [[Guardians of the Rift]] minigame\n* A [[medium pouch]] (if not already acquired)\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\n* [[Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire]]\n* [[While Guthix Sleeps]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Developers==\n* '''Main Developer(s):''' [[Mod Ed]] and [[Mod Husky]]\n* '''Art:''' [[Mod Grub]], [[Mod Jerv]] and [[Mod West]]\n\n==Trivia==\n* This quest features the first physical appearance of the [[Stone of Jas]] in ''Old School RuneScape''.\n* If the player has completed [[One Small Favour]], they will mention their trepidation when Wizard Persten asks for their help with a \"little task\".\n*After starting the quest, the player will ask if Wizard Persten is interested in accessing the abyss, to which she'll respond \"Well, yes, but actually no.\". This is a reference to the short film ''So You Want to Be a Pirate!''.\n*After showing the player the amulet, Wizard Persten will say \"A foolish archaeologist by the name of Asgarnia Smith...\". This is a reference to ''Indiana Jones''.\n* While the player is talking to the [[Dark Mage (Abyss)|Dark Mage]], he will be interrupted by someone contacting him via [[NPC Contact]] and asking him to repair their runecrafting pouches. His dialogue is the same as during the standard NPC Contact spell (\"What do you want? Can't you see I'm busy?\").\n*Many players had to complete this quest twice due to the rollback from the [[Untradeable items glitch]]. After the rollback, the dark mage puzzle (unique to each player) did not carry over the same order for each player and needed to be re-solved.\n*In the cutscene and location underwater after you enter the portal, SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick's houses can be seen in the distance. Examining the pineapple states \"Who lives here? In a place like this?\" Examining the head states \"Looks grouchy.\" Examining the rock states \"I wumbo.\"\n\n{{Temple of the Eye}}\n{{Guardians of the Rift}}"

Players may choose to wait and receive it if they wish to read the message for immersion, but it is removed upon completion of the quest.\n\nSpeak to [[Elias White]] at [[Uzer Oasis]] to begin the quest. The quickest way to get there is via [[Fairy rings|fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|DLQ}}, then running eastward towards the coast. Elias will tell you that he has made progress towards [[Arrav]]'s predicament, having discovered information on an unusual form of necromancy that was once practised in the surrounding lands, matching what Arrav is currently suffering from. His research had led him to the [[Uzer Mastaba]], where a Pharaoh Queen, known for her work to save the victims of a Mahjarrat necromancer, is buried. According to Elias, in order to free Arrav from [[Zemouregal]]'s hold, you will need a way to recover his heart while keeping it preserved and beating. As such, he tasks you with searching the mastaba for information on heart preservation, while he works on finding where Arrav's heart is being kept.\n\n=== Tomb Raiding ===\nEnter the [[Uzer Mastaba]] atop the nearby hill. Inside, you will find various dead skeletons littered around the area. Two of these will give the player a [[mastaba key]] when searched: the first is the southernmost skeleton in the cave beyond the first room, while the other is found north-west of the [[stone boat]] in the central chamber. Searching the rest of skeletons will only provide empty [[waterskin]]s, [[damaged armour]], [[Vase (Digsite)|vases]], and [[Dust (item)|dust]]. \n[[File:The Curse of Arrav - fighting golem guard.png|thumb|left|300px|Fighting the golem guard.]]\nThe keys are used automatically when operating the levers in the north-east and south-east corners of the area which are behind wall traps. Ensure you search the odd markings on the walls preceding them to disable the traps and avoid damage, then attempt to pull the levers with the keys in your inventory. If you do not search the odd markings, you will be pierced for up to 19 damage when attempting to walk past them.\n\nOnce the two levers have been pulled, the door to the north will then be unlocked, but the way downstairs is guarded by the [[golem guard]]. It attacks with melee, cannot be safespotted, and has a prayer-piercing special attack. When the game screen shakes and he draws his arms close to his body, it will stand in place and attack three times every two ticks, dealing up to 30 damage per hit; simply move one tile away from the golem guard to avoid this.\n[[File:The Curse of Arrav - crossing tiles.png|thumb|300px|Crossing over the coloured tiles in the mastaba's lower level.]]\nUpon descending the stairs, you will come across a chamber with multiple coloured tiles which raise and block the way, depending on which sets the player stands on. Walk on either the blue and green tiles or the yellow and red tiles on the south side to cross over to the burial chamber; if the wrong pair of tiles are stepped on after starting the crossing, the player will take moderate damage. After crossing to the burial chamber side, pull the lever to disable the coloured tiles.\n\nThe Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber contains multiple statues depicting the lesser gods of the [[Menaphite Pantheon]]. The shelves to the north can be searched to receive a [[Canopic jar (oil)|canopic jar]] filled with sacred oil. Head to the southern chamber where Tumeken's statue is found, and inspect the southern mural, which depicts the canopic jar being filled with three [[dwellberries]] and a [[ring of life]]; use the items in that order on the jar to fill it.\n\nWith the jar in tow, head back to Elias. You can save a bit of time by hopping worlds, which will teleport you back outside the mastaba.\n\n===Fort Invasion===\n{{Needed|A [[pickaxe]]|recommended=[[Trollheim Teleport]], [[stony basalt]] or [[Ghommal's hilt]]; [[stamina potion]], 2 free inventory spaces}}\n\nElias will tell you that one of his contacts spotted [[Zemouregal]] entering an old fort near [[Trollweiss Mountain]], and also found an entrance on the summit that appears to lead right into it. However, he suggests bringing a pickaxe as parts of the tunnels within have been caved in.\n\nMake your way to [[Trollheim]]. Take the path just northwest of Trollheim (towards the [[ice gate]]), then enter the [[Trollweiss Dungeon]] directly west of the ice gate. Activating [[Protect from Melee]] is recommended for lower-levelled players as the [[ice troll]]s can hit up to 21. Follow the path north until you can enter a crevasse to get to the summit of Trollweiss Mountain. Once you've exited the crevasse, run directly east and enter the tunnels.\n[[File:The Curse of Arrav - mining rubble.png|thumb|300px|Mining through the tunnels beneath Trollweiss Mountain.]]\nMine the rubble within the caves to clear the path; certain piles of rubble may need to be mined multiple times to be cleared, while some can only be mined once from each side before they're cleared, so you may have to run around the tunnels to mine the same rubble from different directions in order to clear it. Along the way, you can pick up the [[Stone tablet (The Curse of Arrav)|stone]], [[Granite tablet|granite]], [[Slate tablet|slate]], and [[shale tablet]]s, which depict a Mahjarrat attempting to avoid being chosen as a sacrifice in their ritual.\n\nMine your way to the eastern end of the tunnels to reach the fort's basement. Players can optionally search the bookcases on the eastern wall to receive [[Mahjarrat notes (a-j)]], which are written by Zemouregal and list various living and recently-sacrificed Mahjarrat, as well as his opinions of them.\n\nHead upstairs to find that Arrav is standing before you, warning you to leave before Zemouregal returns. You will ask him about his heart, but he will tell you it is not present in the fort as Zemouregal did not want it too close to his fellow Mahjarrat. However, he will tell you to look behind the flame tapestry in the north-eastern room for something helpful. He is then summoned by Zemouregal, thanking you before he is teleported away.\n\nThe rest of [[Zemouregal's Fort]] is not accessible, so enter the door to the east and search the tapestry. You will receive a [[base key]] and [[base plans]], which depict [[Zemouregal's Base]].\n\n===Hearty Heist===\n{{Needed|A [[Crossbow (weapon)|crossbow]], [[mith grapple]], [[insulated boots]], [[Canopic jar (The Curse of Arrav)|the filled canopic jar]], [[Base key]], [[base plans]], combat equipment (enemy is weak to Crush.)|recommended=[[Digsite teleport]] or [[Lumberyard teleport]] for quick access to Zemouregal's base, [[Stamina potion]], [[anti-venom]], emergency teleport}}\n\nReturn to Elias, who you show the base plans to. He confirms that the base has a chamber marked as containing Arrav's heart, but it is found in the inner section of the base with state of the art security:\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nThe Curse of Arrav - heist cutscene 1.png|Human detection spells...\nThe Curse of Arrav - heist cutscene 2.png|A sewage system accessed via the kitchen...\nThe Curse of Arrav - heist cutscene 3.png|... whose floor is secured by periodic energy surges.\nThe Curse of Arrav - heist cutscene 4.png|A guarded vault door, made of five-inch thick runite-enforced steel, with a four digit access code to boot...\nThe Curse of Arrav - heist cutscene 5.png|Special fire ray enchantments, courtesy of Zemouregal...\nThe Curse of Arrav - heist cutscene 6.png|... leading to a pedestal holding Arrav's heart hostage.\n</gallery>\n\nWhile seemingly daunting, Elias will suggest various measures to bypass the traps: a [[Insulated boots|form of insulation]] from the energy surges, having him distract the zombies guarding the vault door, and a [[Crossbow (weapon)|crossbow]] and [[mith grapple]] to climb over the fire traps.\n\nBefore heading to [[Zemouregal's Base]], bring the required items for the heist, as well as the [[base key]]. Furthermore, players will be forced to enter a fight in which teleportation is the only way of escape. During the fight, players can be inflicted with [[venom]]. As such, take a sip of [[Antidote++]] or similar proactively beforehand or after you are afflicted by venom.\n\n\n'''NOTE: If you're doing this all in one go, bring the [[Canopic jar (The Curse of Arrav)|filled canopic jar]].'''\n\nMake your way to Zemouregal's Base, just west of where the [[Odd Old Man]] is, by your preferred method. Talk to Elias outside the entrance, then enter the base and run through the dungeon until you reach the kitchen (marked by the [[File:Cooking range icon.png|link=]] icon). Enter the kitchen, wear your [[insulated boots]], and then enter the sewer system via the southern wall using the pipe.\n\nHead all the way around the path to the other end of the pipe exit to find yourself at the vault doors, ignore them for now. You can now safely remove/change your insulated boots. Make your way south to the room with three tables. Search the western table for [[decoder strips]], and the chest for the [[code key]]. Optionally, you can search the eastern table for [[Mahjarrat notes (k-z)]], the other half of Zemouregal's writings; this reveals the Mahjarrat who dug the tunnels to his fort was [[Lamistard]]. He was discovered and promptly sacrificed for the ritual.\n[[File:The Curse of Arrav - vault door code input.png|thumb|300px|The code access interface at the vault doors.]]\nRead the code key and take note of the four-letter code. Return north to the vault doors. Attempt to open them. An interface will appear; enter your key code in order on the decoder strips in the interface that pops up (right side of interface). Each strip will be associated with a number, 0-9, and will have an order, 1-4 on the left hand side of the strip. Use the up and down arrows to input the number and the right arrow to enter each number once picked.\n\nFor example, a code key with the code \"DAFE\" would have the player put strip 1 on D, 2 on A, 3 on F, and 4 on E, which reveals the access code to be 9449.\n\nUpon entering the vault, equip your crossbow and mithril grapple, then click on the metal bars above the fire traps to climb over them. There are no further traps here. Attempt to take the heart from the pedestal to initiate a cutscene.\n\n===The Hero of Avarrocka===\n{{Needed|Bring combat equipment, the enemy is weak to Crush.|recommended=[[Stamina potion]], [[anti-venom]], emergency teleport, combat potions to fit your attack style}}\n\nUpon attempting to take the heart, your character turns around to find out that [[Zemouregal]] and [[Sharathteerk]] have discovered your presence and send [[Arrav]] to kill you. Players cannot leave the vault physically as Zemouregal blocks your path, and as such bringing a means to teleport out is recommended in case of an emergency. If you leave, you will need to bring insulated boots to return, but you do not need a mith grapple or crossbow. If you die during the fight with Arrav, your gravestone will be in the caves and you can grab your boots and grapple before trying again.\n[[File:The Curse of Arrav - catching Arrav's axe.mp4|thumb|400px|Players can unequip their weapon and attack Arrav to catch his axe, dealing extra damage to him.]]\nArrav uses a standard melee attack whose damage can be reduced with [[Protect from Melee]]. Every three attacks, Arrav will swing his axe in the direction he's facing, which will rebound back to him, dealing up to 26 damage in both directions. The thrown axe attack has a wind up time, allowing you to move adjacent or behind him and resume attacking; alternatively, you can quickly unequip your weapon and position yourself between Arrav and the axe, allowing you to catch it and strike his chest with a lightning animation for additional damage. When successful, a game message in the chatbox will state {{mes|You catch the flying axe and embed it in Arrav's chest!|colour=#229628}}\n\nAdditionally, [[Armoured zombie (The Curse of Arrav)|armoured zombies]] will also spawn with 10 Hitpoints each, leaving behind venom pools wherever they walk. Stepping on these will inflict [[venom]] and deal up to 4 damage every [[tick]] if not moving; this stacks up to a maximum of 20 damage per tick if the player does not move. It is advised to target the armoured zombies with ranged, magic, or manually casting crumble undead, as melee will often lead to you walking into their venom. The player is healed and cured of venom when Arrav is defeated and the subsequent cutscene finishes.\n\nUpon defeating Arrav, Zemouregal will order Sharathteerk to teleport Arrav away. However, the spell is blocked courtesy of Elias, who teleports in and asks you to grab the heart promptly. He will then cast a powerful spell that binds both Zemouregal and Sharathteerk in chains. You quickly take Arrav's heart from its pedestal, causing it to glow red, and Elias will teleport you and himself back to the [[Uzer Oasis]].\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nThe Curse of Arrav - Zemouregal arrives.png|The player is discovered right before the heart is recovered.\nThe Curse of Arrav - fighting Arrav.png|Arrav fights the player against their will.\nThe Curse of Arrav - Elias rescue.png|Elias comes to the rescue, casting a powerful binding spell.\n</gallery>\n\nYou will be surprised at Elias' apparent capabilities of directly teleporting into a heavily secured location and binding a Mahjarrat in chains, however briefly. He will remain reluctant to share his history with the Mahjarrat, insisting it is a complicated one, and quickly switches the topic to Arrav's heart; while he has it, it is not enough to break Arrav free from control, and he commits to researching this further. He will lastly note that you will not hear from him for some time, but will contact you when the time comes.\n\n'''Quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Curse of Arrav\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n* {{SCP|Mining|40,000|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n* {{SCP|Thieving|40,000|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n* {{SCP|Agility|40,000|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n* Access to [[Zemouregal's Fort]].\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name \n! class=\"unsortable\" |Unlock details \n! class=\"unsortable\" |Music track\n|-\n|[[The Plundered Tomb]]\n|Unlocked upon entering the [[Uzer Mastaba]]\n|[[File:The Plundered Tomb.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Lamistard's Labyrinth]]\n|Unlocked while in the tunnels beneath [[Zemouregal's Fort]]\n|[[File:Lamistard's Labyrinth.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[The North (music track)|The North]]\n|Unlocked when inside Zemouregal's Fort\n|[[File:The North.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[Heavy Security]]\n|Unlocked during Elias' explanation of the heist plan\n|[[File:Heavy Security.ogg]]\n|-\n|[[The Heist]]\n|Unlocked upon entering the inner section of [[Zemouregal's Base]]\n|[[File:The Heist.ogg]]\n|}\n\n==Developers==\n'''The Curse of Arrav - Original'''\n* '''Developer:''' [[Paul Gower]]\n* '''Graphics:''' James W, Mod Alex, Mod Brass\n* '''Quality Assurance:''' Dan G, Dan O'R, Nicola T, Mod James H\n* '''Audio:''' [[Iain Hetherington]], [[Mod Bond]]\n* '''QuestHelp:''' Katie B\n'''Missing My Mummy - Original'''\n* '''Developer:''' Mod Newmatic\n* '''Graphics:''' Nick F, Matthew S, Jeff K, Mod Alec, Mod GiuG, Wayne M, James W, Chris W\n* '''Quality Assurance:''' Vicki M, Ian 'Chief' H, Andrew E\n* '''Audio:''' [[Mod Grace]]\n* '''QuestHelp:''' Katie B\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 13 November 2024\n|update = Guardians of the Rift Changes Out Now!\n|change = \n* Players can no longer walk into a wall within the [[Uzer Mastaba]].\n* Arrav's ranged defences has been increased from +0 to +80 across the board.\n* Arrav can no longer be shoved with the special attack of the [[dragon spear]] (and variants) as this caused an [[:File:The Curse of Arrav - shoving Arrav.mp4|unintentional bug]] in which doing so would cause all armoured zombies and venom pools to despawn.\n* Venom is now cured when the final cutscene plays.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Historical==\n[[File:The Curse of Arrav wallpaper.jpg|thumb|300px|Concept art for the original quest, originally released as a [[wallpaper]].]]\nThe Curse of Arrav was {{RSL|The Curse of Arrav|originally released in ''RuneScape''}} on [[21 July]] [[2009]], nearly 2 years after the [[August 2007 Archive of RuneScape]] that ''Old School'' was built on.\n\nJagex announced plans to backport the quest during the [[Summer Summit 2024|2024 Summer Summit]], with some adjustments to bring it in line with Old School's standards as well as the overall story narrative of the game.\n\n===Differences from original version===\n* The original version had slightly different quest and skill requirements:\n** {{RSL|Tale of the Muspah}} and {{RSL|Missing My Mummy}} were originally requirements, but do not exist in ''Old School''. Tale of the Muspah was instead adapted into [[Secrets of the North]], with parts of Missing My Mummy being added as parts of The Curse of Arrav. \n** 64 [[Ranged]], 64 [[Strength]], and 66 [[Thieving]] were originally requirements, which were lowered to 62 [[Ranged]], 58 [[Strength]], and 62 [[Thieving]].\n** 41 [[Summoning]] was also a requirement, which does not exist in ''Old School''.\n* The experience rewards were slightly different:\n** 30,000 [[Mining]], 14,000 [[Thieving]], and 9,000 [[Agility]] experience were rewarded, and were increased to 40,000 experience each in ''Old School''.\n** 9,000 [[Ranged]], 9,000 [[Strength]], 2,500 [[Slayer]], and 4,000 {{RSL|Summoning}} experience were originally rewarded.\n** The post-quest versions of [[Armoured zombie (Zemouregal's Fort)|armoured zombies]] and their associated [[broken zombie helmet]] were not present in the original quest.\n** In ''RuneScape'', after completion of Missing My Mummy, a large room of zombie [[small scarab]]s could be accessed from the uninviting hole in the lower level of the Uzer Mastaba, as well as a shortcut on the upper level. While the hole is present in ''Old School'', it cannot be entered.\n* Minor changes were made to the quest's pacing and narrative:\n** The Curse of Arrav was originally started by speaking to Ali the Wise in [[Nardah]], who was first encountered during {{RSL|Tale of the Muspah}}. In Old School, he is replaced by [[Elias White]], who is introduced in [[Defender of Varrock]] instead. Elias White's name is an anagram of Ali the Wise, as well as the [[Mahjarrat]] [[Wahisietel]], who was first mentioned in the original version of The Curse of Arrav.\n** Ali the Wise originally sent players directly to Trollweiss Mountain, with the Uzer Mastaba instead being explored in a previous quest, {{RSL|Missing My Mummy}}.\n*** He also originally directed players to explore the cavern as part of his general research into the Mahjarrat Ritual of Rejuvenation, not mentioning Zemouregal or Arrav. The significance of Arrav's heart was only learned after recovering the [[base plans]] in Zemouregal's Fort. In ''Old School'', taking Arrav's heart is the goal from the beginning of the quest, as its significance is explained in the ''Old School'' version of [[Defender of Varrock]].\n** A major plot point in Missing My Mummy involved the player helping to reconstruct the mummy of Queen Senliten after her mastaba was raided by grave robbers in order to help her remember her identity. As Missing My Mummy is not present in ''Old School'', Queen Senliten is never interacted with, which causes the following to change:\n*** The burial chamber is in pristine condition, instead of it needing to be repaired.\n*** The player finds the canopic jar inside the burial chamber instead of it being given to them by Senliten.\n**** In ''RuneScape'', players received an empty canopic jar from Senliten, and had to place [[sacred oil]] inside it. In 2024, the ''RuneScape'' version of the quest was changed to have Senliten give players a jar with the sacred oil already inside, which ''Old School'' follows.\n*** The player learns how to prepare the canopic jar by reading murals instead of Senliten telling them how to prepare it.\n*** Queen Senliten is never referred to by name, simply being called the Pharaoh Queen in ''Old School''.\n*** Additionally, the floor puzzle inside the Uzer Mastaba could not be disabled, and had to be manually navigated every time.\n** The [[Mahjarrat notes]] originally explained [[Enakhra]]'s rejection of Zemouregal's offer to sire more Mahjarrat as a result of her feelings for [[Zamorak]].\n** Originally, a brief fight with [[Arrav]] occurred inside [[Zemouregal's Fort]], and players had to partially deplete his health before [[Zemouregal]] called him away. In ''Old School'', Arrav is instead fought at the end of the quest, and is significantly stronger and more mechanically involved.\n** Investigating the [[caged killerwatt]] originally revealed a label revealing it was purchased from \"[[Oddenstein]] Labs security systems\". In ''Old School'', the killerwatt's cage cannot be interacted with.\n** The player had to use the {{RSL|remote view}} ability of the {{RSL|Macaw}} or {{RSL|Ravenous locust}} [[summoning]] familiar to wait for an opening between armoured zombie patrols before leaving the sewers of Zemouregal's Base. As Summoning is not present in ''Old School'', Elias White automatically distracts the zombies instead, and they are not visibly present.\n** Originally, the player was able to take Arrav's heart without interference. In ''Old School'', Zemouregal confronts the player and orders Arrav to kill them.\n*** After being stolen, the {{RSL|heart in a canopic jar}} item was obtained. In ''Old School'', this item is never obtained, as it is automatically given directly to Elias White.\n** As he was not present inside the base, Ali the Wise was not shown to possess any magical abilities or be recognised by Zemouregal in the original quest. Ali the Wise also remained in Nardah after completion of the quest, while Elias White disappears.\n** During or after completing the original version of the quest, players could give Ali the Wise the four tablets written by Lamistard, in addition to the Mahjarrat notes. They could also give him information regarding the events of various Mahjarrat-related quests if they had not done so already after completing Missing My Mummy. This does not happen in ''Old School'', as Elias White simply teleports away.\n* Some minor changes were made to the quest's music:\n** In ''RuneScape'', a music track called {{RSL|Kharidian Nights}} was added the outside of Uzer Mastaba a few weeks after the original release of the quest. In ''Old School'', the song is not present. Notably, Kharidian Nights was the first music track composed for ''RuneScape'' by [[Mod Ash]].\n** A music track called {{RSL|Ancestral Wisdom}} originally played on the lower floor of the Uzer Mastaba. In ''Old School'', [[The Plundered Tomb]] plays on both floors.\n** [[Undead Army]] originally played inside [[Zemouregal's Fort]], with [[The North (music track)]] instead being a track called {{RSL|Rest for the Weary}} that played during {{RSL|Tale of the Muspah}}.\n** [[Heavy Security]] was originally an [[unlisted music track]].\n\n==Trivia==\n* The quest itself, as well as parts of {{RSL|Missing My Mummy}}, were speculated to be [[backport]]ed upon release of [[Defender of Varrock]] on [[21 February]] [[2024]]. This is due to a large majority of the assets for both quests having been added to the game alongside the quest, of which the inner section of the base and [[Zemouregal's Fort]] were both inaccessible but viewable in-game via [[oculus orb]], as well as assets for the [[Uzer Mastaba]] (which could be viewed with datamining software).\n* {{RSL|The Tale of the Muspah}}, {{RSL|Missing My Mummy}}, The Curse of Arrav and {{RSL|The Temple at Senntisten}} were originally intended to release as a single quest called Mysteries of the Mahjarrat, which would have been a multi-part special quest in the same vein as [[Recipe for Disaster]]. They were instead released throughout 2009 as a quest series. As a result, Missing My Mummy and The Curse of Arrav being combined into one quest in ''Old School'' brings things closer to the quest's original vision.\n* During the quest, when talking about the defences in the base, the player character mentions that \"It sounds like an impossible mission!\". This is a reference to ''[[wikipedia:Mission:_Impossible_(film_series)|Mission: Impossible]]''.\n\n{{The Curse of Arrav}}"

Make sure you have completed the Making History quest, otherwise when you feel your Enchanted Key it will simply say, \"You already have the journal.\" You will need to find treasure in the same manner as a game of hot and cold by \"feeling\" the key and reacting to its response.\n\nIn three of the sites, there will be the God [[mjolnir]]s, or God spears:\n\n*[[Saradomin mjolnir]] [[File:Saradomin mjolnir.png|Saradomin mjolnir]]\n*[[Guthix mjolnir]] [[File:Guthix mjolnir.png|Guthix mjolnir]]\n*[[Zamorak mjolnir]] [[File:Zamorak mjolnir.png|Zamorak mjolnir]]\n\nThis is the only way to obtain these unique weapons, other than trading with another player.\n\n===Temperature readings===\nThe enchanted key changes temperature as the player moves about. Its temperature is based on the distance of the treasure from the player, measured in the number of steps (including diagonal steps) it would take to reach the treasure, ignoring any obstacles (this is the {{wp|Chebyshev distance}} between the player and treasure). The warmer the key gets, the closer the player is to the treasure. Clicking \"Feel Enchanted key\" gives information on its temperature, consisting of two parts described below. It is like playing the game of hot and cold.\n\n====First part====\nThe following table indicates the 8 possible temperature readings based on the distance to the treasure (measured as described above):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Distance\n!Temperature description\n|-\n|More than 1000 squares\n|'''It's freezing'''\n|-\n|701 to 1000 squares\n|'''It's very cold'''\n|-\n|401 to 700 squares\n|'''It's cold'''\n|-\n|101 to 400 squares\n|'''It's warm'''\n|-\n|61 to 100 squares\n|'''It's hot'''\n|-\n|31 to 60 squares\n|'''It's very hot'''\n|-\n|5 to 30 squares\n|'''Ouch! It's burning hot'''\n|-\n|Up to 4 squares\n|'''The key is steaming'''\n|}\n\nWhen a player receives the message \"'''The key is steaming'''\", they can use a [[spade]] to dig up the treasure. Note that, as indicated by the table, there is a 9 by 9 square region in which they may dig.\n\n====Second part====\nIf the player has already felt the key since last logging on or finding treasure, the temperature reading will contain a second part, indicating whether the temperature is warmer, colder or the same\nas the last reading, thereby indicating whether the distance to the treasure (measured as described above) has increased, decreased, or is the same. The three descriptions are:\n\n*'''Warmer than last time''' - You are getting closer than before.\n*'''Colder than last time''' - You are getting farther away than before.\n*'''Same temperature as last time''' - You are the same distance away.\n\nPlayers may use this information to determine which direction to go, as follows:\n\n#Move one square north, south, east and west, taking temperature readings between each step.\n#One direction, for example north, will result in the message \"'''Warmer than last time'''\".\n#Move directly north while constantly taking readings, until the message \"'''Same temperature as last time'''\" is produced.\n#Move one square east and west, taking temperature readings between each step.\n#One direction, say east, will result in the message \"'''Warmer than last time'''\".\n#At this point the treasure is directly north-east of the player.\n#Move diagonally in this direction while taking readings, until the message \"'''The key is steaming'''\" is produced.\n\n==Treasure locations==\nThere are a total of 11 treasure sites to be found. The first treasure site will always be south of Rellekka. The other ten locations are in a '''random order''' for each player, but the locations will be the same.

He can be found north of the [[Agility]] log north-west of the [[Sinclair Mansion]]. (Fairy ring {{Fairycode|cjr}}) You have to find him as he cannot be seen on the minimap, and he wanders around a lot. His wander range seems to be within a triangle formed by the [[Rellekka]] house portal, the [[Agility shortcut]] to the [[Sinclair Mansion]] and the [[Swaying tree]]. He will not recognise you as the adventurer that killed him earlier, but he also will not trust you to set you on a task. To gain General Khazard's trust, go to the [[Seers' Village]] and talk to [[Sin Seer]]. She can be found upstairs in the house south-west of the [[range|cooking range]]. Bribe her with 40 coins, and she will give you [[Sin Seer's note|a note]] as exchange for your troubles. Return to General Khazard, and talk to him again. He will want you to visit four of his scouts around the world to check up on the status.\n\n===The ghost scouts===\nYou will now need to find the four scouts. One is in Tai Bwo Wannai, another is outside Falador, the third one is in the Kharidian Desert and the last one is outside the Gnome Stronghold. You can find them in any order. Make sure you wear the [[Ring of visibility]] to see them, the [[ghostspeak amulet]] to talk to them, and the [[Ghostly robes]] for them to recognise you as a messenger for General Khazard. It should be noted that the Scouts will not appear as yellow dots on your minimap, so pay careful attention to your screen to avoid passing them.\n\nThe [[Scout (Tai Bwo Wannai)|Karamjan scout]] is near the [[Tai Bwo Wannai]] village. You can use a [[Tai bwo wannai teleport]] or use fairy ring {{fairycode|CKR}} to reach the village fast. Look north-west of the [[Karamja Jungle mine]], which is to the east of Tai Bwo Wannai and north of Shilo Village. His wander range may reach north up to the hardwood grove. Speak to him, he will tell you that the villagers recently left because of some curse caused by their gods, but they came back.\n\nThe [[Scout (Tree Gnome Stronghold)|Gnomish scout]] is to the south of the [[Gnome Stronghold]]. You can either teleport there using a [[Spirit tree]] and run south or by using a [[Necklace of passage]], teleporting to the [[Outpost]] and running north. He could be right by the entrance, but he may be anywhere from near the orchard, circling around the [[Apple orchard]], and up to where the [[Hobgoblin]]s are camped. He will comment on Hazeel, The Plague, the events of Songs of the Elves, and Glough.\n\nThe [[Scout (Falador)|Faladian scout]] is a little east of [[Falador]], between the Falador east wall and the [[Draynor Manor]] west fence. A fast way to reach him is to use the an [[Explorer's ring 2]] or better to [[cabbage port]] and run north. He will also not have anything useful to say, only that Count Draynor has been dispatched by an adventurer, but he will have to go inside to confirm this.\n\nThe [[Scout (Shantay Pass)|Kharidian scout]] is a little south of the [[Shantay Pass]]. Go through the pass or use fairy ring {{fairycode|BIQ}} and run east, and search the area around the rock formation directly south of the pass. ('''Note:''' You may want to bring a [[waterskin]] to survive the desert heat but you won't be spending much time in the desert.) He will inform you that he followed someone called Lazim, and that Khazard may have two more players at the Ritual. He also comments on the prisoner of Jaldraocht having been freed, and that General Khazard used to live in the desert, although not by choice.\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=4|Scout locations\n|-\n|{{Map|name=Scout (Tai Bwo Wannai)|x=2826|y=3066|r=10|mtype=square|caption=[[Scout (Tai Bwo Wannai)|Karamjan scout]] location|width=250|height=250}}\n|{{Map|name=Scout (Tree Gnome Stronghold)|x=2461|y=3374|r=10|mtype=square|caption=[[Scout (Tree Gnome Stronghold)|Gnomish scout]] location|width=250|height=250}}\n|{{Map|name=Scout (Falador)|x=3072|y=3344|r=10|mtype=square|caption=[[Scout (Falador)|Faladian scout]] location|width=250|height=250}}\n|{{Map|name=Scout (Shantay Pass)|x=3304|y=3109|r=7|mtype=square|caption=[[Scout (Shantay Pass)|Kharidian scout]] location|width=250|height=250}}\n|}\n\nWhen you are talking to the last of the four scouts, be sure not to end the conversation until you receive the message that you are to relay back to [[General Khazard]]. The message is \"We of the Blood are still loyal. Pavlov is the messenger.\"\n\n===Bouncer returns!===\n{{Needed|[[Ring of visibility]], [[Severed leg (The General's Shadow)|Severed leg]]}}\n\n'''Note:''' During the fight, you '''cannot '''use prayers of any sort, so be sure to bring some food. You '''do not''' need the ghostly robes, ghostspeak amulet, or ring of visibility for the fight ahead. \n\n'''Warning:''' Leaving any item on the ground when Bouncer dies will move the items to another instance and make them unobtainable. Don't drop anything you're not willing to leave behind. \n[[File:Fighting ghost bouncer.png|right|thumb|The player is ambushed by the ghost of Bouncer.]]\nReturn to General Khazard again, who will be grateful, still not recognise you and give you a [[Severed leg (The General's Shadow)|severed leg]]. He will redirect you to your reward, which is in a cave north of [[Ardougne]].\n\nMake your way to the [[Goblin Cave]], right by the [[Fishing Guild]]. The cave is known from the [[Dwarf Cannon]], [[Land of the Goblins]], and [[One Small Favour]]. Enter the cave, and head north. Take the first passage to the east, and you will arrive at a larger cavern. Do whatever you need to prepare, and enter the \"crack\" in the south wall of the cavern. Once inside, you will see a very short cutscene showing Bouncer and the player will complain about how Khazard DID recognise them and it all was a trap, then the fight will begin.\n[[File:Bouncer safespot in south-east corner.png|alt=A screenshot depicting Bouncer's safespot location.|thumb|A player safespotting Bouncer in the south-east corner of the cave.]]\nNow, you need to defeat the level 160 [[bouncer (ghost)|ghost of Bouncer]]. Use your preferred method to kill it. If you are around a combat level of 100, supplies will most likely be unnecessary. The ghost of Bouncer can hit up to 15, so make sure your hitpoints do not drop too low. You cannot use prayer during the fight. Keep hitting the ghost until its health drops to 10 hitpoints. Then, you will automatically throw the severed leg to distract the ghost. Once it is distracted, you will say \"Away, darn spot!\" and deliver a final blow, killing it. \n\nIf you're well armoured and have a good weapon, it is possible to defeat him without any food or potions, even if you have a relatively low combat level. Lower-level players may choose to lure Bouncer to the South-East corner to safespot. You can also hide in the south-west corner, where the ghost cannot hit you, and use poison to weaken it while hiding. \n\nYou will receive some Slayer experience and a new sword.\n\n==Rewards==\n*The [[Shadow sword]]. This can be reclaimed from the [[Ghost (The General's Shadow)|ghost]] that will appear after Bouncer's defeat for free.\n*{{SCP|Slayer|2,000}} [[Slayer]] experience\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of The General's Shadow is required for the following:\n* [[Secrets of the North]]\n\n===Afterwards===\nSpeaking to the General again after completing the miniquest will result in further dialogue. You will tell General Khazard, \"Your dog attacked me. AGAIN!\" General Khazard simply replies, \"He was angry that you killed him. Quite natural really. Now get out of here you filthy skinbag. I will not waste my time on you.\"\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|miniquest}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n* [[Dogfight]]{{Listen\n|title = [[Dogfight]]\n|desc = The music which plays when battling the ghost of Bouncer.\n|filename = Dogfight.ogg\n}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*When Khazard hands you the severed leg, your player says: \"''Ugh, well, at least it's not another hand.''\" Then the General replies: \"''What, have you dealt with severed limbs before?''\" and the player replies: \"''It's a long story.''\" This is a reference to [[The Hand in the Sand]] quest.\n*The final ghost you inform gives you a message to give to Khazard and adds on the statement: \"''The messenger is Pavlov,''\" probably referring to {{wp|Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov}}'s dogs and Khazard's dog [[Bouncer]].\n*When throwing the severed leg in the final battle, you automatically say \"''Away, darn spot!''\" Besides being a play on the famous dog name \"Spot\", this is a reference to the classic line from Shakespeare's play ''{{wp|Macbeth}}'' wherein Lady Macbeth utters the phrase \"Out, damned spot!\" when she is sleepwalking, and feeling guilty for helping to murder the Scottish king. However, she is referring to an imaginary stain of blood, not cursing a dog.\n*The scouts will make references to quests that players have completed in their area. For example, if the player has completed the [[Vampyre Slayer]] quest then the Falador scout will talk about an adventurer killing [[Count Draynor]] and how he will have to verify whether this is true or not.\n*The scouts are not human, as they repeatedly disparage humans during their conversations with the player. Their actual race is unknown.\n\n{{The General's Shadow}}\n{{Miniquests}}"

Start to tell her about your desire to become regent. She interrupts you to say she has many suitors. She will, however, give you a chance to impress her.\n\nSpeak to the princess a few times, and agree with whatever she says. Once she stops asking new questions, you can use [[flowers]] on her to increase her approval. [[Mixed flowers]] can be bought for 15 [[coins]] from the [[Flower Girl]] in the marketplace just outside the building from where the king presides. Then, use the [[Dance]] [[Emotes|emote]] (or any other jester row emote, or the goblin salute) in her room until she starts asking new questions again.\n\nSpeak to her a few more times, responding with agreeable answers. Once she has nothing left for you to agree with, you can use a [[bow]]<ref>[[Composite bow|Composite]] or [[Magic bow|magic bows]] or the [[Seercull]] will not work.</ref> (the item, not the emote) on her if you've brought one.\n\n'''Note:''' The bow and flowers speed up the process, but neither are necessary to gain her affection. Simply using jester row emotes and answering her questions works too. \n\nAgain, speak to her a few more times. When she calls you \"dear\" and you call her \"darling\", select the [[Blow Kiss]] emote.\n\nOnce she has nothing left for you to agree with, use the ring on her. She will ask \"Is this for me? Really?\". After saying \"Yes\", you will be prompted with \"Would you like to ask Princess Astrid to marry you?\".\n\nSelecting \"Yes\" will result in her finally agreeing to marry you. She says you two will have to put off the actual ceremony until you can find a priest but you can tell her [[King Vargas|father]] of the marriage.\n\nSelecting \"No\" will instead result in her saying she thinks you will make a great Thane for the realm and you can tell her [[King Vargas|father]] that you have earned her trust.\n\n====Prince Brand====\nEnter [[Prince Brand]]'s room, which is south of the throne room, and speak with the Prince of [[Miscellania]]. Start to tell him about your goal of becoming ruler of the kingdom. He interrupts you and asks why he would be interested in a \"crass adventurer like yourself?\" He will, however, give you a chance to impress him.\n\nContinue to talk with the prince, selecting the most flattering answers, until he asks if you would like to hear his poem. Tell him, of course, you would love to. After he recites his poem, select \"Be still, my heart\" and use the [[Clap]] or [[Cheer]] [[Emotes|emote]] (Must be standing inside the room, and not the doorway for both emotes). He thanks you. Use your [[flowers]] on him to continue the dialogue. When he asks if they are for him, say, \"Yes\".\n\nContinue to talk with the prince (he will ask you your name), providing him with flattering answers, until he asks if you would like to hear his saga. You wonder if you have the time to hear a whole saga, but he launches into it anyway. Continue to flatter and talk with the prince, give him the [[cake]] or [[chocolate cake]], and tell him it is for him (be careful not to eat it).\n\nWhen he calls you \"my [darling/dear]\", select the [[Blow Kiss]] emote and use the [[ring]] on him. If he says he could not possibly accept the ring, keep talking to and flattering him. Eventually, after you blow him a kiss and use the ring on him, he says, \"Is this for me? Really?\". After saying \"Yes\", you will be prompted with \"Would you like to ask Prince Brand to marry you?\".\n\nSelecting \"Yes\" will result in you asking the prince to marry you, and he says \"Yes!\" He says that you two love birds will have to put off the actual ceremony until you can find a priest but you can tell his [[King Vargas|father]] he has agreed to marry you.\n\nSelecting \"No\" will instead result in him saying he thinks you will make a great Thane for the realm and you can tell his [[King Vargas|father]] that you have earned his trust.\n\n===Peace deal===\nTalk with [[Advisor Ghrim]], who is off to the side behind the king, and ask him how to make peace with [[Etceteria]]. He tells you to talk with [[Queen Sigrid]] of Etceteria. Head east, cross the bridge over into Etceteria, enter the large building in the east side of town, go upstairs, and enter the centre room, where you will find Queen Sigrid.\n\nSpeak to Queen Sigrid. After you tell her you have been sent by [[King Vargas]] to negotiate a treaty, she says she will agree to a peace deal if King Vargas will accept Etceteria officially as a sovereign nation. Return to Vargas, and tell him what the queen said. He says he will recognise her country if she changes Etceteria's national anthem.\n{{Listen\n|title = Awful anthem\n|desc = The awful anthem's music, which plays when obtaining the lyric sheet from Prince Brand.\n|filename = Awful Anthem.ogg\n}}\n[[File:Queen Sigrid singing.png|thumb|Sigrid singing the current version of the Etceterian anthem.]]\nDash back to Queen Sigrid, and speak with her. Although she, at first, says it is a great anthem and that she composed it herself, she eventually agrees but requests that you come up with a new anthem. Return to [[Miscellania]], enter the room to the south of King Vargas's throne room, and speak to [[Prince Brand]]. You tell him you need a new anthem, and he agrees to write you one immediately. It is, however, terrible. He gives you the [[awful anthem]].\n\nEnter the throne room next door, and talk to Advisor Ghrim about the anthem. You give the advisor the awful anthem, and he makes a few adjustments, turning it into a [[good anthem]]. Return to Queen Sigrid, and tell her you have a new anthem. She is pleased with her new anthem and hands you a [[treaty]] - which she has already signed - to be signed by King Vargas.\n\nTake the treaty back to King Vargas, and tell him it is awaiting his signature. He says he cannot sign it with an ordinary pen. He needs a pen large enough for him to hold. Head to the northern shore of Miscellania, to the east of the mining icon, where you will find [[Derrik]]. He is in the house with the [[anvil]]. Talk to Derrik, and tell him you have a strange request. He says he can make a [[giant nib]] if you have an [[iron bar]].\n\nGive him your iron bar, and he gives you the giant nib. Use the nib on [[logs]], and you end up with a [[giant pen]]. There are a few [[evergreen tree]]s around the islands, so you don't need to go to the mainland if you have not brought logs. Take the giant pen to King Vargas, who then signs the treaty, bringing an end to the rivalry between the two kingdoms.\n\n===Public support===\nAfter the [[treaty]], you must get the support of the people to be the new ruler. You will need the support of 75% of [[Miscellania]] to finish the quest. You will start with 25% (you will start with less if you killed any of the villagers or stole from the stalls) and you gain 0.33% with each action you do. Roughly 152 actions to go from 25% to 75%.\n\nYou can check your approval rating by speaking with Advisor Ghrim. You won't be able to check your progress with the local laborers until you finish the quest - they will ask, \"Who are you?\"\n\nIf you aim to gain 100% approval rating, you can continue working until the person receiving the items stops you. (Your chat box also tells you that you've completed a hard task for your Fremennik achievement diaries.)\n\n====Ways to lose support====\n*Kill villagers. ('''<u>Do not do this before starting unless you want to lose reputation</u>''')\n*Steal from stalls.\n\n====Good ways to get support====\n[[File:Throne of Miscellania - Gaining public support.png|thumb|220px|Gaining support by chopping [[maple tree]]s.]]\n*Buy [[Mixed flowers]] from [[Flower Girl]]. (Fastest method)\n*[[Rake]] the [[herb]]s and [[flax]] outside the palace walls.\n*Mine [[coal]] on the north side of [[Miscellania]].\n*Chop [[maple tree]]s in the centre of Miscellania.  \n*Fish [[tuna]], [[lobster]]s, or [[swordfish]] by the docks of Miscellania ([[Barehand fishing|Barehanded fishing]] works, but does not provide Strength nor Agility experience).\n\nTalk to [[Advisor Ghrim]] to keep track of how much support you have. After you have 75% of the public support, talk to [[King Vargas]] and congratulations! You have completed Throne of Miscellania!\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Throne of Miscellania\n|image = [[File:Throne of Miscellania reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = *[[Managing Miscellania|Management of Miscellania]]\n* 10,000 [[coins]] (inside the Miscellania coffers)\n* The ability to teleport to [[Miscellania]] using a [[ring of wealth]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Throne of Miscellania is required for the following:\n*[[Royal Trouble]]\n*[[Fremennik Hard Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 19 March 2025\n|update = Clan Events Improvements\n|change = Fixed some of Princess Astrid's dialogue during The Throne of Miscellania.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 6 September 2023\n|update = DMM Tweaks, Upcoming Launcher Changes & more!\n|change = Resource collections and coffer deductions that occur while [[managing miscellania]] will now occur at midnight every day, rather than the time players initially completed Throne of Miscellania.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 9 November 2022\n|update = Diversity & Inclusion Changes and Quest Speedrunning Updates\n|change = The player may now choose to romance either Prince Brand or Princess Astrid, regardless of the character's gender.

Ask her about her daughter until you offer to find her. After starting, unequip all of your [[metal]] [[armour]], and put on your [[desert clothing]]. Since you're in the hot part of the desert, your character will grow thirsty and take a drink of [[water]] as time passes. Desert clothing will make your water last longer, and you can refill your [[waterskin]]s by cutting cacti found around the desert with a [[knife]] or a [[slash]] weapon.\n\n{{Map|3232,3032|zoom=1|width=400|height=220|align=right|caption=[[Bedabin Camp]] is directly west of the [[Desert Mining Camp]].}}\nFrom the Shantay Pass, go south to find some footprints. Follow them until you reach some Mercenaries guarding the gate to the [[Desert Mining Camp]]. Search the gate and use the \"watch\" option on the [[Mercenary Captain|mercenary captain]], then talk to him. Compliment him and agree to do him favours until he asks you to kill an infamous bandit leader. Say you can't do it. Then say funny a captain who can't fight on his own.\n\n'''Do not attempt to kill the Captain before this if you are prompted by a text box asking if you are sure.''' Otherwise his guards will swarm you and you will be teleported further into the desert, with the guards taking all your water and dealing significant damage.\n\nKill the captain and take his [[metal key]]. \n\n'''Note''': A [[dwarf multicannon]] can be set up west of the gate and the mercenary captain can be lured to the edge of his roaming area where the cannon will be able to hit him.\n\n'''Note''': The Captain kill is counted even if killed entirely with recoil damage.\n\n===Getting into the mine===\n'''Note: Unequip everything except your desert clothing''' after defeating the captain, and ''before'' entering the camp. Inside the mining camp, wear only your [[desert clothing]] (items are still equipable in your quiver). If you decided to go through the gate with your weapon equipped, you will be put in a cell. Simply bend the bars in the window, and climb out. Once you've climbed out, climb the rocks, then the cliff, and then the rocks once more to escape the camp. You can enter through the gate once more. You may also be sent away from the camp and have your waterskins taken from you. '''{{Colour|Red|Warning}}:''' The waterskins are taken before some unskippable dialogue in which time heat damage can be queued, potentially killing players with low health from the fight after the dialogue finishes.\n\n[[File:The Tourist Trap - Trading clothes.png|thumb|Trading clothing with a slave keen to escape.]]\nOnce inside the camp, go into the building to the north, and search the table with a Bowl of water on it. You will receive a [[Cell door key]], which will save you time if you get caught in the upcoming sections; simply use the key on the [[Prison door (Desert Mining Camp)|prison door]] if this happens.\n\nExit the hut and run to the east wall by the rocks. Talk to the male slave. He will tell you that he's planning on making an escape. Tell him that it sounds interesting. Help him remove his handcuffs and switch his [[Slave robes]] for your [[Desert clothing]] (the [[Black desert robe]] and [[Black desert shirt]] do not work). Do not attempt to do this with a guard close by as you may be detained by the guards here and they will remove the Cell door key from your possession.\n\n:'''{{Colour|Red|Warning}}:''' Once you have entered the underground mine area, '''do not''' remove your clothes around the guards or mention the key, or you will be jailed and forced to mine 15 [[Rock (The Tourist Trap)|rocks]] to be freed, to be handed in all at once. You will lose anything you dropped to make space. Teleporting out is possible. If the dialogue begins where guards have noticed you are not in the right outfit, logging out immediately, then logging back in and equipping the correct outfit will prevent you from being taken. Additionally, the guards may attack you while wearing the slave robes instead of jailing you. Be sure to keep an eye on all guards around you while in the [[Desert Mining Camp]].\n\nWearing the slave robes, enter the mine and follow the path until you come to a guarded cave opening (to save time you can click on the end of the cave directly south on the minimap, to auto-run through the cave). Talk to a guard and tell him you want to mine in a new area, and he will request a [[Tenti pineapple|'Tenti' pineapple]]. Now you can either back track and exit the way you came into the mine through the large double doors and head west to the gate entrance. Unequip ALL pieces of your slave robes and leave the desert camp through the front gate, or return to [[Fairy rings|fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|BIQ}}.\n\n'''Warning:''' You will be jailed if you don't unequip your slave robes before leaving the camp through the front gate or if you exit the mine through the doors with them unequipped.\n\nAlternatively, if you take off your slave clothes whilst still in the mine, you will be quickly taken to the jail, but you will have to kill the mercenary captain again. You can escape jail by bending the cell window, climbing out, climbing the rocks and cliff, and descending outside the camp.\n\n'''Note:''' There is a [[Rowdy slave]] that may attack you while in the mine. You can trap the rowdy slave behind the rocks on the wall in order to talk to the guard.\n\nGo west to the [[Bedabin Camp]] and talk to [[Al Shabim]] in the southern circular tent. He will agree to give you the pineapple if you get some weapon [[Technical plans|plans]] for him, and gives you a key.\n\n===The plans===\nGo back to the Desert Mining Camp. '''Again, ensure that you have no armour or weaponry equipped upon entry.''' Enter the building to the north. Climb up the ladder to where the captain is. Search the [[bookcase (The Tourist Trap)|south-west bookcase]] to learn he has an interest in sailing. Talk to the captain, following the choices below.\n*Start with \"I wanted to have a chat?\" He will insist that you leave. Next say \"You seem to have a lot of books!\" He will reply and agree that he does. Now say \"So you're interested in sailing?\" and he will perk up and say that it's been a passion of his for most of his life. Finally, reply \"I could tell by the cut of your jib.\" Saying this will flatter him and he'll begin rambling off about sailing stories and will be distracted enough for you to unlock his Chest and steal the blueprints.\n\n[[File:The Tourist Trap - Making the prototype dart.png|thumb|220px|Making the prototype dart tip for Al Shabim.]]\nThis will get him distracted enough for you to search the chest. After you have the plans, go back to the [[Bedabin Camp]] and show [[Al Shabim]]. He'll give you permission to use the [[anvil]] nearby. Enter the tent directly north of Al Shabim, near the magic carpets and use your [[bronze bar]] on the anvil to create a [[Prototype dart tip]]. Then add the [[feather]]s to make a [[Prototype dart]]. It is possible to fail both steps so make sure you have brought additional materials.  Take the dart and the technical plans back to Al Shabim and he will give you the [[Tenti pineapple|pineapple]] you need.\n:'''Note:''' You can now make your own darts!\n\n===Finding Ana===\n[[File:Tourist Trap - Riding the mine cart.png|thumb|220px|Riding the mine cart. Enjoy the ride!]]\nEquip your Slave outfit and head back down into the mine and give the [[tenti pineapple]] to the guard who wanted it. He'll now let you inside. Walk further down into the mine until you find yourself in front of a mine cart. Before going in the mine cart, search (not 'look in') the barrels nearby until you can pick one up one as you'll need one later. Then, get into the cart by searching it, and ride it to the other side.\n:'''Note:''' It is possible to fail this stunt and take 1-4 damage by banging your knee or falling off the edge of the minecart.\n\nGo down the north-west path, to find [[Ana]]. Simply use the barrel on her and head back toward the mine cart; making sure not to drop her.\n\n'''Note:''' If you engage in conversation with Ana the guards are listening so do not mention anything about the guards or having a key as you will be thrown in the mine to mine ore and your key will be taken from you.\n\n===Rescuing Ana===\n[[File:The Tourist Trap - Ana in a barrel in a mine cart.png|thumb|220px|Putting Ana on the cart.]]\nPut the [[Ana in a barrel]] into the mine cart and send it down the track before getting in and riding down to the other side after her. Search an empty barrel and you'll automatically find and retrieve the one that has [[Ana]] in it ('look-in' doesn't work).\n\n'''{{Colour|Red|Warning}}:''' If you attempt to exit the mine with [[Ana in a barrel|Ana]] still in your inventory then the guards will discover her, jail you and you will need to start the '''Rescuing Ana''' section again.\n\nWalk to the [[winch bucket]], put the barrel on it. The guard nearby will offer to help you hoist it up. Accept the help. The guard will hear Ana talk, so you'll want to select the complementary dialogue option to throw him off. (Note: This part of the quest is known to glitch; if you are unable to get Ana on the winch without alerting the guards log out and retry it)\n\nHead back to the surface again and go to the [[winch (The Tourist Trap)|winch]] in the south-west corner ('''Do not''' take off your slave robes as you will be thrown in the underground cell and forced to mine 15 rocks). Operate it before searching the nearby barrel to retrieve Ana. Then, put her in the wooden [[wooden cart (The Tourist Trap)|cart]] nearby. Now, you need to talk to the [[mine cart driver]].\n[[File:The Tourist Trap - Operating the crane.png|thumb|220px|Operating the crane with Ana in the barrel.]]\n:\n\nIn order to get out, tell the cart driver the following phrases. \n{{Colour|Red|Warning}}: If you click the wrong dialogue options you will have to redo the majority of this quest! \n*2. ''\"Nice cart.\"''\n*2. ''\"One wagon wheel says to the other, 'I'll see you around'.\"''\n*1. ''\"One good turn deserves another.\"''\n*3. ''\"Fired... no, shot perhaps!\"''\n*3. ''\"In for a penny in for a pound.\"''\n*3. ''\"Well, you see, it's like this...\"''\n*1. ''\"Prison riot in ten minutes, get your cart out of here!\"'' (You could also choose to bribe the driver instead for 100 coins)\n*2. ''\"You can't leave me here, I'll get killed!\"''\n\nSearch the cart and choose the option to get on it.\n\nHead back to [[Irena]], and she'll reward you for all your hard work.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Tourist Trap\n|image = [[File:The Tourist Trap reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*4,650 [[Experience]] in your choice of two skills (you may pick same skill twice): {{SCP|Agility}} [[Agility]], {{SCP|Fletching}} [[Fletching]], {{SCP|Smithing}} [[Smithing]], or {{SCP|Thieving}} [[Thieving]].\n*The ability to smith [[dart tip]]s.\n*The [[wrought iron key]] - allows access to a special door inside the [[Desert Mining Camp]], which has several higher tier ores inside, including [[mithril ore]] and [[adamantite ore]].\n*Full [[slave robes]]\n*6 [[bronze dart]]s\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of The Tourist Trap is required for the following:\n*[[Desert Treasure I]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 30 April 2015\n|update = Mutagens, Mo & Much More\n|change = Fixed a typo in some Tourist Trap dialogue.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n{{The Tourist Trap}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT|Tourist Trap, The}}"

Here are the questions and answers:\n\n:#''How many nails does it take to make a rocking chair?'' - '''Three.'''\n:#''What takes 3 planks, 3 cloths and 3 nails to make, and helps remove light from a room?'' - '''Torn curtains.'''\n:#''I like fish and I want to put some in my garden, but I need a special water feature. What materials would I require?'' - '''10 clay pieces.'''\n\n{{Map|2656,3212|mtype=pin|align=right|caption=Location of [[Builder's trousers|Trousers]].}}\n\n*Talk to [['Gummy']] and ask for trousers. He says he lost a pair around the tower - just search the [[plant (Tower of Life)|plants]] south-east of the tower to find the [[Builder's trousers]].\n*Talk to [['The Guns']], who wants a [[beer]]. Go and buy a beer for 2 [[coins]] at [[Flying Horse Inn|The Flying Horse]] pub in north-west East Ardougne or the pub at the [[Fight Arena (location)|Fight Arena]] or [[Yanille]] and return, give him the beer, and he will give you his [[Builder's shirt|shirt]].\n*Finally, talk to [['No fingers']] and [[Thieving#Pickpocketing|pickpocket]] him when he refuses to give you the [[Builder's boots|boots]].\n*Once you've acquired all the items, you must answer some questions from Bonafido for him to grant you entry to the tower. The answers are:\n\n:#''You've plenty of work to do, but you need a drink fast - what do you go for?'' - '''Tea.'''\n:#''Now, let's hear you whistle!'' - '''Whistle for attention.'''\n:#''What's a good sign that you need to replace your trousers?'' - '''Your legs are getting a bit cold.'''\n:#''What do you do if you cut your finger?'' - '''Carry on, it'll fix itself.'''\n\nAfter answering these questions, you are allowed to enter the tower. Please note that you need to wear the outfit if you want to enter the tower at any time during the quest, although it is not needed after.\n\n===Fixing up the tower===\n[[File:Tower of Life Repair Supplies Location.png|right|thumb|400px|Repair Supplies Location]]\n*All the required items are on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} in crates. Search these as required. Each crate gives the same item; search again to get more or if you get nothing the first time.\n*A pressure machine, a pipe system, and a strange cage at the top need to be finished. A [[hammer]] and a [[saw]] (or [[crystal saw]]) are needed to fix these machines.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Item\n! Machine\n!

As soon as you put a pipe in the correct location, it will lock in place.

If it disappears, redo the steps with the next size up.\n\nIt is helpful to remember each \"square\" of the cage is composed of 2-length pipes.

All multiple-choice answers are either magical, logical or neither. You need to push the bar at the top of the screen either to fully magical or fully logical; once done, the Homunculus will be okay. It does not matter if you push the Homunculus's mind towards magic or logic - the outcome will be the same.\n\nThere are 14 questions. Choosing a magical answer moves the arrow to the left, a logical answer moves the arrow to the right, and a neither answer does not move the arrow. If you don't move the arrow all the way to one end, then the questions repeat. Likewise, you could finish before all the questions are asked.\n[[File:Homunculus Magic or Logic.png|thumb|220px|Helping Homunculus with magic or logic]]\n\n*''How can I make fire appear at my fingertips?''\n**'''Logic''' - Get some logs and a tinderbox.\n**'''Magic''' - With the aid of 5 fire runes.\n**'''Neither''' - That's impossible!

The original versions of these tracks were in the game for only two weeks (19 February-6 March 2007) before they were replaced.\n*When you are talking to [['The Guns']] about his [[beer]], you misspell \"beer\" as \"bear\".\n*If the player has completed the [[Making History]] quest before they have begun Tower of Life, then a short, yet humorous, verbal exchange occurs between [[Effigy]] and the player.\n*[[Bonafido]] states - \"Hahaha, don't be a plonka!\" which is a variation of the term ''[[Wiktionary:plonker|plonker]]''. This is a British and Australian derogatory slang for a very stupid person, made popular in the British TV sitcom \"{{Wp|Only Fools and Horses}}\" (1981-1996, 2001-2003) in which the main character Derek \"Del Boy\" Trotter often referred to his daft brother Rodney as \"a right plonker\".\n*The {{Wp|Homunculus}} of {{Wp|alchemy}} were created by combining parts of different animals to create a {{Wp|hybrid}}.\n*Upon examining some floating vials, the player receives the message \"Oh, oh, oh, it's magic!\", a reference to the song {{Wp|Magic (Pilot song)|Magic}} by {{Wp|Pilot (band)|Pilot}}.\n*The player makes several references to begging during this quest, such as when talking with [['Gummy']], the player says \"Ah, come on. You know you want to '''give me free stuff'''.\", and when talking to 'Currency' the Alchemist, the player says \"Hi Currency. '''Got any spare cash?'''\"\n*After the long [[cutscene]] with the [[Homunculus]] brought to life and after talking with Effigy, the player quotes their own mother saying ''experience teaches fools'', which is an old Latin phrase - ''experientia docet stultos''.\n*Examining the barricade on the top floor of the tower gives the message \"Thou shalt not pass!\", a reference to a famous line spoken by Gandalf in {{Wp|The Lord of the Rings}}.\n*After the quest, the room north of Homunculus in the basement has an interactive light floor which turns blue when you walk on it. This may be a reference to the disco dance floor in {{Wp|Saturday Night Fever}} or the music video {{Wp|Billie Jean}}.\n*In the 3rd [[Chaos Elemental]] letter ([[Transcript:Property Law and Vampyres.|15th]] [[Postbag from the Hedge]]), the elemental hints at this quest by stating: \"In the basement of the tower of life you'll find the homunculus; he's crossing a lobster with a jubbly! A spider with a sardine! A newt with a rooster!\"\n*The [[satchel]]s, a post-quest reward, were created by [[Jagex]] to test out a new kind of scripting, where what is being stored is in the players' database instead of the main game.\n\n{{Tower of Life}}"

He will say that three orbs have been stolen by Khazard troops. Agree to help him, and you will be escorted by Elkoy out of the maze.\n\n===The three trackers===\n{{Needed|6 normal logs.}}\n\nNorth to the [[Gnome maze|maze]] you will find a [[battlefield]]. Find [[Commander Montai]] and speak with him, he is wearing red clothing. He will ask for you to get 6 [[logs]] to repair their defences. Supply him with the logs (if you didn't have logs or an axe simply return to a bank, or alternatively, you can kill the [[goblin]]s in the maze for one. However, this will likely take longer than going to the bank). Talk to [[Commander Montai]] again, and he'll tell you that three trackers that have been sent out to retrieve coordinates to fire the [[ballista (Tree Gnome Village)|ballista]] have not returned. He asks you to find them.\n[[File:Tree Gnome Village - Tracker gnome locations.png|thumb|220px|Tracker locations.]]You can find all three tracker gnomes at the buildings north to the [[battlefield]]. (look at the picture to the right to see the locations)\n*The first tracker is behind or on the side of the biggest building in the north-west.\n*The second tracker is in the north-east building in a Khazard Prison Cell.\n*The third tracker is roaming outside the south-west corner of the stronghold.\n\nThe first two trackers will give you the coordinates you need, which you'll automatically commit to memory. The third tracker, however, has been driven mad as a result of the chaos. Though most of what he says is garbage, he will give you a hint as to the number you need. You may have to do a bit of guesswork, though. For instance, ''\"Less than my hands\"'' would equal 1, where ''\"More than my head less than my fingers\"'' could be 2, ''\"More than we but less than our feet\"'' is 3, and lastly, ''\"My legs and your legs\"'' is 4. (It should not be any other possible number so try and remember what the third tracker said.)\n\nHead back to the [[Ballista (Tree Gnome Village)|ballista]] (not the [[Catapult (Battlefield)|catapult]], which is next to Montai), which is located in the south-west corner of the battlefield, here you want to choose the coordinate given from the third gnome tracker. If you miss, just try again until you get it.\n\n===The orbs===\n[[File:Tree Gnome Village - Crumbled wall.png|thumb|220px|left|The crumbled wall you can climb over.]]\nOnce you get a hit, talk to [[Commander Montai]] once again then walk north to the stronghold (building where Gnome Tracker 1 was) and climb over the crumbled wall. \n\n'''Note:''' There is a stall after climbing the crumbled wall where you are attacked without being able to heal; as a low-levelled player, this may be dangerous.\n\nOnce you climb the wall you will be attacked by a level 48 [[Khazard commander]]; they have low [[Hitpoints]] (22) and should not be troublesome for most mid-levelled players (can be [[safespot]]ted behind northern broken chair). You can skip defeating the commander if you wish and proceed to the western room and climb up the ladder.\n\nWhen you climb the [[ladder]] you will once again be attacked by a level 48 [[Khazard commander]], kill him or head to the chest and  find the [[orb of protection]]. When you have the orb, run back down the ladder and out of the nearby door.\n\nGo the north-west maze entrance and talk to [[Elkoy]], he will offer to lead you through the maze, accept his offer. push through the fence and talk to  [[King Bolren]].\n\n[[King Bolren|The King]] will then tell you that the other two [[orbs of protection]] have been stolen by the [[Khazard warlord|Khazard Warlord]].\n:'''Note:''' If you fight the warlord before talking to the King again, you will have to fight him again as the orbs won't drop the first time.\n\n{{Map|name=Khazard warlord|2455,3301|r=4|mtype=square|caption=The location of the Khazard warlord.|align=right|width=250|height=250}}\n'''Items needed:''' Weapons, armour and decent food.\n\n'''Tip:''' Consider if you want to fight [[Khazard warlord|the warlord]] using ranged or head on.\n\nExit the village and start heading north past the stronghold where you found the first orb. When you hit the wall to [[West Ardougne]], you want to go left and follow the wall until see two [[Khazard trooper|Khazard troopers]] and the level 112  [[Khazard warlord]]. Talk with him and he will challenge you to a fight and attack. Kill him to retrieve the other two orbs. Although he has a rather large health pool of 170 HP, he does not hit often if you are wearing decent armour. Players with [[Rune armour]] and at least a [[rune scimitar]] should have little trouble fighting him if they have a small amount of decent quality [[food]] ([[lobster]] or better). Magic or ranged can also be used easily by continuing to move outside the range he can walk to, or by setting up a safespot.\n\n[[File:Tree Gnome Village - Warlord safespot.png|thumb|left|x250px|A player safespotting the Khazard warlord.]]\n\nThe warlord is also prone to [[flinch]]ing. By attacking him and walking west outside of his wander radius, he will stop attacking you once you have reached far enough west. If you use a Ranged or Magic attack here, the warlord will start running back east. If you run towards him and start attacking him again inside his wander radius, he will come back to you. Run west again before he is able to reach you, and repeat the process. '''Do not take too long killing the warlord, or he will despawn and you will be forced to restart the fight. He does not despawn when flinching around a tree.'''\n\n'''Safespot ranged:''' To safespot the warlord, start the fight and head west until the warlord de-aggros near the larger dead tree. Move a little south and attack the warlord with Ranged or Magic while outside his aggro range. This will force the warlord to walk backwards at an angle and get caught against the West Ardougne wall and the northern large dead tree. If done correctly, players can attack the warlord safely as long as they keep distant enough as to not aggro the warlord again.\n\n'''Safespot melee:''' Melee players can also safespot him by repeatedly stepping in and out of his walking range. One good spot is beside the large skull to the south.\n\nAfter killing him, pick up the [[orbs of protection]]. Go back to King Bolren and hand over the orbs to him. A cutscene ensues, where the gnomes are seen celebrating and holding a ceremony in which the orbs are returned to their places on the sacred spirit tree.\n\n[[File:Tree Gnome Village - Orbs restored.gif|thumb|180px|King Bolren returns the orbs to the spirit tree.]]\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Tree Gnome Village\n|image = [[File:Tree Gnome Village reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Attack|11,450}} [[Attack]] [[experience]]\n*Use of [[spirit tree]]s for transportation\n*The [[Gnome amulet]]\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Khazard warlord]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Tree Gnome Village is required for the following:\n*[[Monkey Madness I]]\n*[[The Path of Glouphrie]]\n*[[Medium Western Provinces Diary]]\n*[[Medium Varrock Diary]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n{{Tree Gnome Village}}"

Consider using the ship from [[Ardougne]] to Brimhaven (30 [[coins]] each way). Kangai wants help to recover a tribal totem that was stolen from the [[Rantuki Tribe]] by [[Lord Handelmort]]. Say ''\"I'm in search of adventure!\"'' and then ''\"Ok, I will get it back\"'' to start the quest.\n\n* Teleport or charter the Ship at the docks to Ardougne. Handelmort lives in the mansion (not the castle) west of the main square in Ardougne. Go to the house and find the door securely locked.\n* Talk to Horacio, the gardener, and ask him who he is. Ask him if he gardens around the back as well. You and Horacio will talk briefly about the security around the house. He will tell you that the combination to the door lock is Handelmort's middle name.\n\nThe only way to the totem is by using a new teleporting invention from [[Wizard Cromperty]]. Cromperty is in the house north-east of the [[Ardougne market]]. Ask him about his new invention. The new invention will teleport players next to a teleport block, which looks very similar to a crate. Ask Cromperty to teleport you, in order to find the location of this teleport block. This happens to be in the Ardougne [[Gielinor Parcel Delivery Team|GPDT depot]]. After the teleport, the teleport block is located in a crate to the east of the teleport location.\n[[File:Tribal Totem - GPDT.png|thumb|220px|right|G.P.D.T.]]\n\nInvestigate the [[crate (Tribal Totem)#Double|north-eastern crate]] to find an [[address label]], addressed to Lord Handelmort. Use this label on the [[crate (Tribal Totem)#Single|eastern crate]] intended for the Chamber of Invention of the [[Wizards' Tower]] to cause the teleport block to be delivered to Lord Handelmort's house instead.\n\nTalk to a [[GPDT employee]], and ask when the block will be delivered. Obviously, that happens very quickly after talking to them. Return to Cromperty.\n\nTalk to Cromperty and ask to use his new teleport spell again. '''(Do not use the right-click 'Teleport' option,''' or you will be sent to the [[Rune essence mine]]!''')''' Now, the teleport is to the new location of the block in Lord Handelmort's house.\n\nInside the house, go west through two doors. The second door is locked; the password is '''K U R T'''. (Horacio, the gardener, will mention that it is Lord Handelmort's middle name. This can be found in the guide book from the real estate agent's house). Enter the code using the left and right arrows (K=10 right, U=6 left, R=9 left, T=7 left). When the password is set, click enter to unlock the door. '''''If the password K U R T does not work and it states \"This combination is incorrect.\" try entering the letters very slowly and only clicking the right arrow, as the game may not register the letters if clicking too quickly'''''.\n\nEnter the door and '''investigate''' the [[stairs (Tribal Totem)|stairs]]. '''''Do not'' use the \"climb-up\" option first! '''If you try to climb-up the stairs instead of investigating it first, a trap will activate when using the stairs.

To get to the stronghold in this manner, use the [[Trollheim Teleport]] '''or''' walk to the western entrance in the mountains. From the teleport location ('''1''' on the map), go to the south-west path. Walk past some [[troll]]s, and take a ramp on the north-western side of that area ('''5''' on the map). After entering the stronghold, use the stairs at the northern side of the corridor. Once down, take the southern corridor. At the end of the corridor, go through the door leading west. Ug is in the southern part of the room.\n\nIf using slayer rings ('''2''' on the map), or the fairy ring ('''3''' on the map) walk from the teleport location north-east to the shortcut ('''4''' on the map; requires [[climbing boots]] to use) and enter the stronghold. Follow the corridor north and use the stairs in the north-eastern corner. Once up the stairs travel south down the corridor, go through the door leading west. Ug is in the southern portion of the west room. \n\n'''Talk to [[Ug]]''' to learn that he is very much in love with [[Aga]], who, unfortunately, loves [[Arrg]], a much stronger troll than is Ug. Offer your help; Ug will gladly accept it, promising he maybe won't eat you. \n\n'''You should talk to [[Aga]]''', who is in the room north of Ug, accompanied by the fearsome Arrg.\n\nIf you want, compliment Aga about her being big and hairy, then enquire about her love life. She is a very romantic troll: whilst Arrg is big and strong, she does not know whether he loves her. He promised to bring her a rare and beautiful [[Trollweiss]] flower, but has not done so yet. She has never heard of Ug. \n\n'''Talk to an angry [[Arrg]]''' to discover that he does not seem to be very much in love with Aga ('she good cook and wash but talk too many') and has many girlfriends. He also has no knowledge of the Trollweiss location, only promising Aga the flower to shut her up. \n\n'''Go talk to [[Ug]] again''' to tell him Aga's desire for a Trollweiss flower. He concludes he stands no chance, for no such flower has been found for years, nor will you be able to find one. He says that one who has lived their whole life in the mountains would know where to find [[Trollweiss]], giving you an idea.\n\n===Mystery of the flower===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Maple logs|maple]] or [[yew logs]], [[iron bar]], [[rope]], [[cake tin]], [[swamp tar]], [[bucket of wax]].''\n[[File:Troll Romance Tenzing.png|thumb|Tenzing describes the location of the flower.]]\n\nA person that is knowledgeable about the mountains is [[Tenzing]] the sherpa. He lives on the path from [[Burthorpe]] to the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|stronghold]] ('''7''' on the map). Use the [[games necklace]] or [[grouping]] interface to teleport to Burthorpe. From the teleport location, go west and then north-west up the path. At the [[Soldier (Death Plateau)|wounded soldier]], go south-west on the winding mountain path to Tenzing's hut ('''7''' on the map).\n\n[[Tenzing]] explains that [[Trollweiss]] used to grow everywhere but has been disappearing lately. It definitely remains in the [[ice troll]] area, but that is very dangerous and impossible to reach. You would have to reach a certain plateau at the bottom of a slope that has been snowed over. He mentions that a [[sled]] may be useful for getting to that plateau, although you would not be able to get back up. [[Dunstan]] knows more about making a sled, as he has often helped Tenzing with his boots.\n\n[[Dunstan]] is the [[Burthorpe]] smith, whose house is north-east of the [[Burthorpe Castle]] ('''8''' on the map). Talk to him and ask for a sled. He says you are too old to be playing in the snow, but you explain that you need to reach a particular location on [[Trollweiss Mountain]]. He will agree to help you as you have often helped his family. After some thinking, he requests that you bring him the following materials: [[Maple logs|maple]] or [[yew logs]], an [[iron bar]] and a coil of [[rope]]. If you want, ask him about [[Godric|his son]], who has been training with the Imperial Guard and promoted to the rank of sergeant.\n\nBring him the materials. Dunstan fashions you a sled but it still has to be waxed in order to smoothen and protect the wood. He says you can mix some [[swamp tar]] with wax in a [[cake tin]] to achieve the desired effect. You can get tar from the [[Lumbridge Swamp]] and suggests the wax is found near [[bees]]. Get some swamp tar and a [[bucket of wax]]. The latter can be obtained from the [[beehives]] south of [[Camelot]]. (An empty bucket spawns nearby.) You require [[insect repellent]], found in the house north of [[Catherby]] bank, in order to do so.\n\nWith an empty [[cake tin]] in your inventory, use the [[swamp tar]] on the [[bucket of wax]] to get [[wax]] (in the cake tin). Note that it has to be done in that order. Use the wax on the sled to make a waxed sled, making it possible to ride it. The next task is to go up [[Trollweiss Mountain]], past the ice trolls' realm.\n\n===Fetching the flowers===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Sled]] (waxed).''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' Food, energy potions, prayer potions.''\n\nReturn to [[Trollheim]] using the [[Trollheim Teleport]] spell, via [[Fairy rings]] (code {{Fairycode|ajr}}), the [[Slayer Ring]], or make the long walk. Exit the Trollheim maze on the north-western side and take the narrow path leading north, then west, then north again to a dungeon entrance just past the ice gates and the [[troll child]].\n\nThe dungeon entrance does not show up on the minimap and can be hard to find; it faces east and is labelled '''9''' on the map. Do '''not''' enter the ice gate east of the child.\n\nIt will be snowing around the area of the cave. '''Do not spend too much time standing in the snowing area as all your stats will slowly decrease by 1.'''\n\nEnter this cave and walk through it to the north-western corner. Beware of the [[Ice troll|ice trolls]] which have a strong [[melee]] attack. In the north-western corner is the exit (marked red on the minimap): a narrow crevasse. It's hard to see. It's the little alcove just before the very end. There are no trolls near the crevasse inside the cave, so you can wait here to rest as needed.\n\n[[File:Trollweiss mountain.png|thumb|An undisturbed patch of rare Trollweiss flowers.]]\n\nWhen outside, walk south past the [[Ice wolf|ice wolves]] to an opening in the rocks at which point you can walk no longer. Click the slope once to ride the sled due south to crash into a rock just east of the flower patch. You'll see the circular area with a red dot and a central rock; unequip the sled and walk in. (Be careful not to sled down the second slope further south, or else you will have to climb the entire mountain again.) \n\n'''If you teleport away while using the sled and you have full inventory, you will lose it and have to get a new one!'''\n\nPick the [[rare flowers]]. Teleport out to prepare for the final battle, or if you brought combat items, you can return to [[Ug]] by riding the sled down the rest of the mountain, going through the tunnel coming out on Rellekka's side and running back to the shortcut ('''4''' on the map). This requires [[climbing boots]].\n\n===Facing Arrg's wrath===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Trollweiss]], equipment and supplies for fighting Arrg.''\n\n'''Note:''' The fight with Arrg is not a safe death for [[Ironman Mode#Hardcore|Hardcore Ironmen]].\n\nReturn to [[Ug]] and give him the Trollweiss. (You are not able to talk to him if you have the flower in your hand.) Ug will be very glad to receive the flowers, but he is afraid of [[Arrg]], so he cannot give [[Aga]] the Trollweiss directly. The only option is to battle Arrg.\n\n[[File:Fighting Arrg.png|thumb|Duelling Arrg to the death!]]\n\nGo to the room north of [[Ug]] where [[Arrg]] is still around. Prepare for battle before talking to him. [[Protect from Melee]] is very useful, but he also uses Ranged indiscriminately and can occasionally hit through protection prayers. Like most trolls, Arrg has very high strength for his combat level and he has a max hit of 38 in both styles.\n\nTalk to Arrg and defend Aga's honour. You will challenge him to a duel, but not in front of the lady. The two of you are transported into the [[Troll arena]] ('''10''' on the map).\n\n===Fighting Arrg===\nArrg attacks immediately after the teleport, so be prepared. '''Note: You will automatically retaliate.''' Arrg has a strong [[melee]] attack and can hit through [[protection prayers]]. He can also throw rocks, so make sure to keep food on hand. He is level 113 and does not have very high defence or hitpoints.\n\n[[File:Troll Romance - Arrg safespot.png|thumb|left|250px|The safespot for fighting Arrg.]]\n\nThere are multiple safespots for Arrg. He can be safespotted at the west gate of the arena. However, unlike [[Dad]], Arrg is small enough to fit between the mountain walls and attack you. Therefore, Arrg must be lured to the raised land at the north-west of the arena. To lure him, turn on Protect from Melee, run to about the centre of the raised land, and wait for Arrg to catch up. Once he is on the raised land, run to the gate and he should get stuck on the mountain wall. The second safespot is at the northern end of the Arena, lure Arrg to the gate and then simply run onto the raised ground to the west and he will get stuck on the end. A third option is to trap him behind any of the spectators standing on the elevations as he will get stuck behind them. Now Arrg cannot attack you at all and you can safely kill him with magic or ranged. Arrg disappears after a few minutes and he will reappear at the spot where Ug is, so even if you safespot him, you need to kill him quickly. (Note: if you die while in combat with Arrg, you can return to the troll arena to fight him again. He will follow the player around, but will not attack the player first. This makes it easy to get into a safe-spot to try again.).\n\n[[File:Second Arrg safespot.png|thumb|Second safespot for Arrg.]]\n\nDefeat Arrg; he will dramatically shout his name and fall to the ground. Victorious, return to Ug. Head west out of the arena until you reach the secret entrance ('''4''' on the map). Otherwise, return via Trollheim. (Arrg will have lost his macho attitude and cringe before you.)\n\nTell Ug about the demise of Arrg. Since you are very strong and nice, he gives you some 'pretty rocks' in thanks. Rather unfortunately, he is still too scared to talk to Aga, upon which you call him useless and compare him to your toothless grandmother. This will convince him to finally win over the lady troll. She will eat the flower and become his girlfriend, making him weep tears of joy.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!!'''{{clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Troll Romance|image=[[File:Troll Romance reward scroll.png|centre]]|qp=2|rewards=*{{SCP|Agility|8,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*{{SCP|Strength|4,000}} [[Strength]] experience\n*1 [[uncut diamond]], 2 [[uncut ruby|uncut rubies]] and 4 [[uncut emerald]]s \n*A [[sled]] (required to complete a hard and two elite [[clue scroll]] steps)\n*Sledding route from [[Trollweiss Mountain]]\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Arrg]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Troll Romance is required for the following:\n*[[The Curse of Arrav]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* When threatened Arrg says \"This concept of love confuses and infuriates us!\".

Tell him that you will help him out and find [[Godric]]. After talking to Denulth, follow the path north-west, then going south-west when you reach the [[injured soldier]], and reach Tenzing's house. Tenzing sells [[climbing boots]] for 12 [[coins]] each if you don't have them. Climb over the stile behind the house to begin the journey up the mountain. Follow the path until you see some rocks to the north. Put your boots on and climb over them. Then, go east and enter the arena. You will have to climb rocks twice more before reaching the arena.\n\n===Dad===\nA huge troll called [[Dad]] will prevent passage until you defeat him. At level 101 and using a tree to hit with [[Melee]], he can hit up to 27 and send players flying, temporarily [[Stun (status)|stunning]] them. Dad can be [[safespotted]] by standing next to the western gate, or standing where the audience is, and attacking with either [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] (using a [[halberd]] is a good Melee alternative). Note that Dad has high [[Defence]] stats against Ranged and Magic, so it may take a little bit before you kill him. It is much easier to damage Dad using magic, compared to range. \n\nWhen Dad is low on health, he will ask you to spare his life. Spare him and walk past to the gate north of the arena. Be careful as he may try to hit you still if you are in range. '''Note:''' If you don't spare his life, you can still continue the quest.\n\nEnter the cave north of the arena, and go past the level 69 and 71 [[mountain troll]]s. Beyond this is [[Trollheim]]. There are level 68 [[thrower troll]]s who will range players here as they walk past the northern part of the mountain. You can avoid them entirely by taking a shortcut by climbing up the rocks, starting from the eastern region of the mountain and ending at the western side. Some of the shortcuts require 41, 43, 44, or 47 [[Agility]]. If you do not have at least 44 Agility, run around the mountain and activate [[Protect from Missiles]] around the northern bend to avoid taking too much damage from the trolls to get to the western portion. (Avoid the north-west portion going towards the [[God Wars Dungeon]].)\n\nGo west of Trollheim and north past several mountain trolls. Enter inside the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Stronghold]].\n\n===Inside the stronghold===\n[[File:Troll general safespot.png|thumb|220px|Safespot for the Troll General.]]\nInside are some more level 69 and 71 [[mountain troll]]s. From the entrance, walk south until you see a door on the west wall. Enter and walk north, passing the non-aggressive troll, [[Kob]]. You will see several '''aggressive''' [[troll generals]] (level 113). They wield huge granite knives and mauls, which can hit up to 38. Kill one to get a [[prison key (Troll Stronghold)|prison key]]. Use [[Protect from Melee]] or [[safespot]] them with [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. The southern-most general can be safespotted easily by standing on either side of the desk in his room, or by standing next to the ladder and luring him out into the corridor. Like [[Dad]], it may take a while if killing with Ranged or Magic as they have a high [[Defence]] against both.\n\n===Prison break===\n[[File:Berry and Twig safespots.png|thumb|220px|Safespots for Berry and Twig.]]\nOnce you have the key, go back south, down the stairs arriving in [[Burntmeat]]'s Kitchen, and then go to the very north end of the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Stronghold]]. Enter the locked door with the prison key, and climb down again to reach a jail. Head west and south, and you'll see two sleeping prison guards called [[Berry]] and [[Twig]]. Both are level 71. If you have level 30 [[Thieving]], pickpocket both to get [[Cell key 1]] and [[Cell key 2]]. Beware, if you fail to pickpocket one, they will still attack you! If not, kill them for the keys.

You will be instructed to visit the temple in the city, as [[Prince Itzla]] is expecting you. The temple is found just south-east of the [[bazaar]], marked on the world map with two [[File:Dungeon map link icon.png]] dungeon icons.\n\nAt the temple, you will find [[Metzli, Teokan of Ranul]], who will tell you that you saved the life of her counterpart, [[Servius]]. Tell her you're meant to be meeting the prince, and Metzli will tell you he is talking to Servius in the crypt under the temple. Take the stairs down to proceed.\n\nAfter entering the crypt, head north through the gate and speak to the prince in the centre of the open area. He will re-introduce you to [[Servius, Teokan of Ralos]], revealing him to be his father, and will remind you that someone is plotting to kill Servius. He will then explain that, given the strict policies on travelling outside the kingdom before the signing of the treaty in Varrock, the culprit can only be a member of the delegation that visited. Prince Itzla therefore suspects that one of the [[Knight of Varlamore (Children of the Sun)|Knights of Varlamore]] who travelled with Servius is responsible, and suggests speaking with the Tullus twins once more.\n\n===Oh Brother!===\n[[File:Varlamore crest detail.png|left|73px]]\nReturn to the Tullus twins at the [[Sunrise Palace]], who are now found further inside the palace grounds. They will mention six knights and give you their locations, as well as a [[Varlamore crest]] to prove you are helping them. You must now find and collect the [[Knight of Varlamore (Children of the Sun)|knights]], who will all be known as \"Knight(s) of Varlamore\". They do not have to be returned to the palace in any particular order. \n\n====Arrun and Claudia====\n[[File:Twilight's Promise - pickpocking stolen amulet.png|thumb|220px|The correct citizen to steal the stolen amulet from.]]\nArrun and Claudia can be found in the centre of the [[bazaar]]. They will agree to return to the palace after finishing their work of catching a thief, for whom they planted an amulet at one of the stalls, hoping it would be stolen. They will encourage you to rummage through the pockets of bazaar-goers until you find the thief that took the bait.\n\nPickpocket the [[Citizen (Twilight's Promise)|citizen]] in the second-to-lightest shade of blue robes (he will be the only one with robes of that colour) to find the [[stolen amulet]]. Return it to the knights, and at which point they will agree to return to the palace.\n\n====Nel====\n[[File:Twilight's Promise - weapons crate.png|thumb|220px|The crate full of weapons.]]\nNel can be found in the Southwestern part of the [[Fortis Cothon]], on the docks. To help her return to the palace quicker, she will ask for assistance in finding a [[Crate (Twilight's Promise)|crate]] full of weapons. Complete the dialogue until Nel mentions where to find the crate, and then head to the north-east corner of the cothon.\n\nThe crate you will need to search is directly adjacent to two barrels with fish in them, close to a bench. Search the crate to learn the name of the smuggling ship, the Fortis Spark, and return to Nel. Inform her of your findings and she will agree to return to the palace.\n\n====Mezan====\n{{Needed|Combat equipment for two different styles, or a poisoned weapon (there is a bank in the Colosseum that requires [[Glory]] to use).}}\nUpon entering the [[Fortis Colosseum|Colosseum]], head north to the training area and talk to Mezan. He will mention that his training partner has not shown up, and will only leave if you spar with him in the partner's place. The fight will require any two combat styles, as he will start praying against the one currently being used every four attacks. Note that due to a bug, it is not possible to autocast magic on him with a staff, although manually casting does work. If no attack style is used 4 times in a row (for instance, attack 3 times with melee then once with range and repeat) then he will never use protection prayers. It is also possible to use a [[poisoned]] weapon to finish Mezan off, as this can be reapplied through his prayers. Once the fight is over, Mezan will leave for the palace. If the player dies at the same time as the knight then the knight will still return to the castle when spoken to.\n\nNote: The Voidwaker special attack counts as a non-melee based attack.\n\nNote: [[skillers]] and other limited account builds can use [[poison dynamite]] to poison Mezan and run in circles until he dies. Players can also use dynamite for true damage dealt on him, and then recoil him down to 0. Mezan's max hit is 8, meaning that players doing this method should be prepared with a substantial amount of food as well as [[Saradomin brews]].\n\n====Velam and Azali====\n[[File:Twilight's Promise - Velam sobering up.png|thumb|250px|The player instructs Azali to dunk her head in the fountain in order to sober up.]]\nVelam and Azali can be found at [[Atlazora's Rest]], just north of the [[Outer Fortis General Store]]. Azali will need to sober up, so lead her to the fountain east of the bar to trigger a short [[cutscene]]. Once in a while, Azali will stop following you; simply talk to her again and then head towards the fountain once more. Return to the bar and speak to Velam, and then head to the palace after finishing the conversation. If you have a pet or follower active, Azali will not follow you.\n\n====Judgement====\n[[File:Twilight's Promise - Velam is killed.png|thumb|250px|Ennius kills Velam, who pleaded his innocence until the very end.]]\nOnce all knights have returned to the palace, speak to the twins again to learn that the knights stayed in the [[Kualti Headquarters]] prior to visiting Varrock, just west of the palace. The Headquarters is the large building containing a statue of [[Queen Zyanyi Arkan]], situated across the road from a small building with training dummies. Head there and go up both flights of stairs to reach their bedrooms.\n\nInvestigate one of the [[Chest (Twilight's Promise)|chest]]s in the south-eastern room to find an [[incriminating letter]] (the letter has an equal chance of being in either chest), and then read it and return to the twins once more. Speaking to the twins will trigger a cutscene in which Velam, claiming innocence, will be killed by Ennius. The twins will now tell you to deliver the news to the prince at [[the Teomat]]. '''Note:''' reading the letter is '''required''' to start the cutscene.\n\n===The Twilight Emissaries===\nSpeak to [[Regulus Cento]] outside the palace next to the quetzals and ask about getting to the Teomat. Regulus will tell you that Prince Itzla has given you a personal [[quetzal]] to fly around Varlamore, and gives you some [[Quetzal feed (Twilight's Promise)|quetzal feed]] for [[Renu]], who is newly trained and ready. Feed Renu the quetzal feed, and an interface for the [[Quetzal Transport System]] will open. Travel to [[the Teomat]] (it will be a small option on the menu, found just north of the [[Cam Torum]] location). Note that from here on out, you can access the already-unlocked quetzal locations at any time; you do not need to finish the quest.\n\nHead inside the Teomat and speak to Prince Itzla in the room with the altar icon, and let him know about Velam's betrayal. He will be surprised, and when you tell him that you believe that Velam's murder is too convenient and that Ennius had killed him too quickly, he will agree to keep an eye on the twins. He will then share to you about the [[Twilight Emissaries]], a religious cult obsessed with the end of the world - the Final Dawn.\n\nTo learn about the Final Dawn, head slightly north to the library and speak with [[Metzli]]. She will mention [[Ximoua]], a belief passed down from the [[Old Ones]], and say that the Final Dawn being an interpretation of it; the difference in belief however is not that the end of the world ''will'' come, but rather that it must be ''made''. As you're finishing up the conversation, you will be attacked by eight level 34 [[cultist]]s, whom you must defeat. Note that only one will attack you; the rest will only attack after being attacked first. If necessary, you may let the guards finish them off.\n\nOnce you defeat all eight cultists, a cutscene will play showing that Servius has been gravely wounded, even though none of the cultists made it inside. Notably, [[Metzli]] has disappeared, but Servius is quickly brought back to the capital. Prince Itzla will then tell you that he will contact you again once he has planned the next steps.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nTwilight's Promise - killing cultists.png|Cultists storm the Teomat.\nTwilight's Promise - Servius is injured.png|Servius is gravely injured during the attack.\n</gallery>\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Twilight's Promise\n|image=[[File:Twilight's Promise reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1 \n|rewards =\n* Ability to use the [[Civitas illa Fortis Teleport]] spell\n* Ability to use the [[Quetzal Transport System]]\n* {{SCP|Thieving|3,000|link=yes}} experience \n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nThe completion of Twilight's Promise is a requirement to complete the following:\n* [[Perilous Moons]]\n* [[The Heart of Darkness]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n{{Twilight's Promise}}"

Since all these items start adding up quickly, the guide will tell you when a certain item is no longer needed anywhere in the quest and is therefore safe to drop. However, if you die, you will need to acquire these items again to get back to where you were.\n:'''Note:''' Ensure that you do not have a [[piece of railing]] in your bank. If you do, remove it from your bank before proceeding through the dungeon.\n\nThis quest relies heavily on your [[Agility]] skill, often making you complete a number of obstacles in succession. In most cases, failing any of the obstacles in an area will send you back to the beginning of the area, which can be quite frustrating, especially if your Agility is low. Many of the obstacles are harder to traverse if the player has a high equipment load. As the risk of all enemies besides the final encounter may be mitigated via safe-spotting or Protect from Melee, players should strike a balance between equipping [[Weight-reducing clothing]] and protective armour.\n\nMany of the traps in the dungeon damage you based on your '''current''' health. This means that by keeping your health relatively low, you will have to use less [[food]] through the dungeon than you would if you were to eat to full [[Hitpoints]] each time you get damaged.\n\n===The Pass to the Tyrant===\n[[File:Underground Pass start.png|thumb|Speaking to Lathas in his throne room.]]\nTo begin, talk to [[King Lathas]] on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} floor of [[Ardougne Castle]]. He'll remind you about the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] and that it is the only way to reach the western lands in order to stop his corrupted brother [[King Tyras]]. Unfortunately, the evil [[Iban]], who claims to be the son of [[Zamorak]], and his cultists have moved in. He'll ask you to check in with his head tracker [[Koftik]] who is waiting for you just outside the entrance to the Underground Pass. Your mission is to find a way to the other side of the dangerous pass and report back.\n\nThis time, you'll be allowed to go right through the front gates to [[West Ardougne]], so head through and walk all the way west through the city until you find the cave entrance with [[Koftik]] standing outside. Talk to him, and he'll explain more about the Pass. It is unlike other caves, being possessed of a corrupting darkness that breaks the will of men. He tells of the proud adventurer [[Randas]], who apparently heard the voice of Zamorak himself inside the cave, telling him how to achieve his greatest goals. Nobody has heard of him since. Koftik instructs you to meet him next to the bridge further inside.\n\n===Getting in and across the bridge===\n{{Needed|A [[bow]], [[arrows]], [[spade]], and [[rope]]. Bring the rest of your supplies now, '''including the spade''' as after this section there is no turning back unless you want to restart the entire dungeon.}}\n\nWhen you walk inside '''(#1)''', you'll see three paths branching off in different directions. ('''{{Colour|red|Warning}}: Do not take the middle path'''; the swamp will drag you down and send you tumbling down a hillside forcing you to crawl back up.) Instead, take the northern most path. Climb over a series of rocks around the swamp and get to where [[Koftik]] is standing next to a fire '''(#2)'''. There is a [[Stone tablet (Underground Pass)|stone tablet]] near the beginning. It contains an eerie text that you may read if you wish. Several more tablets will be encountered later on, written to celebrate Iban and his supposed heritage.\n\nTalk to him, and he'll tell you it looks like there have been others in the cave already. If you want, Koftik also shows you an excerpt of the diary of Randas that he found lying around. He'll give you an [[oily cloth]] from the remains of a camp and tell you he found charred arrows as well. If you later need another one, you can search the nearby pile of abandoned equipment to get more. Use the oily cloth on an arrow, and then use the result on the fire to get a [[fire arrow]]. You can stack several of these before lighting them in case you miss. If you get the message \"I can't reach that!\", then move closer to the gate or adjust your position along it.\n\n[[File:Underground Pass - Firing guide rope.png|thumb|230px|Shooting the guide rope with a fire arrow.]]\nGo north to get to the small area '''(#3)'''. Look across the subterranean river, and you can see where the guide rope holds up the bridge. Fire your lit arrow at the rope. If you succeed, the bridge will drop, and you'll automatically walk across the bridge.\n\n'''Do not''' pull the lever right after the bridge (it will send you back to the beginning).\n\n'''Before you continue, take the [[plank]] north of the lever (#4).'''\n[[File:Underground Pass - First area map.png|center|500px]]\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n#Cave entrance from [[West Ardougne]]\n#[[Koftik]]\n#Fire your [[Fire arrows|lit arrow]] here!\n#[[Plank]] spawn by [[blessed spider]]s\n#Use a [[rope]] on the overhang to cross the pit.\n#Grid\n#[[Furnace]]\n#Wall traps\n#Well to the second area\n{{Col-2}}\n:B - [[Giant bat]]s\n:G - [[Goblin]]s\n:O - [[Ogre]]s\n:S - [[Blessed spider]]s\n:Z - [[Zombie]]s\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===The pit===\n{{Needed|[[Food]] (strongly recommended) and 1 or more [[rope]].}}\nWalk south from where you picked up the plank. Do not walk into the swampy area filled with [[blessed spider]]s and instead head back east '''(#5)'''. You will come up on a pit and a small water crossing with a rope swing. Use your [[rope]] on the rock hanging from the ceiling above the dark pit to [[Rope swing (Underground Pass, north)|swing across]].\n\n[[File:Underground Pass - Crossing the pit.png|thumb|230px|A player successfully swings across the pit.]]\n'''''If you fail and fall''', you will fall into a rocky pit and lose your rope. Follow the path on your mini-map climbing over rocks when needed to get to the muddy rock pile. You'll be placed at the very beginning of [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]]. You will need another rope to attempt the obstacle again. You can purchase ropes at the general store in Ardougne.''\n\n===The grid===\n[[File:Underground Pass - Grid.png|thumb|220px|The grid]]\nContinue down the path going east and then south. Eventually, you'll see [[Koftik]] standing in front of a grid '''(#6)'''. He is being affected by the voices you have been hearing in your chat, talking about the paths of righteous men and their being beset by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyrannies of the evil. He says you have to pick your own path next.\n\nMany of the tiles will drop you into a pit '''''dealing 15 damage to your health'''''. You'll need to use trial and error finding a safe path across. Once you've found a safe way across, remember it; you'll need it for [[Regicide]]. Pull the lever once you are across to lift the gate. The path is different for everyone. Not all grid paths are possible, you will never need to:\n\n* Walk backwards (to the east)\n* Walk diagonally to another cell\n* Walk north or south more than two cells on the same column\n* Walk north or south on the middle column (just walk straight west across it) \n\nThe grid puzzle '''always''' does 15 damage upon falling into a pit. Keep this in mind while trying new squares. Should you die from falling, your items will stay in the pit. To retrieve what you lost then, you must intentionally step on a square that will drop you into the pit. Once you get across the grid, there is an altar in the next important room, so you can use [[Rapid Heal]] to save some food.\n\n'''Remember or write down the path you used to get across. You have to come back through here *twice* during [[Regicide]] later; the correct path is permanent and unique to each player. (Your browser will remember the path saved in the grid below as long as you don't clear your browser cache).'''\n\nIt can be useful to keep track of the route you have to take using the following grid:\n\n{| class=\"underpasstable\"\n|{{#vardefineecho:table|<table class=\"lighttable\"><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></table>}}\n|{{#var:table}}\n|{{#var:table}}\n|{{#var:table}}\n|{{#var:table}}\n|}\n\nWhen crossed, pull the lever on south to open the gate.\n\n===The orbs and the well===\n{{Needed|A [[plank]] (optional but suggested).}}\n\nTo the north there is a [[furnace]] '''(#7)'''. For the moment it can be ignored, but remember where it is. If you forgot to pick up the plank by the Blessed Spiders earlier there is another one that spawns just north-east of this furnace.\n\n'''{{Colour|red|Warning:}}''' If you use the obstacle pipe, it will cause you to go back to the rope swing with no return.\n\nHead west, to a narrow corridor '''(#8)'''. Approach it carefully, as there are five traps (odd markings) in the wall. (There's two on the north side followed by three on the south side.) There are two ways of passing the traps.\n\n#The traps can be disarmed normally, with a chance to fail and be hit for 5 to 14 damage.\n#Run through the traps one at a time, which hits a percentage of your current health, as low as 3. So keeping at above 10&nbsp;hp should be safe.\n:'''Note:''' Some guides suggest simply running through the trap by starting at the adjacent tile. This no longer works.\n[[File:Well of Iban.png|thumb|The Well of Iban and its surroundings.]]\nWhichever method you choose, you will eventually arrive to an area with an [[altar]] '''(#9)''' (note: this is a good opportunity to activate the [[Rapid Heal]] prayer and leave it on until the orbs of light have been destroyed This will save on food which may be required later on) and a large, rather sinister-looking well in the centre. At this point you will be unable to climb down the well as a magical force prevents you from doing so whilst there is still light. Read the [[old journal]] lying by the well; it was written by Randas and describes how he had orbs of light blessed by Saradomin to keep the darkness at bay. You must destroy these [[orb of light|orbs]] to proceed. To complete this profane task, there are four different paths branching off from this room:\n\n:'''Note:''' Clicking on the well no longer deals damage if the orbs of light haven't been dealt with. Instead, it gives the clue that the orbs should be destroyed before one can descend deeper into the pass.\n:#Start with the very north passage. Use the [[plank]] you picked up earlier on the flat rock to disarm the three traps. Go past the traps and pick up the orb of light at the end of the tunnel.\n:#The next one (the next one to the left, north-west) is fairly easy as well. Run through the level 39 [[spider]]s and level 53 [[ogre]]s to grab the orb and run back again. You can activate [[Protect from Melee]] to minimize hitpoint loss.\n:#Go through the middle path next. Navigate the traps the same way as you did for the northern path.\n:#Traverse through the tunnel (south-west path). However, when you get to where the orb is, '''don't''' pick it up. Disarm the trap underneath it, and then grab the orb.\n:'''Note:''' Disarming can be failed, triggering a swinging log, dealing 6 to 13 damage.\n\nNow that you have all four of the orbs, back track a little bit. Go back to where the furnace was '''(#7)''' (remembering to be careful of the traps in the wall). Use each of the orbs on the furnace to destroy them.\n\nMake sure to top off your prayer if needed and head down the well '''(#9)''' descending another level. If you need food, search the [[Crate (Underground Pass)|crates]] to the west to receive two [[salmon]] and two [[meat pie]]s.\n\n===The cages and the obstacle maze===\n{{Needed|[[Spade]] and [[food]].}}\n[[File:Underground Pass - Second area map.png|centre|250px]]\n\n#Entrance from the first area via climbing down the well\n#Dig by the mud patch with your [[spade]].\n#Narrow ledge\n#[[Agility]] maze\n#50 [[Thieving]] shortcut to bypass the maze\n#To the third area\n\n[[File:Underground Pass prison.png|thumb|The cells with slaves.|200px]]\nThere is some food in the crates right when you arrive down the well '''(#1)'''.\n\nHead west through the cave, and you'll find yourself in an area with a few cages containing [[Slave (Underground Pass)|slaves]] guarded by [[goblin]]s. You may enter the cells by picking their locks to talk to the slaves if you want ; their dialogue varies from pure gibberish to a friendly offer to cook you into soup. Pick the lock on the first one on the left (south-east). You'll notice that there's a rather odd-looking patch of ground at the back of it. Use your [[spade]] on this to dig through, and you'll find a hidden tunnel that will take you through to the other side '''(#2)'''. Do not drop your spade in case you fail the narrow ledge.\n\nEdge across the narrow ledge '''(#3)''', and you'll be near a maze of raised beams '''(#4)'''. However, '''you can skip this step with 50 [[Thieving]] as seen in the next paragraph'''. To get through it, you'll need to hop over a number of obstacles. If you fail, you need to climb back up one of the ramps nearby, often setting you back a few steps.\n[[File:Underground Pass maze.png|thumb|The rat-infested maze of ledges and spikes.|220px]]\nTo get through the maze:\n\n*Take the first right.\n*Then left.\n*Then another left.\n\nIf you have 50 Thieving, go a little bit further south past the maze to a [[Gate (Underground Pass Shortcut)|gate]] that you can pick the lock of '''(#5)'''. It completely bypasses the whole maze. Once through, head south to meet Koftik. He has clearly been corrupted by the voices to the point of insanity, although he claims the contrary himself. Squeeze through the pipe entrance to get into the next area '''(#6)'''.\n\n:'''Note:''' You can now drop your bow and arrows (if not relying on ranging for combat), spade, ropes, and any oily cloth you picked up earlier. They are no longer needed for the quest.\n\n===The caged unicorn===\n{{Needed|None.}}\n[[File:Underground Pass - Third area map.png|center|300px]]\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n#Entrance from the second area\n#[[Unicorn]]\n#[[Sir Carl]], [[Sir Harry]], and [[Sir Jerro]]\n#Well\n#To the fourth area (Iban's Lair)\n{{Col-2}}\n:S - [[Skeleton]]s\n:Z - [[Zombie]]s\n{{Col-end}}\nIn the next room, you'll find a group of [[skeleton]]s and a [[unicorn]] in a cage '''(#2)'''.\n[[File:Underground Pass - The unicorn.png|thumb|230px|The boulder that players must push down with the piece of railing.]]\nYou'll need its horn, but you can't get into the cage to get it. If you search the cage, you'll find a loose [[piece of railing]]. '''Note: If you already have a piece of railing in your bank, you're unable to obtain a new one.''' Take this, and head (south) up the path above where the cage is you'll find a large boulder. ('''Before moving the boulder, make sure that you have no items on the ground. As after the boulder is moved they will be gone!''') Use the loose railing to pry it loose, and crush the unicorn. Now, you can go back down and retrieve the [[Unicorn horn (Underground Pass)|unicorn horn]] by searching the [[smashed cage]]. Proceed through the tunnel entrance and head north.\n\n:'''Note:''' You can now drop your piece of railing. It is no longer needed for the quest.\n\n===The paladins===\n{{Needed|[[Food]], [[combat]] [[equipment]] and the [[Unicorn horn (Underground Pass)|unicorn horn]]. A [[plank]] is suggested, but not required.}}\n[[File:Doors of Iban.png|thumb|The imposing doors of Iban and the Iban's staff recharge well.]]\nHeading north through the cave, you'll come to a small group of [[Paladin]]s named [[Sir Carl]], [[Sir Jerro]], and [[Sir Harry]], who have made a sort of camp '''(#3)''', having been tasked by Lathas with the same mission but unable to open the locked Doors of Iban. Upon speaking with any of them, they will offer you some nourishment in the form of two loaves of [[bread]], two [[meat pie]]s, a bowl of [[stew]], a [[Prayer potion|prayer potion (2)]] and an [[Attack potion|attack potion (2)]]. Afterwards, they suggest that you leave and let them finish the task.\n\nUnluckily for the paladins, you need the [[paladin's badge]]s that they carry and the only way to get them is to slaughter them. They're all level 62 and attack with melee. It is possible to [[safespot]] the paladins by attacking them and running west where they will not follow you.\n\nHead west keeping your eyes out for the traps there. Again, you can foil them by placing the [[plank]] on them. Keep going west to where there's another well '''(#4)'''. Its inscription says that the doors of Iban will not open as long as there is a beating, good heart present and the well demands the offering of such a creature's remains and three crests of the blessed. Use the [[Unicorn horn (Underground Pass)|unicorn horn]] and the three badges on the well to open the large doors '''(#5)''' conform its inscription.\nOnce you have all three badges (red, blue, and green), deposit them into the well along with the horn. The doors of Iban will open.\n\n:'''Note:''' You can now drop your plank. It is no longer needed for the quest.\n:'''Note:''' Remember the well if you want to use the [[Iban's staff]] later. This is where you recharge it after use.\n\n===The dwarves===\n{{Needed|None.}}\n[[File:Underground Pass - Fourth area map.png|thumb|left|Iban's Lair]]\n''Now, you're in the largest area of the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] (and indeed all of [[RuneScape]]) and one of the most frustrating. Around all edges of the area is a rock ledge to walk on. The middle is a large, open area with a maze of walkways, most of which are broken. If you try to jump across them, sometimes, you will fall and end up taking big damage when you hit the ground below, as well as being in a large area filled with [[Soulless]]. Keep in mind that this area has been known to take well over an hour to clear, so be persistent.''\n\nThe doors lead to a massive cave and [[Koftik]] will appear again, declaring the place his home and Iban to be his friend. He mentions some 'foolish [[dwarves]]' that have taken up residence to the south and resist Iban. He tells you to slay them in his lord's name like you did the paladins.\n\nFor now, ignore the walkways, though do take note of the locations where you can get onto them. Walk down along the east wall and then west until you find a cave into which you can descend. Descend down into the cave. ''(Map of bottom level is found in next section.)''\n\n[[File:Underground Pass - Fifth area map.png|thumb|This is the level beneath Iban's Lair.|333x333px]]\nThere are three dwarves named [[Niloof]], [[Klank]], and [[Kamen]] in a small fenced area with two buildings just to the west. Niloof will be surprised to see a human and explain their group consists of miners unaware of the evil of Iban. The son of Zamorak has corrupted the only exit into the western lands, the [[Well of Voyage]], instead using it to dispose of his victims. You suggest to kill Iban, to which Niloof replies to seek out Iban's only confidante and guide, [[Kardia]], the witch who lives on the platforms above. He then gives you two more pies and a pizza.\n\nKlank explains the dwarves are the only ones not corrupted by Iban's voice. All humans have become [[soulless]] slaves of his, or possibly of Zamorak's himself. Those who resist are locked in cages until they are broken. He gives you a pair of [[Klank's gauntlets|sturdy gauntlets (called Klank's gauntlets)]] to protect against the soulless' vicious bite.\n\nFinally, Kamen is a little fried and asks you if you want some of his brew which 'will blow your head off' and advises to keep it away from naked flames. If you '''decline''', he will offer to sell you some [[bread]], [[stew]] and a [[meat pie]] for 75 coins; if you '''accept''', your [[Agility]] level will temporarily decrease by 4; he will then still offer the food for 75 coins.\n\nThere's a tinderbox spawn in the smaller eastern building, if you didn't bring one.\n\n===The ritual of Iban===\nGo back through the cave staircase used to enter the area, south-east of the dwarves. Go north-east until you reach the first walkway that can be used. Walk along it, jump the gap, and take the first turn south to find Kardia's house (the witch).\n\n[[File:Kardia's house.png|thumb|220px|The witch ranting about the dwarves.]]\nAttempt to open the door, or search the window, and you'll hear her talking to herself about her missing [[Witch's cat|cat]]. Head north, take the western path, hop across the gap and then take the north branch of the path. Follow it until you find the cat. It will be a yellow dot on your minimap. Grab it and go back to the witch's house again (if you drop the cat, you'll have to wait for a moment before you can grab it back).\n\nKnock on the door. You'll automatically hide behind the corner while the witch gets her cat. While she's distracted, open the door and sneak into her house to search the chest. You'll get a [[stat restore potion]], a [[super attack potion]], the [[history of iban]] and a [[doll of iban]].\n\n'''Note: This paragraph is just context.''' Although not absolutely necessary for progressing the quest, reading the book will reveal some background on [[Kardia]]'s revival of the insatiably ambitious [[Black Knight]] Iban after he had been slain by the [[White Knights]] in their [[Dawn Ascent]] operation. She vowed to resurrect him as undead so that he could fulfil his ambitions to create an army of soulless zombies. She explains how she brought his body to a tomb in the caverns beneath the Pass and smeared some of his flesh onto a doll bearing his likeness. She then claimed some of the blood of [[Kalrag]], a giant spider who had oft feasted on humans, and smeared some onto the doll as well. To recreate Iban's shadow, she performed an ancient and dark ritual known as Incantia: she summoned three demons, now bound as the keepers of Iban's shadow. Finally, to give Iban conscience, she took an innocent white dove and strangled it. She gave the corpse to a servant and locked him in a cage on the northern platforms. She finishes by noting that the same ritual would also undo Iban and destroy him. You now need to collect four elements of Iban to imbue the doll.\n\n:''You may drop the book to save inventory space, since it is not required for completion of this quest and only serves an informative purpose.''\n\n===== Collecting the four elements of Iban to imbue the doll =====\n\n====1. Iban's body====\n{{Needed|A [[bucket]] and a [[tinderbox]].}}\n[[File:Underground Pass - Burning Iban's tomb.png|thumb|220px|Iban's tomb set ablaze.]]\nEither fall or head back south to the cave to get back downstairs. Iban's tomb is in the south-eastern corner but cannot be opened. ''If you try to do so, a yellow claw will hit you for 10 damage.'' A nearby stone tablet says that only by burning the tomb will the corpse become available.\n{{cquote2|Only as flesh becomes ash,<br>\nand wood becomes dust,<br>\n...will Iban's corpse embrace<br>\nnature's eternal lust.}}\n\nEnter the larger building in the dwarven camp and pick up the bucket in the corner. Also speak to Niloof about the doll and the witch; he will confirm that you need to reverse Kardia's ritual and then throw the doll into the Well of the Damned. Next, go into the smaller building and pick up the tinderbox. Use the bucket on the barrel inside of the smaller house to get some of the [[dwarf brew]] that [[Kamen]] was offering you earlier.\n\nTake this and head back to Iban's tomb. Dump the bucket of alcohol on top of the tomb (only needs to be done once) and light it up with your tinderbox either by using it on the tomb or via the search option. After you're done watching it burn, a pile of [[Iban's ashes]] will appear in your inventory (or drop on the ground). The ashes will automatically be used on the [[Doll of iban|doll]] (unless the doll had been dropped, in which case you must do it manually).\n\n:'''Note:''' You can now drop your bucket and tinderbox. They are no longer needed for the quest.\n\n====2. Iban's blood====\n{{Needed|[[Food]], [[combat]] [[equipment]], and the [[doll of Iban]].}}\n[[File:Underground Pass - Fighting Kalrag.png|thumb|230px|A player uses a skeleton as a safespot to attack Kalrag.]]\n\nHead straight north from the tomb, and keep going until you reach a corridor full of [[blessed spider]]s (these have a max hit of 4). Run to the end of the corridor until you find a giant level 89 spider named [[Kalrag]]. Kalrag can hit somewhat hard (a max hit of 9), but is fairly inaccurate if you are wearing melee armour. The biggest challenge of this fight is often the swarm of spiders which can keep you from attacking Kalrag. If you're below 79 combat, it can be fairly difficult to finally get her alone to begin attacking, which is why it's advisable to run to the back of the corridor and start attacking her before the others get to you. Kalrag can be safespotted by luring her to the far north of the room, then running to the spot between the two skeletons (shown to the right).\n\nWhen you defeat her, you'll automatically soak up the blood with your [[Doll of iban|doll]]. '''The spiders nearby will attack you and can pile up on you despite not being a [[multi-combat area]]. They will interrupt the fight with Kalrag if they are attacking you. Once you kill Kalrag, you will be [[Stun (status)|stunned]] for about two seconds (and can be attacked by all spiders at once) so heal up before dealing the finishing blow. Using Protect from Melee is advisable.''' While stunned, you will automatically smear Iban's blood onto the doll.\n\nLow levels might have a problem with Kalrag as the blessed spiders will keep attacking, preventing the player from attacking her. This can be avoided by running alongside Kalrag, killing blessed spiders in the hope that Kalrag will be the next to [[aggro]] on you. You can also try trapping Kalrag in the north-western corner of the cave, to make sure she's next to you after you kill a spider. Kalrag can be killed without it hitting you if you aggro it with a ranged attack and run past the stalagmites on the west side of the corridor, as its movement range ends a tile before those stalagmites it will back up until you have to move forward to keep attacking. Repeat until dead.\n\n\nKalrag can be safespotted with range/magic on the very northern wall. 1 tile east of the skeleton.\n\nOnce you have killed Kalrag, exit the corridor.\n\n====3. Iban's shadow====\n{{Needed|[[Combat]] [[equipment]] and the [[doll of Iban]].}}\n[[File:Underground Pass - Fighting Othanian.png|thumb|230px|A player uses a stone bridge to safely attack Othainian.]]\n\nTo get [[Iban's shadow]], you need to kill three level 91 [[demons]] named [[Doomion]], [[Othainian]], and [[Holthion]]. Head north and then west from the witch's house, and take the first left (south) all the way down until you reach where the demons are.\n\nKill each one any way you like and pick up the [[amulet of doomion]], [[amulet of othanian]] [sic], and [[amulet of holthion]] that they drop respectively. If you are a low level or are using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]], there are [[safespot]]s for killing the demons by standing on the narrow pathways. You can also kill Othainian & Holthion from the walkway on the edge of the map. \n\n'''Note:''' After obtaining the demon's respective amulet, that same demon will no longer be aggressive towards you nor is it attackable. However, using manual magic cast still allows you to attack the demon without it being able to reciprocate—possibly an oversight from Jagex.\n\nThe last demon, [[Othainian]], may be difficult to safespot; lure him to the southern edge of the island, then run back to the narrow pathway and he will be stuck on the corner or safespot the demon from Doomion's isle. If using a halberd, you can safespot Othainian by staying on the narrow pathway segment that you land on after jumping over the narrow pathway. If you did not bring telegrab runes, it is strongly recommended to cross the bridge to his island before killing him, so that you do not have to kill him again if you fail the obstacle.\n\nOnce you have all three of them, head just north of where Doomion was to the chest. Opening it will remove the amulets from your inventory and give you Iban's shadow. It will automatically be used on the [[Doll of iban|doll]].\n\n'''Note:''' After using Iban's shadow on the doll, the demons are no longer aggressive nor are they attackable (unless using manual magic cast, which they won't retaliate to).\n\n====4. Iban's dove====\n{{Needed|[[Klank's gauntlets]] and the [[doll of Iban]].}}\n:''Make sure you put on [[Klank's gauntlets]] to avoid taking damage from the [[half-soulless]].''\n\nIn the northern part of the upper area there will be several cages with [[half-soulless]] in them, one of whom has the remains of the dove. Head northwards along the western cave wall ledge, and jump across the first broken bridge on the right. From here, go north at the junction, then east at the next junction, then north, and finally west to a cage on a dead-end platform (shown circled on the map above). Equip Klank's gauntlets if you haven't already and search the cage for [[Iban's dove]]. Sometimes there is no popup telling you that you found it, so keep an eye on your chatbox. The half-soulless will exclaim 'Kuluf Ali Monopiate'.\n\n'''Note:''' The remains will automatically be smeared onto the doll when searching the correct cage.\n\n===Killing Iban===\n{{Needed|[[Doll of Iban]].}}\n[[File:Underground Pass confronting Iban.png|thumb|The stand-off against Iban.]]\n\nNow, to finally destroy Iban and bring an end to this quest. You'll need to jump your way to Iban's temple in the centre of the area(If you are having trouble with the jumps due to low agility levels, starting from the west side near the half souless has the least amount of jumps, albeit a lot longer). Once you're there, kill a [[disciple of Iban]] and take his [[Zamorak monk robes]]. (Collecting a few of the robe bottoms is highly lucrative!)\n\n'''(Should you die attempting to dispose of the doll, you will have to run through the entirety of the dungeon again, so be sure to bring the items required with you.)'''\n\nEnter the temple wearing both upper and lower Zamorak robes. Iban will recognise the doll and declare he cannot die, as well as that you are Zamorak's slave regardless. He then begins to attack you, represented by red spikes that will haphazardly appear near the entrance for several ticks. These spikes rapidly deal around 5 to 8 damage each and can't be blocked with prayers. They also stun you and teleport you back to the entrance, so make sure you run in with plenty of health. Running directly to the well should be fairly easy with one or two food items.\n\n''A method to never get hit by Iban's spell is to enter the temple, immediately exit and then walk back inside, which should roughly coincide with the end of his first round of attacks. Then quickly run to the well in the centre of the room and use the doll before he launches his next volley.''\n\nUse the [[Doll of iban|doll]] on the Well of the Damned in the centre of the room. '''You may have to do this a few times, as his attacks may interrupt you.''' When you do manage to get the doll into the well, Iban will be taken by darkness and destroyed utterly. The temple will begin to collapse and you drop into a cavern below. You also receive [[Iban's staff]], which the man had dropped.\n[[File:Underground Pass Iban's attack.png|thumb|Iban's fearsome attacks.]]\n'''Note: You can use the doll on the well while in dialogue. It's possible to reach the well before being attacked, taking 0 damage.'''\n\nMake your way through this cave to meet [[Koftik]], who will be sane again and suffer from memory loss with Iban's voice suddenly gone. You inform him that you have slain Iban and vaguely remember some of your actions such as crushing the unicorn and killing the paladins, unsure whether it really happened. He will lead you back to the entrance of the Pass.\n\nLeave the cavern and return to [[Ardougne]] to tell [[King Lathas]] of your success to finish the quest. He will thank you for your service and enquire whether the passage to the west is now clear. Upon being told that the temple was destroyed, he says he will send his mages to clear the well so that you can stop his brother Tyras, who he reminds you joined forces with the [[Dark Lord]] on his expedition after being corrupted by the [[Chalice of Eternity]].\n\n'''Note:''' For souvenir collectors, '''all quest items will be removed upon completing the quest'''. In order to keep the desired quest item(s), it/they should be dropped before speaking to King Lathas to complete the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Underground Pass\n|image = [[File:Underground Pass reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 5\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Agility|3,000}} [[Agility]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Attack|3,000}} [[Attack]] experience\n*[[Iban's staff]] and use of the [[Iban Blast]] spell.\n*[[Klank's gauntlets]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Underground Pass is required for the following:\n*[[Legends' Quest]]\n*[[Regicide]]\n*[[Freeing Sir Amik Varze]]\n*[[Ardougne Diary|Ardougne Achievement Diary - Medium]]\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 25 July 2019\n|update = Song of the Elves\n|change = Several changes are made to the Underground Pass quest, along with the release of [[Song of the Elves]]. These changes include, but are not limited to:\n* The entire Underground Pass quest now takes place in an [[instance]].\n* [[Koftik]] no longer appears in multiple locations inside the dungeon, during the quest. Instead, he moves along with the player's progress, and a backpack containing [[oily cloth]] is left behind near the rope bridge instead.\n* The three paladins ([[Sir Carl]], [[Sir Harry]], and [[Sir Jerro]]) no longer respawn after their badges have been dropped in the well. Similarly, one cannot get duplicates of the orbs of light.\n* The patches of swamp found further in the dungeon are removed.

When automatically moving west one space each time a flower is planted, the player will safely move across the grid without triggering the trap. This was patched in 2016; however, a new workaround arose where you could place the seeds after stepping onto the first tile, meaning there was a chance of failure. This method was also patched, in 2018. Theoretically, it was also possible to burn logs to cross the grid in the same fashion; however, doing so would have required too much inventory space to be effective.\n*If you speak to [[Koftik]] at the mesh grid, he will say \"''The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men''\". This is the beginning of the misquoted Bible verse \"Ezekiel 25:17\" that Samuel L. Jackson's character, Jules, recites in the movie ''{{wp|Pulp Fiction}}''. He may also say \"''The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result''\", a quote often incorrectly attributed to {{wp|Albert Einstein}}.\n*Before when attempting to climb down the well, found in the room with the orbs of light and a Chaos Altar, the player would take 10 damage. However, if the player was below 10&nbsp;hp they would lose the remaining hitpoints minus 1. This has since been removed.\n*You can use [[High Level Alchemy]] on the witch's cat.\n*In ''[[RuneScape Classic]]'', the player would periodically receive strange and threatening messages from Iban in red text while in the Underground Passage. When the quest was converted for ''RuneScape 2'', [[classicrsw:Transcript:Iban|these messages]] lost their ominous red colouring, and would appear as standard game messages instead. The messages would remain that way in ''Old School RuneScape'' up until the numerous adjustments introduced alongside the [[Song of the Elves]], which saw the whispers of Iban being attributed to a \"Mysterious Voice\" uttering blue lines of dialogue in the chatbox, not unlike how public player messages are rendered.\n**The messages appear with a randomised delay after crossing specific tiles, ranging from 0 to 9 seconds.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1232279101131706379|date=25 February 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200430035217/https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1232279101131706379|archivedate=30 April 2020|quote=[Are there triggers for the messages you receive while doing underground pass of iban saying things to you like \"I'm watching you adventurer...\"?

You can buy it from the [[Varrock General Store]], which is just north of [[Blue Moon Inn]]. The closest general store to Draynor is in [[Lumbridge]]. There is also a hammer spawn point upstairs in the [[Falador]] [[furnace]] room.\n\n===Count Draynor===\n'''Items needed:'''  [[weapon]],  [[armour]], [[food]], [[garlic]], [[hammer]] and a [[stake]].[[File:Fighting Count Draynor.png|thumb|right|250px|A player fights against Count Draynor.]]\nNow that you have the required items, you must now fight the [[vampyre]]. Make sure you have a [[weapon]], [[armour]], [[food]], [[garlic]], a [[hammer]] and the [[stake]]. Go to  [[Draynor Manor]]. Once inside, go down the large stairs on the east side of the building. There will be a [[coffin (Vampyre Slayer)|coffin]] in the centre of the room. Open it and the vampyre, [[Count Draynor]], will pop up and attack you. If you have garlic, the Count will be weakened, though he will still pose a huge threat to players with a low [[combat level]]. Count Draynor can be safespotted by running to the corner between the right side of the staircase and the wall, then stepping on the same tile as Count Draynor to cause him to take that corner tile, then stepping one more tile to the right to attack him diagonally. Getting him to move into the corner can take several attempts. The candles around the Count's coffin will also \"burn your feet\" if you stand on top of them, but they deal no damage. When you defeat the Count, you will automatically stab him with the hammer and the stake.\n\nYou can exit [[Draynor Manor]] through the exit in the eastern-most room or teleport.\n\n*If the player does not have a hammer with them, they will receive a tooltip: \"You are unable to push the stake far enough in\" and will be unable to kill the Vampyre.\n*If the player takes too long to kill Count Draynor, he will return to his coffin and heal to full health, and the player will have to start the fight all over again.\n*You can set-up a Dwarf Multi Cannon in this area.\n*The garlic effect is immediate upon beginning melee combat with the Count. He will take 10 damage, and his stats will be lowered: -10 to Strength and Attack, and -40 to Defence. Importantly, the debuff effect from garlic only lasts for about 30 seconds. Take advantage of the effective accuracy boost with hard hitting melee weapons while it lasts. \n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Reward==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Vampyre Slayer\n|image = [[File:Vampyre Slayer reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 3\n|rewards =\n*{{SCP|Attack|4,825}} [[Attack]] [[experience]]\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Count Draynor]] accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Vampyre Slayer is required for the following:\n*[[Sins of the Father]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 4 June 2020\n|update = Darkmeyer\n|poll =\n|change = The word \"vampire\" within the quest's name and dialogue was changed to \"vampyre\" for lore consistency.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Players who complete this quest with an [[Attack]] level of 1 will gain 19 Attack levels, resulting in an Attack level of 20.\n*This counts towards your slayer task if tasked with vampyres \n\n{{Vampyre Slayer}}"

Ask if he has any jobs for you, and he lets you know that a clerk has made an error and that you're not actually permitted to be a [[Temple Knights|Temple Knight]]. It turns out you have to work as a squire for five years. Because this will take too long, Sir Tiffy offers an alternative by exploiting a loophole. He'll then ask you to go see [[Sir Amik Varze]] in the [[White Knights' Castle]].\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Sir Amik Varze===\n:'''''Note:''' If wearing [[Initiate armour]] during the chat with [[Sir Amik Varze]], the dialogue will be different, but you may still go through the quest without it.''\n[[File:Sir Amik Varze chathead.png|left]]\n\nSpeak to [[Sir Amik Varze]] by going up 2 flights of stairs, on the west side in the [[White Knights' Castle]] in [[Falador]]. He will ask you to become a squire after a small conversation. '''Decline his offer''', and the conversation will continue. If you do not decline his offer to become a squire, he will ask for [[Asgarnian ale]] in an endless loop. Speak to [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] to undo this.\n\nIt turns out that there needs to be a crisis for you to become a deputy, but there is no current crisis. Report back to Sir Tiffy in the [[Falador Park]]. For some players, Sir Tiffy will not say anything about a crisis until you have spoken to him a few times. Eventually, Sir Tiffy will inform you of a crisis that has arisen. Head back to talk to Sir Amik again.\n\nSir Amik will tell you the news that a criminal named [[Solus Dellagar]], the \"infamous murder-mage,\" is back. Sir Amik mentions they have been unable to capture Solus Dellagar due to his powers and, to only kill Solus Dellagar as a last resort. Join the White Knights, and accept the mission to pursue Solus Dellagar.\n\n===The Communication Orb===\n{{Needed|10,000 coins '''or''' 1 [[law rune]], 1 [[molten glass]], and 1 [[enchanted gem]].}}\n[[File:Savant chathead.png|left]]\n\nOnce again, go back to [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]]. It turns out you're just the \"agent\" that needs to locate [[Solus Dellagar]]. As an agent, you need to be in constant communication. Sir Tiffy offers you a communication device for 10,000 [[coins]], or he can make one if you bring the supplies. Give Sir Tiffy the money or the supplies (a [[law rune]], an [[enchanted gem]] and [[molten glass]]). Either way, you'll receive a [[Commorb]] from him. It is needed for the whole quest.\n\nUse the \"contact\" feature on the orb to talk to [[Savant]]. It turns out that you should investigate the [[Black Knights' Base|Black Knight Hideout]] in [[Taverley Dungeon]], and investigate the [[Mage of Zamorak]] in [[Varrock]] that is interested in [[Runecraft]].\n\nIf you lose your [[Commorb]] after acquiring one, [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] will lend you his.\n\n===Taverley Dungeon===\n{{Needed|Combat [[equipment]] to kill [[Black Knight]]s, the Commorb, and [[Antipoison]] for low-level players.|recommended=Teleport method to [[Falador]].}}\n{{Map|x:2884,y:3397|plane=0|mapID=0|align=right|r=5|mtype=square|zoom=1|caption=The [[Taverley Dungeon|dungeon]]'s location, south of [[Taverley]].}}\n\nNext, head over to the [[Taverley Dungeon]].\n{{Checklist|\n*From the west [[bank]] in [[Falador]], you can use the [[Agility]] [[shortcut]] (level 5 Agility required), and keep heading north-west towards [[Taverley]] until you see a ladder.\n*Use the ladder and follow the dungeon\n**North\n**Then east\n**Then south past the [[magic axe]]s, [[Poison Scorpion]]s, [[chaos dwarves]] (do not cross the bridge)\n**And finally past the [[Hill Giant]]s, and into the [[Black Knight]]s' rooms.\n}}\n[[File:Wanted! - Solus meets with Lord Daquarius.png|thumb|left|Solus meets with [[Lord Daquarius]].]]\n'''Warning:''' The black knights are aggressive if you are under 67 combat; you can stand on the north-western corner of the room to hop worlds if you want to avoid them.\n\nContinue through the double doors, and talk to [[Lord Daquarius]] in the south-western-most room. He tells you nothing. [[Savant]] will call you. (Use the '''contact''' option on the [[Commorb]] if she doesn't call automatically.) She advises you to try to bluff him into giving you something. Go kill a level 33 [[Black Knight]] to make Lord Daquarius give in and beg you not to kill any more of his men. He tells you that [[Solus Dellagar]] is in a place with a lot of [[fur]], but that the fur is not from a [[bear]].\n\n:'''Note:''' The Black Knight kill won't count if you kill it before talking to Lord Daquarius, if you leave the room after the kill, or if you get interrupted during the ensuing conversation.\n\n===Zamorak Mage===\n{{Needed|The Commorb and either 20 unnoted [[Rune essence|rune]] OR [[pure essence]] (must all be of the same type).}}\n{{Map|3256,3391|3264,3391|3264,3380|3253,3380|3253,3386|3256,3386|mtype=polygon|align=left|caption=Location of the Chaos Temple in Varrock.}}\n'''Note:''' Do not equip any Saradomin or Guthix items (such as [[Void Knight equipment]]) or the Zamorak Mage will refuse to speak with you. In addition, if you have talked to the Zamorak Mage within the wilderness prior you can go straight to the [[Varrock#Altars of Zamorak|Chaos Altar]] in Varrock.\n\n'''Warning:''' The [[Wilderness]] is a dangerous place, proceed with caution and only bring items you are willing to lose.\n\nIf you haven't done the [[Enter the Abyss|Abyss miniquest]], bank all your items and follow the river between [[Edgeville]] and the [[Grand Exchange]] into the [[Wilderness]] to find the [[Mage of Zamorak]]. He will then tell you to meet him \"somewhere\" in [[Varrock]], which is the Chaos Altar in the temple in south-east Varrock. Grab 20 unnoted [[Rune essence|rune]]/[[pure essence]] from the bank and head to the Chaos Altar.\n\nIf you have completed the miniquest, go directly to the Chaos Altar with 20 unnoted [[Rune essence|rune]] essence.\n\n[[File:Wanted! - Solus confronts Mage of Zamorak.png|thumb|Solus meets with the Zamorakian [[Mage of Zamorak|mage]].]]\nTalk to him about [[Solus Dellagar]], and make sure you do not wear anything of [[Guthix]] or [[Saradomin]] (including Void). The Zamorak Mage wants your [[Commorb|orb]] in return for information, but [[Savant]] explains that it would be useless to him. He offers to trade his information for 20 rune essence instead. Talk to him again with the unnoted essence. The mage gives your character the tip that Solus went east. Your character connects \"east\" with the previous tip, \"fur,\" and realises that Solus must be in [[Canifis]] with the [[Werewolf|werewolves]].{{clear|left}}\n\n===Canifis===\nEither run to [[Canifis]] or, if you have completed [[Ghosts Ahoy]], grab your [[Ectophial]] from the bank to teleport to Port Phasmatys and run from there. Alternatively, you teleport to the [[Slayer Tower]] using a [[Slayer ring]] and run south, or use the [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|cks}}, or using [[Fenkenstrain's castle teleport]] tab to get nearby.\n\n[[File:Wanted! - encountering Solus.png|thumb|The player encounters Solus for the first time.]]\nOnce in Canifis, [[Savant]] will call you and tell you in a lengthy conversation that Solus is probably using a unique \"slow teleport\", which makes him invisible. If you accidentally keep running and skip the conversation with Savant, step outside the town back to the fairy ring and the conversation will trigger again. Now, use the \"scan\" option on your [[Commorb]] as you walk around the town until you uncover [[Solus Dellagar]]. Solus briefly appears, speaks with you, and disappears.\n\n===Chasing Solus===\n[[File:Wanted! - Solus disguised.png|thumb|Solus disguises himself as a woman to distract the player.]]\n[[File:Wanted! - Solus attacks.png|thumb|[[Solus Dellagar]] strikes the player with the [[Flames of Zamorak]].]]\nSavant then calls and finds that she is able to pull items off of Solus as he escapes. These items give the player a clue as to Solus' next whereabouts. From this point on, the player will be chasing Solus throughout ''[[RuneScape]]'', and each time Solus is found, he will leave behind an item. That item is a hint for where to go next. There are '''seven''' locations in total, and each location is random, except for the [[Champions' Guild]], the [[Dorgesh-Kaan Mine]], and the [[Rune essence mine]], which are always the third, fifth, and seventh locations, respectively (including Canifis). '''The items received for the second, fourth, and sixth locations are always random.''' Listed below are all of the items that may be received, as well as the location they point to.\n\n====Predetermined items====\nThese items always appear in a predetermined order.\n*[[Blue cape]] - Inside [[Champions' Guild]]. This location is always the third location. Solus will cast a [[Smoke Barrage]] spell on the player, disorienting them but neither dealing damage nor inflicting poison.\n*[[Bone spear]] - [[Dorgesh-Kaan mine]] - A [[light source]] is required. The player should follow [[Kazgar]] to the mines (not the water mill) then scan for Solus. This location is always the fifth location. A [[Woman (Wanted!)|woman]] will appear, claiming to be taken hostage by Solus. However, the woman turns out to be Solus himself, who will sucker punch the player and leave (via moonwalk). Note that you do '''not''' need to finish [[The Lost Tribe]] in order to complete this step. You only need to progress far enough in The Lost Tribe to clear the rubble in the Lumbridge castle basement and proceed through the tunnel behind it.\n*[[Rune essence|Rune]]/[[pure essence]] (20 noted) - [[Rune essence mine]]s. This is the final location; Solus will be fought here.\n\n====Random items====\nThese items appear in a random order, and vary from player to player.\n{| class=\"wikitable align-center-1\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Item\n!Savant says\n!Location\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Fremennik purple cloak}}\n|It's... a cloak?\n|[[Rellekka]]\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Banana}}\n|It's...a banana?\n|[[Musa Point]] [[banana plantation]]\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Blue wizard hat}}\n|It's...a wizard hat?\n|[[Wizards' Tower]] south of Draynor Village, {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} library\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Bone spear}}\n|It's... a very strange weapon?\n|[[Dorgesh-Kaan mine]] - Bring a light source, and follow the goblin to the mines and [[Nardok's Bone Weapons]] in order to scan for Solus.

A quick way there is using a Spirit Tree to the Khazard Battlefield.\n|}\n\n[[Solus Dellagar]] will also react based on which scan location out of seven the player is at.\n*If it is the '''second''' scan location, Solus will forcibly teleport the player to [[Camelot]].\n*If it is the '''fourth''' scan location, Solus will attempt to personally ward the player off with a particularly strong cast of [[Flames of Zamorak]]. The damage he deals is equal to a percentage of the player's '''current''' [[Hitpoints]] total. At level 99 [[Hitpoints]] with maximum boosts it will deal up to 96 damage, 111 damage when the player has 121 Hitpoints when boosted with an Anglerfish. The damage he deals is typeless, meaning [[protection prayers]] have no effect on it. However, no matter how much damage it inflicts, it will '''never''' kill the player as [[Savant]] will protect them and teleport them back to [[Falador]], in the [[White Knights' Castle]] with all items intact.\n*If it is the '''sixth''' scan location (the one before the [[Rune essence mine]]), Solus will summon a level 32 [[Black Knight (Wanted!)|Black Knight]] in an attempt to take the player out. [[Armour]] and a [[weapon]] should be brought. It is not necessary to kill the Black Knight; you can simply run away.\n\n===Confronting Solus===\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Wanted! - Solus decimates rangers.png|thumb|[[Solus Dellagar]]'s powerful [[Ice Barrage]] attack.]]\nThe final clue will be 20 noted [[Pure essence|pure]]/[[rune essence]]. Bank and equip a weapon and armour for the final fight. Use any rune essence teleport spot you want, and [[Savant]] will close off possible teleports in order to trap him. After a small cutscene, Savant will summon 15 rangers to assist you, but Solus kills them all with [[Ice Barrage]].\n\n[[File:Wanted! - Fighting Solus.png|thumb|The final battle.]]\nGo attack Solus yourself and kill him, and you'll get his [[Solus's hat|hat]]. He's fairly easy as he has been weakened after using such a powerful attack on the Temple Knight rangers. He has no specific [[Combat level]], has 40 [[Hitpoints]] and only uses a weak, but fairly rapid melee attack. After the fight, Savant congratulates you. You are returned to the rune essence teleport location. If you lose Solus's hat, contact Savant for another one. You will lose Solus's hat if your inventory is full at the end of the fight.\n\n===Finishing===\nReturn to [[Falador]]. Talk to [[Sir Amik Varze]] in the [[White Knights' Castle]], and hand over the hat. To keep a hat for after the quest, [[drop trick]] it before talking to him. He'll explain to you about the [[White equipment|new armour]] system and killing [[Black Knight]]s (and [[White Knight]]s).\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Wanted!\n|image = [[File:Wanted! reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Slayer|5,000}} [[Slayer]] [[experience]]\n*Access to the armoury of the [[White Knight]]s ([[White equipment]])\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Wanted! is required for the following:\n*[[Devious Minds]]\n*[[The Slug Menace]]\n*[[While Guthix Sleeps]]\n*Elite tier of the Falador Diary\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Knight Rankings==\nIn order to increase your ranking, you must kill a certain number of [[Black Knight]]s.

[[File:Hardcore_ironman_chat_badge.png]] [[Ironman Mode|Hardcore ironmen]] may have an especially difficult time if they do not wish to enter the [[Wilderness]] to kill [[Green dragon|Green dragons]]. Dragon bones can be obtained in the [[Nightmare Zone]] by killing [[Elvarg]], after the completion of [[Dragon Slayer I]].\n\nThere is also a [[fairy ring]] located north-west of [[Yanille]] (code: {{Fairycode|ciq}}). From the ring, enter Yanille, and use the [[shortcut]] by the [[farming patch]] (requires 16 [[Agility]]).\n\n===Getting started===\n'''''Items needed:''' [[Armour]], [[weapon]] ([[slashing weapon]] recommended), [[food]], 2 [[rope]]s, and [[dragon bones]].''\n[[File:Watchtower - Searching the bushes.png|thumb|220px|Searching the bushes near the Watchtower.]]\n\nMake your way to the [[Watchtower (building)|Watchtower]] just  north of the northwest corner of [[Yanille]]. Climb the trellis on the northern side of the tower. Then, climb up the ladder and talk to the [[Watchtower wizard]]. He will explain that the Watchtower is not working because the spell created does not keep out [[ogres]]. He tells you that the [[Crystal (Watchtower)|crystals]] that make the spell have been stolen! After starting, you will be asked to search the grounds of the Watchtower. You can now use the tower's main ladder, but using the trellis avoids a conversation with the guard and gives you 31 [[Agility]] [[experience]] each time. Search the '''far north-west''' [[Bush (Watchtower)|bush]] for some [[fingernails]]. It is possible to find some other things in other bushes ([[old robe]], [[unusual armour]], [[damaged dagger]], [[tattered eye patch]]), but these items serve no purpose other than as a red herring.\n\n{{Map|mtype=pin|caption=A map of all bushes that contain items.|zoom=3\n|x:2545,y:3134,icon:greenPin,title:[[Fingernails]],desc:\n|x:2547,y:3130,icon:redPin,title:[[Tattered eye patch]],desc:\n|x:2550,y:3135,icon:redPin,title:[[Damaged dagger]],desc:\n|x:2559,y:3132,icon:redPin,title:[[Unusual armour]],desc:\n|x:2560,y:3123,icon:redPin,title:[[Old robe]],desc:\n}}\n\nGo back to the Watchtower wizard, and show him the fingernails. The wizard will tell you that the fingernails belong to [[Skavid]]s, the servants of the ogres, and that they have stolen the four [[Crystal (Watchtower)|power crystals]] that protect the city from ogres. Your job is to recover the crystals.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is gain access to the city. In order to enter, you'll need to help out three [[Ogre chieftain|ogre tribe chieftains]] to get pieces of an [[ogre relic]]. This can then be given to the gate guards to prove that you're a friend to the ogres.\n[[File:Watchtower - Quest map.png|thumb|centre|500px|All the important locations throughout the quest.]]\n\n[[File:Watchtower - Speaking to Og.png|thumb|220px|Speaking to Og.]]\n\n===Og===\n''Note: The Ogres near all three camps are non-aggressive.''\nFirst, go through the city of [[Yanille]] using the [[agility shortcut]] or the west entrance. Stop at the bank to grab your [[armour]], [[food]], two [[rope]]s, and one set of [[dragon bones]] if you haven't already. Head out the west gate and turn north-west to find a tribe of ogres. Note that, as a rule of thumb, any ogre that wields a [[mace]] is [[non-aggressive]]. Talk to [[Og]] to learn that his nemesis, [[Toban]], stole a [[Toban's gold|bar of gold]] from him. Your job is to get it back. Og will give you a [[Toban's key|key]] to Toban's chest. Keep this key with you for later.\n\n===Grew===\n[[File:Watchtower - Speaking to Grew.png|thumb|220px|Speaking to Grew.]]\nHead south of [[Og]]'s tribe. You should see an island with an ogre tribe on it and some [[jangerberries]]. Find the long-branched tree on the west shore. Use one [[rope]] on the branch of the tree (not the tree itself) to swing to the island. Note that you will lose the rope. Take some jangerberries because you'll need them later in the quest. Talk to [[Grew]]. Grew will tell you to teach his enemy, [[Gorad]], a lesson by knocking one of his [[Ogre tooth|teeth]] out (make sure that you have room in your inventory for this tooth, or you will have to kill him again).\n\n===Toban, and Gorad's tooth===\nThe next stop is a third tribe of ogres. Leave Grew's island using the tree with the rope swing on the north side.\n\nEither enter the [[Skavid caves]] south of Grew's island ''4'' times without the [[Skavid map]], or head south-east to go around [[Gu'Tanoth]].\n\nYou will see a broken bridge leading to a small island. The next tribe you will need to meet is on that island, but the bridge is out so you will need to find another way across. Keep going a little bit south of the bridge.\n\nThen, turn west and continue along the southern edge of Gu'tanoth until you reach a hole surrounded by rocks. Pick up the [[death rune]] a ways south of this hole if you need it. ''The hole is west-north-west of the [[Gnome Glider|gnome glider]]. ''(See map above).\n[[File:Watchtower - Fighting Gorad.png|thumb|220px|Fighting Gorad.]]\nEnter the hole to reach an island with [[Toban]]'s tribe on it. South of the ladder, you should find a level 68 chieftain called [[Gorad]]. Talk to him and tell him that you have come to knock his teeth out. He will attack you. Kill him to get a [[Ogre tooth|tooth]]. Keep the tooth for later. Gorad can be [[safespotted]] in the centre of the island for [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] users.\n\nNext, speak to Toban. He will ask you to give him the bones of a dragon to chew on. Give him your [[dragon bones]] (baby dragon bones do NOT work). '''<u>Make sure not to bury them!</u>''' Toban will give you the [[Relic part 3|third piece]] of the [[Ogre relic|relic]] in return.\n\nOpen Toban's chest on the island, and you will find [[Og]]'s [[Toban's gold|stolen gold]].\n\nA [[rope]] spawns on the island (next to the roots south-west of the ladder) if you don't already have one for travelling back to [[Grew]]'s island.\n\n===Completing the relic===\n[[File:Watchtower - Combining relic parts.gif|thumb|200px|The Watchtower Wizard combines the three relic parts.]]\nLeave the island via the ladder. Walk around the west side of the [[ogre city]] or use a [[ring of dueling]] or the [[Grouping]] teleport to [[Castle Wars]], or use Fairy code '''CIQ''', and walk back to [[Grew]]'s island (with the [[jangerberries]]). Use your second [[rope]] on the tree. Talk to Grew to give him [[Gorad]]'s [[Ogre tooth|tooth]]. You will receive another [[Relic part 2|piece of the relic]] in return for your deed. He will also give you the first [[Crystal (quest item)|crystal]], the yellow crystal. Keep this for later. '''If you don't have jangerberries yet, pick some from the island <u>before you leave</u>.''' Then, leave the island using the rope swing and head north back to [[Og]]. Talk to him to give him his stolen [[Toban's gold|gold bar]]. You will receive the final [[Relic part 1|piece of the relic]].\n\nOnce you have all three parts of the relic, take them to the [[Watchtower wizard]] to get them assembled. Head through [[Yanille]], and use the [[agility shortcut]] if possible. While at the Watchtower, pick up a [[candle]] at the spawn on the ground level if you need a [[light source]].\n\n===Access to Gu'Tanoth===\n'''''Items needed:''' 20 [[coins]] (27 coins if you need to buy a [[pestle and mortar]] and [[vial]]), [[anti-dragon shield]], a [[death rune]], and the [[Ogre relic]]. Bring your [[gold bar]], [[tinderbox]], and [[light source]] as well to save a bank trip.''\n\nAfter you have the full relic, head back through [[Yanille]] and either use the southern grapple shortcut or get out directly from the west gate. Grab a [[Unlit torch|Torch]] from [[Aleck's Hunter Emporium.|Aleck's]] shop on the way through Yanille, if you don't have a light source for the caves later on.\n\nHead south-east until you see a path leading up into [[Gu'Tanoth]], then go south and follow the path up the hill. Alternatively, use the [[Skavid caves]] \"transport system\" ''2'' times without the [[Skavid Map]].\n\nAt the split, take the north-west trail to the [[Ogre guard]]s. Talk to them (with the [[Ogre relic]] in your inventory), and they will let you into the city (using your relic on them doesn't work, as \"The ogre has not asked you for anything\").\n\nOnce you're inside the city, go east and then south to the market. The ogres aren't aggressive, but watch out for the [[Ogre trader]]s, who will attack if spoken to. There is also a non-aggressive merchant named [[Ogre merchant|Grud]] (labelled Ogre merchant) who will sell you [[Herblore]] supplies. Buy a [[pestle and mortar]] and [[vial]] (7 [[coins]] total) from him for later use if you do not already have them in your inventory. Find the [[Counter (Gu'Tanoth)|southern stall]] in the market with food (grey cylinders) on it, and then steal a [[rock cake]]. Be careful with the cake as the left-click option eats it, dealing damage and forcing you to go steal another.\n\nGo back on the main path to the west and follow it south. You'll find two more guards. Talk to one. '''Be careful of what you say, '''the guard will knock you out of the area if you mess up. Tell them you are a friend of the ogres (first option); they will then ask for some food from the market. '''Do not eat the rock cake!''' Use the rock cake on the guard to get by. Then, continue on until you find a broken bridge. Attempt to jump the gap in the bridge. (Find the \"Jump-Over\" by clicking on your side of the gap for a red X option). The guards will ask for money, so pay them 20 coins to cross the gap. Grab the [[knife]] here if you need a [[slash weapon]]; you will need it later for webs.\n[[File:Watchtower - Talking to city guards.png|thumb|220px|The guards who give you the [[Skavid map]].]]\nPass the aggressive ogre and you will find several city guards. If you talk to them, they'll give you a word puzzle. The answer to the puzzle is \"''death rune''\". Give the guard the death rune you grabbed earlier and he will give you a map of the [[Skavid Caves]].\n:'''*Note:''' One of the medium tasks in the [[Ardougne achievement diary]] requires you to have a [[Skavid map]]. If you ever plan on doing these tasks, you should keep the map so that you don't have to come back here to get another. This task is automatically completed during the quest.\n\n===Skavid caves===\n'''''Items needed:''' [[Skavid map]], a [[light source]] and a [[gold bar]].''\n[[File:Skavid caves numbered.png|thumb|250px|Skavid map]]\n[[File:Watchtower - Scared skavid is silenced.png|thumb|220px|A skavid is silenced while speaking to the player.]]\nThe [[Skavid Caves]] are a series of caves located beneath the ogre city. Their entrances are scattered around the north and east sides of the city. You need the [[Skavid map]] and a [[light source]] to get in.\n\nYou will need to first find the [[Scared skavid]] (he can be found in the cave labelled \"1\"), who will teach you some basic Skavid words if you promise not to hurt it. Then, go to the other four caves and talk to each (regular) [[Skavid]], and give them the correct response (see below). Once it says that they understood you, move on to the next cave with the next Skavid.\n\nTheir locations are:\n\n*1) ([[Scared Skavid]]) East of [[Gu'Tanoth]] along the south-east branch of the entrance path to the city. It will teach you the Skavid language.\n*2) North-east of Gu'Tanoth along the main entrance path to the city. It will say: \"Bidith tanath.\", the correct response is \"Cur.\"\n*3) North of Gu'Tanoth near the opening of the main entrance path to the city. It will say: \"Gor cur...\", the correct reponse is \"Ar.\"\n*4) North of Gu'Tanoth south of the west gate to [[Yanille]]. It will say: \"Cur Bidith.\", the correct response is \"Ig.\" Take two [[Cave nightshade]] for a latter part of the quest - picking one is also a medium [[Ardougne Diary]] task.\n*5) East of Gu'Tanoth outside the city around the east side of the mountain (5). It will say: \"Tanath gor.\", the correct reponse is \"Nod.\"\n\nYou can also refer to the map above to find the cave entrances.\n\nReturn to the [[Scared skavid]]. It will tell you that you're ready to take on the [[Mad skavid]].\n\nGo south of the [[Scared skavid]] cave along the south-east path of the entrance to the [[Ogre City]] and '''use the gold bar on one of the guards''' to gain access. Go south and west across the bridge and enter the cave (6). Talk to the mad skavid and respond with the language you just learned.\n\n:If he says \"''Ar cur''\", the correct response is \"''Gor''\".\n:If he says \"''Bidith ig''\", the correct response is \"''Cur''\".\n:If he says \"''Gor nod''\", the correct response is \"''Tanath''\".\n:If he says \"''Cur tanath''\", the correct response is \"''Bidith''\".\n:If he says \"''Bidith tanath''\", the correct response is \"''Cur''\".\n:If he says \"''Tanath gor''\", the correct response is \"''Nod''\".\n:If he says \"''Cur bidith''\", the correct response is \"''Ig''\".\n:If he says \"''Gor cur''\", the correct response is \"''Ar''\".\n\nIf you respond correctly, the Skavid will give you a magenta [[Crystal (Watchtower)|crystal]]. If you have not yet got two [[cave nightshade]]s, take two at the spawn inside. '''Do not''' eat the nightshade as it will cause damage to you. The hole in the corner will take you back to [[Yanille]]<ref>After entering the hole in Mad Skavid's cave that take you back to Yanille, the message in the chat box appears \"So that's how the skavids are getting into Yanille!\"</ref>. Take it if you need to access a bank for the next part of the quest.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>(Medium task in the [[Ardougne achievement diary]])\n\n===The Ogre Enclave===\n'''''Items needed:''' [[Anti-dragon shield]], [[food]] and 2 [[cave nightshade]]s.''\n[[File:Watchtower - Shaman kills dragon.gif|frame|The Ogre shaman deals a powerful hit to a Blue dragon.]]\nMake sure you have your [[anti-dragon shield]] equipped. Go back to the [[Gu'Tanoth]] marketplace (just west of where you stole the [[rock cake]]) and use one of your [[nightshade]]s on an enclave guard, near a cave entrance on the west, to distract them (attempting to talk to the guards will prompt them to attack you regardless of dialogue options chosen). '''Be careful – use and eat are swapped around, do not eat a cave nightshade. Additionally, make sure you complete the dialogue, or else you will have to get another cave nightshade.''' After continuing the dialogue, a warning alert regarding the danger of the enclave will appear, proceed forward if you are ready and you will automatically enter the [[Ogre Enclave]].\n\nYou'll see a short cutscene with an [[Ogre shaman]] and a [[Blue dragon]]. '''Do not talk-to or attack the shamans, or you will instantly lose 20 or 30 [[Hitpoints]], respectively.''' The last two [[Crystal (Watchtower)|crystals]] are here, but you can't get them without some help.\n\nRun straight past the blue dragons and out the exit at the north end. You will appear outside one of the northern [[Skavid caves]] facing to [[Yanille]].\n\n===Magic ogre potion===\n'''''Items needed:''' An empty or water-filled [[vial]], [[guam leaf]], [[pestle and mortar]], [[jangerberries]], and [[bat bones]].''\n\nHead north into [[Yanille]]. Stop at the bank to get a vial (with or without water), a guam leaf, a pestle and mortar, jangerberries, and bat bones if you have them.\n\nHead back toward the [[Watchtower (building)|Watchtower]]. If you need bat bones, a little east of the Watchtower, you'll find a house whose entrance is covered in webs. Take a [[slashing weapon]] or a [[knife]], cut through the web and enter the building. You will find several [[giant bat]]s. Kill one and take its bones.\n\nReturn to the Watchtower. If your vial is empty, fill it at the fountain outside.\n\nClimb the ladders and talk to the [[Watchtower wizard]]. He will tell you that you can make a potion to destroy the [[ogre shaman]]s.\n\n'''You must add the ingredients in this order:'''\n#Add a [[guam leaf]] to a [[vial of water]].\n#Add some [[jangerberries]]. '''Be careful because the left-click option is to eat.''' If accidentally eaten, they respawn on [[Grew]]'s island - you'll need another [[rope]]. Alternatively, you can use telegrab if you do not have a rope.\n#Use your [[pestle and mortar]] on the [[bat bones]] to grind them. Add the [[ground bat bones]] to the vial mixture. The vial will turn into a [[Potion (Watchtower)|potion]].\n#Give the potion to the [[Watchtower wizard]] to get it enchanted, turning it into [[magic ogre potion]].\n\n===Shaman slaying===\n'''''Items needed:''' Some [[food]], [[anti-dragon shield]], a [[pickaxe]], a dwarven stout if your mining isn't level 40,  [[cave nightshade]] and the [[magic ogre potion]]''\n[[File:Watchtower - Killing ogre shaman.gif|right|frame|Using the magic ogre potion to kill the ogre shamans.]]\nReturn to the [[Yanille]] bank to prepare for the [[blue dragon]] and shaman enclave. Bring your pickaxe, an anti-dragonfire shield, cave nightshade and some food. Now, go back to the market place in [[Gu'Tanoth]]. Distract the cave guards using your second nightshade, and enter the cave. Again, you must complete the dialogue by using the spacebar or pressing ''click here'' to continue, or else you will have to get another cave nightshade.\nRun around the cave and use the [[magic ogre potion]] on each of the six [[ogre shaman]]s while avoiding the blue dragons as much as possible. The potion will instantly kill the shamans and you won't take any damage. The last shaman you kill will drop the [[Crystal (Watchtower)|cyan crystal]], which is automatically put into your inventory.\n\n[[File:Watchtower - Mining Rock of Dalgroth.png|thumb|left|220px|Mining the final crystal.]]\nIf you somehow lose the cyan crystal, there is a [[Shaman robe]] in the south-east corner, amongst some bones where you can pick it up and search it for the crystal.\n\nTo get the last [[Crystal (Watchtower)|crystal]], find the [[Rock of Dalgroth]] in the [[Ogre Enclave]] in the centre of the Enclave and mine it with your pickaxe. '''Note: It can only be mined after killing the shamans. This is in the cave with the blue dragons.''' Mine the rock before leaving the cave, otherwise you will need to get nightshades again. Make sure you actually mine the crystal, and don't just prospect.\n\n===Reviving the Watchtower===\n'''''Items needed:''' All 4 [[Crystal (Watchtower)|crystals]].''\n[[File:Watchtower - Correct crystal alignment.png|thumb|220px|The correct crystal positioning.]]\nLeave the [[Ogre Enclave|enclave]] using the far north exit again (or use a [[Nightmare Zone]] [[minigame teleport]]). Grab the yellow crystal if you banked it earlier, and take all four crystals back to the [[Watchtower (building)|Watchtower]]. Talk to the [[Watchtower wizard]], and he will ask you to fix the machine for him.\n\nThe crystals must be placed in the following positions:\n*'''Yellow''' crystal in the '''south-west''' pillar\n*'''Grey''' crystal in the '''south-east''' pillar\n*'''Cyan''' crystal in the '''north-west''' pillar\n*'''Magenta''' crystal in the '''north-east''' pillar\n\nFinally, pull the [[lever (Watchtower)|lever]] on the west side of the room to complete the quest. \n\n'''Note:''' Before pulling the lever to complete the quest, do not drop anything, as the items will be left behind in the instanced version of the Watchtower and lost permanently.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Watchtower\n|image = [[File:Watchtower reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 4\n|rewards = \n*{{SCP|Magic|15,250}} [[Magic]] [[experience]]\n*5,000 [[Coins]]\n*A scroll, the reading of which gives you the ability to use [[Watchtower Teleport]]\n*Access to the ogre city (and [[Ogre Enclave]] where you can fight [[blue dragon]]s.

You will not need armour or weapons for this.''\n[[File:Almera chathead.png|left|frameless]]\nStart out by speaking to [[Almera]] in her house west of the [[Coal Trucks]] and north-east of the [[Baxtorian Falls]] (use the [[games necklace]] to teleport to Barbarian Outpost, and run south). She will tell you that she is worried about her son, [[Hudon]], who is on the opposite side of the river looking for treasure.\n[[File:Waterfall Quest - Shipwrecked raft.png|thumb|220px|Hudon and the crashed boat.]]\nShe will request that you check on him, and will tell you there is a raft outside the house that you can use. Exit Almera's house toward the river and board the [[Log raft (Waterfall Dungeon)|log raft]]; you will crash into a small island.\n\nTalk to Hudon. You will tell him to come back to his mother, but he'll refuse, hoping to stay out and find treasure. When you ask if you can help, he rejects you, saying you will steal his loot.\n\nGo to the south end of the small island, and '''use''' your [[rope]] on the rock in the distance. '''Do not click \"swim,\"''' or you will be sent downstream. The rock you want is at the far south, you may have to pan your camera down in order to see it. After crossing, use your rope on the [[Dead Tree (Waterfall Dungeon)|dead tree]] at the south end of the island to get to a cliff edge alongside the waterfall. If you do not use the rope and instead click on the tree, you will also be sent downstream.\n\nClick on the barrel to get down safely instead of taking damage. If you attempt to open the door in the cliff face right now, you will be washed down river, appearing at the bottom and taking moderate damage.\n\nIf you didn't bring a rope, you can attempt to swim in the river, washing you to near where the barrel normally takes you.\n\nAfter leaving the outlet, you should end up near a large building with a fisherman outside of it. Inside the building, speak to [[Hadley]] and run through all of the options. This is the tourist information centre; go upstairs and search the southernmost [[bookcase (Waterfall Quest)|bookcase]] on the eastern wall to find a book named [[book on baxtorian]].\n\n:'''''Note:'' You must open this book, or the key will not appear for the next part.'''\n\nYou will discover that [[Lord Baxtorian Cadarn|Baxtorian]] and [[Glarial]] were elven, and read about the legend of treasure under the falls. You will also learn that [[Glarial's pebble]] can be found under [[Tree Gnome Village (location)|Tree Gnome Village]], which will give you access to her tomb.\n\n===The Pebble===\n'''''Items required:''' None (decent [[food]] and [[armour]] recommended).''\n{{Map|x:2533,y:3155|x:2545,y:3155|x:2545,y:3148|x:2542,y:3148|x:2542,y:3150|x:2539,y:3150|x:2539,y:3145|x:2549,y:3145|x:2549,y:3156|x:2551,y:3156|x:2551,y:3159|x:2545,y:3159|x:2545,y:3165|x:2550,y:3165|x:2550,y:3175|x:2544,y:3175|x:2544,y:3177|x:2533,y:3177|x:2533,y:3179|x:2531,y:3179|x:2531,y:3177|x:2529,y:3177|x:2529,y:3179|x:2527,y:3179|x:2527,y:3177|x:2514,y:3177|x:2514,y:3179|x:2521,y:3179|x:2521,y:3184|x:2524,y:3184|x:2524,y:3181|x:2529,y:3181|x:2529,y:3182|x:2532,y:3182|x:2532,y:3188|x:2511,y:3188|x:2511,y:3191|x:2503,y:3191|mtype=line|align=right|height=275|width=275|caption=Follow the line to find the Dungeon.}}\nGo south-west of Ardougne to the Tree Gnome Village entrance (if you completed [[Tree Gnome Village]] you can also teleport to Tree Gnome Village from Grand Exchange). If you can, talk to [[Elkoy]], and follow him to the village entrance. If you have not begun [[Tree Gnome Village]] you will have to navigate through the maze. You should find a ladder in the hedge maze. Very low level players should exercise caution due to the [[hobgoblin]]s within. This cave is where you're going to find the pebble. Climb down the ladder. First, obtain [[Key (Gnome Village Dungeon)|the key]] in the east room. The key is found in the slightly differently-coloured crate next to the two crates stacked on top of each other in the south-east corner. Next, you will find a gnome called [[Golrie]] locked in the west room, hiding from the hobgoblins. Use your key on the door, then speak to the gnome to receive [[Glarial's pebble]]. After acquiring the pebble, it is highly encouraged that you start the Tree Gnome Village quest by talking to [[King Bolren]]. The minigame teleport to Fishing Trawler will put you to the east of the maze.\n\n:'''Note:''' Glarial's pebble is needed for the followup quest [[Roving Elves]]. If you plan to complete this later, you can save some time by keeping the pebble after this quest. You can also acquire multiple pebbles by dropping the pebble, and talking to Golrie again. This is strongly advised for lower level players in case you die on the next step.\n\n:'''Quick exit:''' Go back up the ladder and squeeze through the railings to the west. Start the [[Tree Gnome Village]] quest by talking to [[King Bolren]] in the centre of the maze. After you've started the quest, [[Elkoy]] will guide you out of the maze in a few seconds.\n\n===Tomb Raiding===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Glarial's pebble]] and no other items (decent food recommended).''\n[[File:Glarial's tombstone.png|thumb|200px|Glarial's tombstone]]\n{{Map|name=Glarial's Tombstone|x:2558,y:3445|plane=0|r=4|mapID=0|mtype=square|align=right|height=250|width=250|caption=Glarial's tomb location}}\nGo to any bank ([[Ardougne]] is on the way back up or if you have completed [[Tree Gnome Village]], [[Spirit tree]] to the [[Grand Exchange]] and back). Put all of your [[weapons]], [[armour]] (including capes), [[runes]], [[arrows]] and any type of [[logs]] you may be carrying in the [[bank]] (bring decent food), as you won't be allowed to enter the tomb if you bring them (However, jewellery such as a games necklace, or the graceful outfit may be brought in). Also, remember to put any extra of the Glarial's pebble that you got into the bank in case you die, but remember to keep at least one pebble with you.\n\nGo just south-east of [[Baxtorian Falls]] and just north-west of the [[Fishing Guild]] to find a tombstone. Use the pebble on it to enter, as it will not let you in with weapons, armour, or things used in [[combat]] such as runes or arrows, or any type of [[logs]] (you can drop items at the gravestone and pick them up on your way out). Inside, there are high-level monsters — ignore them or attack a [[skeleton]] or [[Zombie (common)|zombie]] before continuing west to prevent any [[Moss Guardian]] attacking you, as they have a max hit of 14. Doing so is strongly advised for low-level players. The Moss Guardians can potentially one-hit low level players, so it is much better to take smaller amount of damage from the other monsters. Run to the west part of the cave, past the level 84 moss guardians, and search the chest to get [[Glarial's amulet]]. Head to the south part of the cave and search the coffin to get [[Glarial's urn]].\n\n'''{{Colour|red|Warning}}:''' Searching the coffin is an uninterruptible action. You cannot eat or teleport while searching, and can still be attacked by the monsters in the dungeon, which may cause death, particularly if you are a low level or if a Moss Guardian is attacking.\n\n[[File:Glarial's Tomb (scenery).png|thumb|200px|Glarial's tomb containing her urn.]]\nAfter searching the chest and coffin, exit the tomb by going up the ladder. If you're low-levelled you may want to acquire multiple amulets and urns. To get an extra amulet, drop it and search the chest and pick it up again. To get an extra urn, drop it and search the coffin and pick the urn back up. Getting a second amulet is advisable, because it is possible to lose one later on in the quest.\n\n===Baxtorian Treasures===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Rope]], 6 [[Air rune]]s, 6 [[water rune]]s, 6 [[earth rune]]s, [[Glarial's urn]], and [[Glarial's amulet]].''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' [[Games necklace]], [[skills necklace]], [[armour]], [[weapons]], [[food]], [[potions]].''\n\nMake sure the amulet is in your inventory. You may also wish to equip yourself for [[combat]]. Go back to [[Almera]]'s house and board the raft. You will crash again. Use your rope on the large grey rock on the small patch of land just downstream, then use the rope on the dead tree that you can climb. When you reach the doors at the waterfall ledge, go inside.\n[[File:Waterfall Dungeon map.png|thumb|150px|Map of Waterfall Dungeon.]]\nRooms of the Waterfall Dungeon:\n\n#A cavern with level 52 [[shadow spider]]s\n#A room with crates containing [[A key (Waterfall Dungeon)|a key]] needed for the quest and level 16 [[skeleton mage]]s\n#Not used in the quest\n#A cavern with level 86 [[Fire Giant]]s\n#The path to the [[Chalice of Eternity]]\n#A room with the Chalice of Eternity\n\nInside, you'll find level 52 [[shadow spider]]s that drain your [[Prayer]], level 86 [[fire giant]]s, level 45 [[skeleton]]s, and level 16 [[skeleton mage]]s.\n\nTake the eastern passage first, and search the crates for [[A key (Waterfall Dungeon)|a key]]. Then you can take the western passage north. You can attack a shadow spider so that the [[Fire Giant]]s will be unable to attack you (or, potentially, a level 1 rat if enough players are fighting the fire giants further in the cave). (Also you can be likely to find other players training at the [[Fire Giant]]s on more populated servers, making it easier to pass them. It is advisable to move to a server which is populated with people training, as these giants can one-hit a newer player.)\n\n'''Careful:''' If the next portion is incorrectly done you will be washed from the final room. \n\nYou will find six pillars, two statues, and a [[Chalice of Eternity|chalice]] trophy. Use an [[air rune]], a [[water rune]], and an [[earth rune]] on each of the six pillars (meaning three runes total on each pillar). Use [[Glarial's amulet]] on the Statue of Glarial, and then use [[Glarial's urn]] on the Chalice of Eternity. {{Colour|red|Warning}}: ''Complete the dialogue ensuring the urn has been used or you will be flushed. If you do not correctly place the runes on the pillars before putting the amulet on the statue, you will take up to 20 damage.'' Take the reward (note that you must have five free slots to accept it) from the chalice after the ground rises up to it to finish! Be careful, if you forget to put the urn on the Chalice of Eternity, you will be flushed out of the room!\n\n:'''Note:''' If you do get flushed out, or leave, the pillars will remain active. However, you will need to retrieve another amulet to re-enter the dungeon.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Waterfall Quest\n|image = [[File:Waterfall Quest reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = * {{SCP|Strength|13,750}} [[Strength]] experience\n*{{SCP|Attack|13,750}} [[Attack]] experience\n*2 [[Diamond]]s\n*2 [[Gold bar]]s\n*40 [[Mithril seeds]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Waterfall Quest is required for the following:\n*[[Desert Treasure I]]\n*[[Legends' Quest]]\n*[[Medium Kandarin Diary]]\n*[[Roving Elves]]\n*[[The Path of Glouphrie]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 13 January 2021\n|update = God Wars Instancing and Soul Wars Improvements\n|change = Some crates in the Waterfall Quest have been given a stern talking to and will no longer give messages implying that they are actually chests.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Notes==\n*This [[quest]] can be completed at level 3 combat with no skill requirements. However, [[Fire Giants]] and the [[Moss Guardian]] can hit a maximum of 11 and 14 respectively. Completing it will increase your Attack and Strength levels to level 30 (assuming they were previously level 1), and your [[combat level]] to 22.\n*After an update, [[Glarial's amulet]] is no longer required to enter the cave. You can safely discard it after the quest. (Glarial's Amulet is now consumed during the quest)\n*Killing a [[Fire Giant]] in the [[Waterfall Dungeon]] is a requirement of the [[Medium Kandarin Diary]].\n\n{{Waterfall Quest}}"

He tells you that a bunch of [[outlaw]]s have ransacked his trading cart and that he needs you to get back the [[Rat's paper|five papers]] they stole from him. He will give you [[an empty folder]] to keep them in.\n\n{{Map|3122,3473|align=left|width=200|height=200|squareX=16|squareY=11|mtype=rectangle|caption=The outlaws' campsite.}}\nThe outlaws are located between [[Edgeville]] and the [[Grand Exchange]]. You can use a [[Skills necklace]] or [[Ring of wealth]] to travel towards them. Once at the [[Outlaw Camp|camp]], kill five [[outlaw]]s (level 32) to retrieve five of [[Rat's paper]]s, and then use them on the folder to get a [[full folder]].\n\n[[File:What Lies Below - fighting outlaws.png|thumb|250px|Fighting the outlaws in their camp.]]\nReturn to Rat with the folder; he will then ask you to deliver a [[Letter to Surok|letter]] to [[Surok Magis]] in the [[Varrock Palace Library]]. Though written in a [[VPSG code|hard to read font]], the message is in English.\n\nHead to the library, on the north side of the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} of the castle, and speak to Surok Magis. He will destroy the letter and tell you that he can turn plain [[clay]] into [[gold bar]]s! He will need two items, an ordinary [[bowl]] and an [[infused wand]]. He gives you [[Sin'keth's diary]] and a [[Wand (What Lies Below)|wand]] to be infused with chaos.\n\n'''Note:''' If you want to get kudos from the Varrock museum you'll need to get the book [[Dagon'hai History]]. You'll find it in one of the two bookcases furthest east. After the quest you can give the book to the [[Historian Minas]] on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the Varrock museum.\n\n===Chaos Altar===\n{{Needed|[[Wand (What Lies Below)|Wand]]|recommended=A method of [[Varrock teleport]] to quickly return from the altar.}}\nHead to the [[Chaos Altar]], with 15 [[chaos rune]]s in your inventory. Entering the altar requires either a [[chaos talisman]] or [[chaos tiara|tiara]], or access to the [[Abyss]]. There are four ways to reach the altar:\n\n====Option 1====\n{{Needed|[[Chaos talisman]] or [[Chaos tiara|tiara]]}}\n\nFollowing this option avoids the Wilderness entirely but requires 42 mining. Read the [[Sin'keth's diary]], and then go east of [[Varrock]]. Go south-west of the [[Lumberyard]] and west of the [[Earth Altar]]. You should find a [[Statue (Tunnel of Chaos)|statue of Saradomin]]. Talk to [[Anna Jones]], and she will give you a [[bronze pickaxe]]. You must use a bronze pickaxe to excavate the statue (requires 42 mining) to reveal the [[Tunnel of Chaos]] entrance. Enter the tunnel, and you will find that the [[Dagon'hai]] organisation lives there. Head north until you reach a portal. The portal leads to the second level of the Chaos Maze. Climb down a ladder to reach the [[Chaos Altar]].\n\n==== Option 2 ====\n{{Needed|[[Chaos talisman]] or [[Chaos tiara|tiara]]}}\nTravel through the Wilderness ([[Wilderness#Wilderness levels|level 10]]). Head to the [[Chaos Altar]] entrance. Once inside, make your way through the maze to the Chaos Altar.\n[[File:Infusing wand.gif|thumb|150px|Infusing the wand.]]\n\n====Option 3====\nUse the Abyss to travel to the [[Chaos Altar]], which requires completion of the [[Enter the Abyss]] [[miniquest]]. Teleport via the [[Mage of Zamorak]] north of [[Edgeville]] to reach the Abyss. Your prayer will be drained and you will be [[Skull (status)|skulled]]. Make your way past [[Abyssal walker]]s (level 81) into the inner circle, from where you can teleport to the altar.\n\n====Option 4====\nThis option avoids the wilderness. Travel to the [[Chaos Altar]] by entering the [[Guardian of Chaos]] at the [[Temple of the Eye (location)|Temple of the Eye]], which requires completion of the [[Temple of the Eye]] quest. To do this, join a game of [[Guardians of the Rift]] and wait for the Guardian of Chaos to be active, or use a [[Portal talisman (chaos)|Portal Talisman (Chaos)]] to access the Chaos Altar when the Guardian is inactive. This will teleport you close to the altar. To leave, go back through the portal and pass through the barrier at the entrance to Guardians of the Rift.\n\nTo reach the Temple of the Eye, use the [[grouping]] teleport for Guardians of the Rift. Alternatively, use a [[necklace of passage]] to teleport to the Wizards' Tower and enter the portal in the basement.\n\n====Wand====\nWhen you have reached the Chaos Altar, you must ''use'' your [[Wand (What Lies Below)|wand]] on the altar. This will absorb the 15 [[chaos rune]]s to turn the wand into the [[Infused wand]]. Return to the library of [[Varrock]], and talk to [[Surok Magis]] with the infused wand and an empty bowl. He will then give you [[Surok's letter]] for [[Rat Burgiss]]. \n\n'''Note:''' If you take Surok's letter to show [[King Roald]] before Rat Burgiss, you will learn about his guards' skills.\n\n===Ending===\nHead back to [[Rat Burgiss]], and deliver the [[Surok's letter|letter]]. You will need to return to Varrock shortly, so restock on teleport supplies if necessary. Rat Burgiss will explain to you that he is actually the commander of [[Varrock Palace Secret Guard]] and that [[Surok Magis]] is planning on taking over the Kingdom of [[Misthalin]] by using a mind-control spell on [[King Roald]], and that you accidentally helped him with that. Rat Burgiss will direct you to [[Zaff]], owner of the [[Zaff's Superior Staffs!|staff shop]] in [[Varrock]], in order to prepare a spell to counteract Surok's.\n\nTalk to Zaff, who will explain his plan to you. Zaff will give you a [[beacon ring]] and [[Zaff's instructions|instructions]] on how to arrest Surok Magis. You do not need to equip the ring.\n\nGet your gear ready for a fight. Head to Surok Magis (who is now wearing [[Dagon'hai]] robes), and talk to him. He will cast his mind-control spell on [[King Roald]] (level 47), who you will have to fight. When the King has low health, your character will say that ''\"Now would be a good time to summon Zaff!\"''. Now you can ''operate'' the Beacon ring to summon Zaff.\n\nZaff will arrive and saves King Roald by teleporting him away. Then he casts a spell on Surok Magis that permanently seals him in the library. Zaff then casts another spell and the library goes dark. When the light comes back, evidence of the battle is cleaned up and Zaff is gone. '''After this occurs, you will be able to purchase [[Battlestaff|battlestaves]] from [[Zaff's Superior Staffs!|Zaff's Superior Staffs]], in addition to the discounted battlestaves from the [[Varrock Diary]].'''\n\n<gallery>\nWhat Lies Below - Fighting King Roald.png|The player fights King Roald.\nWhat Lies Below - King Roald restored.png|Zaff casts a spell upon his arrival, restoring the King's mind.\nWhat Lies Below - Surok teleblocked.png|Surok attempts to escape, and is stopped by Zaff.\n</gallery>\n\nReturn to [[Rat Burgiss]] to finish the quest.\n\n'''Note:''' If you are a [[One-defence pure|1 defence pure]], it is advised not to skip through the dialogue when speaking to Rat, as [[Defence]] experience would be gained if you proceed to complete the quest.

Players may choose to wait and receive it if they wish to acquire the item.\n\nSpeak to [[Ivy Sophista]] at [[Taverley]] to begin the quest. She is found in the same building that houses the [[crystal chest]].  She will tell you about the danger that [[Lucien]] poses, and thus refers you to [[Thaerisk]], as what he is going to say requires the utmost secrecy. Head up the ladder and talk to Thaerisk, who will continue to talk about [[Lucien]], the evil [[Mahjarrat]] has become even more powerful since acquiring the [[Staff of Armadyl]].\n[[File:While Guthix_Sleeps - fighting_assassins.png|thumb|280px|Fending off assassins with Thaerisk.]]\nAs Thaerisk speaks, the two of you will be attacked by [[Assassin (While Guthix Sleeps)|assassins]] disguised as druids; one will focus on Thaerisk, and the other will attack you. The assassins attack with ranged, and every so often, will yell '''{{overhead|Now!}}''', launching a glowing arrow at the player. Shortly after this arrow lands, the other assassin will say '''{{overhead|Nothing personal, adventurer!}}''' and attack once with a [[Dragon dagger#Special attack|dragon dagger special attack]], which can hit at least 53 damage if not protected against. Swap to [[Protect from Melee]] after the arrow lands, and then focus back on the assassin. You do not have to worry about Thaerisk; he cannot die in this encounter, and his [[Earth Blast]] spells can easily fend off the assassin focused on him.\n\nSpeak with Thaerisk again to learn that many operatives of the [[Crux Eqal]]—followers of [[Guthix]] who play an active part in combating threats to Gielinor— have allied with the [[Guardians of Armadyl]] in response to attacks from Lucien's agents. Thaerisk will reveal that they have reached out to the [[Temple Knights]], believing it necessary to unite followers of different gods to oppose Lucien.\n\nHe will suggest that players look for a researcher named [[Movario]], who he suspects stole the Staff of Armadyl. Their best lead so far is that he hired a member of the Khazard Army named [[Darve]] to act as a bodyguard, and that the [[Fight Arena (location)|Fight Arena]] is a good place to start looking.\n\n==Monitoring Movario==\n===Bravo, Broav!===\n{{Needed|500 [[coins]] or [[ring of Charos(a)]], [[log]], [[knife]]|recommended=[[Ardougne Cloak 1]] or greater, [[Feldip hills teleport]] or Fairy ring access, 1 inventory space for a free [[Mort Myre Fungus]]}}\n[[File:WhileGuthixSleepsLaundererLocation.png|left|thumb|width=150x150|The location of the launderer in the [[Fight Arena (location)|Fight Arena]]]]\nHead to the [[Fight Arena (location)|Fight Arena,]] and speak to the [[Khazard Launderer]] two buildings north of the [[Fight Arena Bar]]. This is just south-west of the [[Ardougne Monastery]] teleport (accessed with the [[Ardougne cloak 1]] or greater). Speak to the launderer regarding Movario. He will be skeptical to give information, so either charm him with the [[ring of Charos(a)]], or bribe him with 500 coins. He will tell you that he doesn't know where Movario lives, but will mention that he does have a [[dirty shirt]] that is too damaged to be washed, and will give the shirt to you. He will also mention that you should speak to the [[hunting expert]] at [[Feldip Hills]] if you want to catch down a [[broav]] of your own to track Movario to his base.\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - trapping a broav.png|thumb|227x227px|A wild broav appeared!]]\nMake your way to the [[Feldip Hunter area]] ([[Feldip hills teleport]] is the quickest method, or [[fairy ring]] code {{fairycode|AKS}}) and seek out the [[hunting expert]] in a wooden building, south-west of the fairy ring. ''Note that the other [[Hunting expert (Red chinchompa hunting ground)|hunting expert]] outside the [[red chinchompa hunting ground]] entrance is '''not''' the correct expert; the Hunter Tutor icon found on the [[minimap]] marks the correct tutor's location.''\n\nAsk her about catching broavs, and she will offer to train one for you if you bring her one. She will provide you with a [[mort myre fungus]] as bait; bring this to the trap west of her location, and set up a [[pitfall trap]] (requiring a knife and logs—logs can be acquired from nearby jungle trees, and an axe can be found right outside the building if the player did not bring one). After setting up the trap, use the fungus on it to bait it, and wait for a [[wild broav]] to appear and fall inside. Once you have an [[unconscious broav]], bring it back to the hunting expert. Be careful not to click too quickly on the trap after the Broav falls in as there is a bug which can create a new trap overwriting the Broav requiring the player to have another set of logs and [[mort myre fungus]]. Ask the hunting expert to train your newly acquired Broav.\n\n===Movario's Base===\n{{Needed|[[Dirty shirt]], [[broav]], 1 [[water rune]], 1 [[fire rune]], 1 [[earth rune]], 1 [[air rune]], 1[[mind rune]], 5 free inventory spaces|recommended=[[Coal bag]], [[log basket]], food}}\n[[File:Broav.gif|thumb|left|161x161px|Using Movario's dirty shirt on the broav.]]\n[[File:WGS puzzle door.png|thumb|Pay attention to the word \"PROHIBITED\" (different for all players) to determine blast colour configuration. ]]\nAfter speaking to the hunting expert, head to the [[battlefield]] and enter to the ruined building near the [[Carnillean Mansion|Carnillean mansion]] ({{Map|type=maplink|x=2519|y=3249|mtype=pin}}). Once here, drop the broav, then use the shirt on it. Follow the broav to a broken table; once the broav squeals, the broken table can be searched, revealing a trapdoor underneath it. Open the trapdoor to enter [[Movario's Base]].\nUpon entering the base, you will be attacked by melee-using [[Elite Khazard Guard]]s as soon as you open the door. When ready, make your way to the north-west area shaped like a hook on the minimap. At the northern end is an open chest; search it to obtain a number of runes. Climb down the stairs, where you find yourself in a room with an [[old battered door]] in the way. ''Note that all teleportation from this point onward is blocked''. Right-click inspect the door, and pay close attention to the word \"PROHIBITED;\" one of the letters is stylised after a [[rune]], which is the rune you must use to open the door. This rune is different for every player.\n\n''Using the incorrect rune on the door will result in an unblockable blast of magic fired at you, dealing 20+ damage. The colour of the blast indicates the correct rune that should have been used.''\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - broav tracking.png|thumb|222x222px|The broav tracking down Movario's scent.]]\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Symbol\n!Letter\n!Rune\n!Blast colour\n|-\n| [[File:Old battered door - stylised O (mind).png|link=]]\n| O\n| {{plinkp|Mind rune}}\n| Purple\n|-\n| [[File:Old battered door - stylised H (earth).png|link=]]\n| H\n| {{plinkp|Earth rune}}\n| Green \n|-\n| [[File:Old battered door - stylised E (air).png|link=]]\n| E\n| {{plinkp|Air rune}}\n| White\n|-\n| [[File:Old battered door - stylised E (fire).png|link=]]\n| E\n| {{plinkp|Fire rune}}\n| Red\n|-\n| [[File:Old battered door - stylised D (water).png|link=]]\n| D\n| {{plinkp|Water rune}}\n| Blue\n|}\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - wired floors.png|thumb|250px|A room full of bookcases with wires running between them.]]\nUpon using the correct rune, proceed through the door. Note that you cannot enter if you weigh less than 2 kg, so unequip any [[weight-reducing clothing]] you may be wearing before moving forward.\n\nAs you enter the room, a section of floor will sink slightly under your weight. In this room, filled with bookcases with wires running between them, the objective is to open the caged door by diverting power from the gates to the wires. Begin by searching the bookcases until the [[chatbox]] indicates that you hear a click as you pull a lever. From that initial bookcase, follow the floor wires that illuminate and search the subsequent bookcase, continuing to do so until the chatbox indicates that the electric gate is deactivated. This message indicates the gate can now be safely opened. Enter the gate, and then '''search''' the spiral staircase and disable the trap, then climb it to access Movario's study.\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - Movario's study.png|thumb|250px|A player in Movario's study.]]\nIn the study, search the desk to obtain [[Movario's notes (volume 1)]], and click through all pages. Next, pick up the [[waste-paper basket]] next to the desk, and search it for a [[Ruby key (While Guthix Sleeps)|ruby key]]. Use this key on the northernmost bookcase to the west to access a rising staircase; this has no traps, so proceed upstairs.\n\n'''Search''' the bed to uncover a bed chest beneath it, then use the ruby key on the chest to unlock it. Right-click \"search\" the bed chest (choosing \"Open\" will trigger a trap dealing 18+ damage). Then, open the chest and search the open chest for [[Movario's notes (volume 2)]]. Read it, and do not discard them, as you must give them to Thaerisk later on.\n\n===Weight and see===\nHead back downstairs to the study. At the southern side of the room, inspect the painting on the wall and pull the lever to reveal an entrance to a hidden room. Cross over the broken wall, then search the drawers to obtain some [[notes on pressure]]. Read it, then look at the pressure gauge, which displays a number in the unit of \"tickits;\" this value represents the sum of the weight of the statue, as well as that of any objects on top of it. Exiting the room requires the pressure gauge to read the same value as the weight indicated in your [[Equipment Stats]] interface.\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - hidden room in study.png|thumb|280px|The hidden room beyond the painting in Movario's study.]]\n\nIf your mass is different than the value of tickits indicated by the pressure gauge, you must do one of two things. Both require you to take weights from the pile of weights nearby, where there are three sizes available: [[Weight (1kg)|1kg]], [[Weight (2kg)|2kg]], and [[Weight (5kg)|5kg]].\n* If your mass is '''lower''' than the value from the pressure gauge you must '''take''' enough weights from the pile to increase your weights to match the pressure gauge's value.\n* If your mass is '''higher''', you must take enough weights from the pile and '''put them on the statue''' to the north.\n\nFor example, if you weigh 41 kg, and the pressure gauge reads 11 tickits, you must put 30 kg on the statue (11 + 30 = 41). If you weigh 29 kg and the pressure gauge reads 31 tickits, you must pick up 2 kg from the weight pile and keep it in your inventory (31 - 29 = 2).\n\nOnce your weight and the reading on the pressure gauge are equal, the eastern door will unlock, allowing you to leave via teleportation.\n\nIf you made a mistake, a small contraption by the door will count down from three, indicating the amount of tries the player has before triggering a trap. If the contraption counts down to zero, it will spray gas and throw the player into a jail room, confiscating Movario's notes. Players may simply retrace their steps to get them back.\n\n'''Note:''' While not necessary for quest completion, there is a tunnel in the south-west corner of the study. Entering the tunnel brings you to a room where you can loot 100 [[death runes]], 100 [[fire runes]], 100 [[coal]], and 100 [[magic logs]]. The fastest way to leave with the resources is to attempt to open the eastern door with the wrong weight on the scale, in order to be kicked out of the base. Note that the coal and magic logs are looted in unnoted form, so bringing a [[coal bag]] and [[log basket]] will be advantageous for those seeking to reduce trips back and forth. Movario's notes will still be confiscated even if they are in the bank, so it is advised to hand them in to Thaerisk first before going back and looting the base.\n\n==Forming a fellowship==\n{{Needed|[[Movario's notes (volume 1)]], [[Movario's notes (volume 2)]], [[lantern lens]], 20 coins for pink dye from Betty, a [[snapdragon seed]] (Thaerisk provides one for free), [[seed dibber]] (if the player hasn't completed the Farming part of Barbarian Training), runes to cast the NPC Contact spell four times (8 air runes, 4 astral runes, 4 cosmic runes)|recommended=Combat equipment, fairy ring access, [[Taverley teleport]], multiple teleports to [[Falador]], a teleport to the [[Warrior's Guild]] ([[Strength Cape]], [[Combat bracelet]] or [[Games necklace]])}}\n\n===The Mahjarrat's mercenaries===\nHead back to Thaerisk at Taverley and show him the notes you stole from Movario's Base. He will then tell you that in your absence, the Crux Eqal have managed to secure the Temple Knights as allies, and that a base of operations is being established at the [[White Knights' Castle]]. Additionally, they have lost contact with [[Idria]] and the [[Guardians of Armadyl]]; as such, Thaerisk will ask that you head to [[McGrubor's Wood]] to check up on them.\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - fighting mercenaries.png|thumb|280px|Fending off Lucien's mercenaries.]]\nThe quickest way to reach McGrubor's Wood is via [[fairy ring]] (code {{fairycode|ALS}}). Once there, head to the building by way of the [[loose railing (McGrubor's Wood)|loose railing]] to the east, where a cutscene begins in which Lucien's mercenaries will attack the Guardians of Armadyl. Kill the two [[mercenary axeman|mercenary axemen]], then finish off the [[mercenary mage]]; when the mage teleports away at low health, you can proceed to speak to Idria, whom you will inform of the Crux Eqal moving their base of operations to the White Knights' Castle. Alternatively, wait for Idria to kill all of them.\n\n===Telling the truth===\nHead to the Falador castle and head to the round table on the ground floor east side, where you will meet [[Akrisae]] along with Thaerisk and Idria. Despite their differing beliefs, they agree that Lucien poses a threat and that they all must work together to stop him. Based on Movario's notes, they will conclude that he is looking for the [[Stone of Jas]], an extremely powerful artefact of ancient origin. They will add that the spies Lucien sent to monitor Movario could be captured for interrogation, and that they have an improved version of a truth serum to use on them. Akrisae will give you a [[teleorb]] that you must plant on a spy, which will then teleport the spy into the jail cell once the corresponding teleport spell is cast.\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - interrogation.png|thumb|280px|Thaerisk instructs a druid to serve the spy some \"juice\".]]\nIn [[Draynor Village]], you will find a number of [[shady stranger]]s and [[suspicious outsider]]s. Use the teleorb on any of them. '''Make sure to avoid talking to the stranger first, as you may be unable to plant the orb on them for some time.''' Note that it is possible to fail, causing you to take a small amount of damage. Once you've succeeded, make your way back to White Knights' Castle and speak to Akrisae, who will forcefully teleport the spy into the cell.\n\nA cutscene will play in which a druid attempts to coax the spy into drinking the truth serum, but the spy will kick them, knocking him out and breaking the \"juice.\" You will now need to make another one on behalf of Thaerisk, who tells you that the enhanced serum uses an [[enriched snapdragon]], directs you to [[Betty]] in [[Port Sarim]], and offers a teleport to get there.\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - enriching snapdragon seed.png|thumb|280px|Enriching the snapdragon seed at Betty's shop.]]\nBefore being teleported, make sure you have a [[lantern lens]] and 20 coins. Thaerisk will also give the player a free snapdragon seed if they choose to take it.\n\nWhen ready, accept Thaerisk's teleport. Talk to Betty and purchase the [[pink dye]] from her, then use it on the lantern lens to obtain a [[rose-tinted lens]]. Next, speak to her again, asking about enriching snapdragon seeds. She will realise you are working with Thaerisk, since she is aware only he would need it, but willing to help nonetheless.\n\nTo enrich the seed, the player needs to use the tinted lens on the shop counter whilst standing at the doorway. Pick up the [[enriched snapdragon seed]] and return to Thaerisk in the [[White Knights' Castle]].\n\n===Amassing the masters===\nWith the seed in tow, Thaerisk will instruct you to plant the enriched seed in a special patch on top of the castle. Climb up the '''western stairs''' to the top of the castle (three floors up), then plant the seed in the patch (the seed cannot become diseased). As the herb grows, speak to Idria, who will ask that you assemble a small task force to take on Lucien alongside you, all of which can be recruited via [[NPC Contact]]:\n* [[Turael]] - in [[Burthorpe]]\n* [[Mazchna]] - in [[Canifis]]\n* [[Duradel]] - in [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]], reached by climbing the ladder in the fishing shop.\n* [[Cyrisus]] - cast [[NPC Contact]] and select him in the interface\n\nThe player can visit each master in person, but it is recommended to use [[NPC Contact]] instead, since [[Cyrisus]] requires the spell to be contacted anyway. Talk to them about Lucien, and they will agree to help.\n\nOnce all four heroes are recruited, the herb will have finished growing, so return to the patch and harvest an [[enriched snapdragon]]. Head back down to Thaerisk, who he will give you a regular [[Truth serum (While Guthix Sleeps)|truth serum]]; use the enriched snapdragon on it to create the [[super truth serum]].\n\nIf you don't already have a [[charcoal]] and [[papyrus]], they can be obtained in the drawers just south of the jail cell next to the Suit of Armour. With the super truth serum, go inside the jail cell. The stranger will refuse to talk, so you will threaten him instead, causing him to quickly comply and consume the serum. He will reveal that he takes orders from a man named the [[Dark Squall]], and then describe Squall's appearance. You will automatically make a [[suspect sketch]].\n\nGive the sketch to Idria, who will tell you that she will get them copied for wanted posters and passed around to the Temple Knight's spies. In the meantime, she will ask that you recruit [[Ghommal]], [[Harrallak Menarous]], and [[Sloane]], who can all be found in the [[Warriors' Guild]]. Ghommal and Harrallak can be found right by the guild's entrance, whilst Sloane can be found one floor above. \n\nReturn to Akrisae, who has potential new developments regarding the [[Dark Squall]]. However, the group is interrupted by the appearance of [[Hazelmere]], who will reveal to you that the vision he told you about refers to [[Lucien]], and offers his assistance.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - alliance in Falador.png|The alliance headquartered within White Knights' Castle.\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - Hazelmere appears.png|Hazelmere arrives to offer his assistance to the alliance.\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - gathered heroes.png|The band of heroes, gathered together within White Knights' Castle.\n</gallery>\n\n==The Dark Squall==\n{{Needed|9 free inventory spaces, [[bronze med helm]] and [[iron chainbody]] (or a [[black armour set]]), an [[unpowered orb]] and runes for any [[charge orb]] spell ([[standard spellbook]] is required), and combat equipment for two combat styles (magic recommended)|recommended=[[Emergency teleport]], [[stamina potion]], [[prayer potion]], food}}\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - Black Knight Catacombs map.png|thumb|250px|A map of the Black Knight Catacombs.]]\nSpeak to Akrisae, who tells you that the Dark Squall has been spotted near the [[Black Knights' Fortress (location)|Black Knights' Fortress]]. Akrisae sent his operative [[Silif]] to scout the area, whose last report is that he had entered the fortress and presumably followed Dark Squall inside. You will be asked to investigate this further in case Silif is in trouble.\n\nEnter the fortress with your disguise of choice, then push the hidden wall directly ahead and climb down the ladder. Head south towards the tiled flooring, and inspect the green carved tile with an orb symbol on it. Cast any charged orb spell on it, and it will transform into a trapdoor; climb down to enter the [[Black Knight Catacombs]].\n\nThe Catacombs is full of elite [[Kinshra]] in the form of [[Elite Black Knight]]s, [[Elite Dark Warrior]]s, [[Elite Dark Mage]]s, and [[Elite Dark Ranger]]s. They are all '''aggressive''' unless the player is wearing [[elite black armour]] or the [[Dark Squall robes]], and utilise protection prayers when fought. While this is not unlimited, it is still recommended to bring at least two combat styles to have maximum uptime while fighting them.\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - killing elite black knight.png|thumb|left|220px|Players can safely kill elite black knights just past the broken bridge with Protect from Melee.]]\nAfter passing the broken bridge, you will be surrounded by elite dark warriors and one elite black knight, allowing you to pray [[Protect from Melee]] without any mages and rangers attacking. Kill the elite black knight here until you have a full set of [[elite black armour]]. \n\nMaking sure to wear the armour beforehand, make your way north-east and climb up the wall. Run all the way north-west to a set of doors.\n\n'''Recommended:''' Enter the western door to unlock a shortcut within the catacombs. \n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - inner base labels.png|thumb|400px|The locations of various objects in the Dark Squall's inner base.]]With 9 free inventory spaces, enter the northern door and search: '''1 Desk, 1 Key Rack, 2 Tables, 2 Wardrobes''' \n\nfor the items required for Silif's rescue: \n\na second set of [[elite black armour]], the [[cell key]], the [[Lobster]] and [[restore potion]], the [[Dark Squall robes]]. The robes will be used as your disguise from here on out. \n\nIf you have an additional three inventory spaces, take the [[strange teleorb]] alongside the [[Death rune|death]] and [[law rune]]; otherwise, you can take them later. Head back out through the southern door, then use the nearest eastern path to reach the jail cells, where you will find Silif in the northernmost cell. Open the gate, then use the lobster (or other food item if you lost the lobster since looting it) and restore potion on him to help him recover. Talk to him again and ask if he has a plan, and he will tell you that he needs to access the inner base to view the Dark Squall's maps and plans, which he can memorise and duplicate once he leaves. You will automatically give him the second set of elite black armour at the end of this dialogue, and he will begin to follow you.\n\nReturn to the room with the desks and wardrobes, and lead Silif to the map board by the southern wall. While he studies the maps, he will ask that you find the [[Dark Squall]] and plant a [[teleorb]] on him. It is recommended that players now bank and regear appropriately, as there will be a magic-based boss fight coming up, explained below.\n\n===Scuffle with Surok===\n{{Needed| One free inventory slot (to pick up lit explosive), [[Dark Squall's robes]], [[teleorb]], food, combat equipment for [[standard magic]] ([[powered staves]] will '''not''' work), and runes for the following spells: multiple casts of all four elemental spells, [[Snare]]/[[Entangle]], [[Weaken]]/[[Enfeeble]], [[Telekinetic Grab]], and [[Low Level Alchemy|Low]]/[[High Level Alchemy]]; as such, you will need Air, Water, Earth, Fire, Body/Soul, Nature, Law, and your choice of [[catalytic runes]]).}}\n\nMake your way back to the inner base, and attempt to climb the ladder on the eastern side of the room. An Elite Black Knight will stop you, but your disguised self will fool him, scolding him for his incompetence and ordering him to do push-ups. A cutscene will then ensue where you stumble into the real [[Dark Squall]]. He will be revealed to be [[Surok Magis]], who escaped during the chaos in [[Defender of Varrock]].\n\nSurok has 450 hitpoints, attacks with [[Fire Surge]], and has both [[Protect from Melee]] and [[Protect from Missiles]] simultaneously active. It is therefore necessary to attack with magic. Pray [[Protect from Magic]], as his attacks can hit over 40 without it, but significantly less with the prayer active. Surok is notably immune to damage from [[powered staff|powered staves]], thus the player must use combat spells in order to damage him. He is also immune to the sapping effects caused by [[blood spells]]. It is highly recommended to use the [[standard spellbook]] and cast the best elemental spell possible, as Surok's mechanics necessitate the use of the spellbook to counter them.\n\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - fighting Surok.png|thumb|280px|The player fights Surok Magis, leader of the Dagon'hai.]]\nEvery 7-8 attacks, Surok will launch a special attack:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Quote\n!Attack\n|-\n|{{overhead|Fighting you is beneath me!}}\n|Surok will call in either a [[Strong Warrior]] or [[Agile Warrior]] and begin to approach you. The player will always deal no damage to them unless casting counter spells beforehand. These spells are [[Weaken]] for the Strong Warrior and any [[Stun (status)|binding spell]], such as [[Entangle]], for the Agile Warrior before they can be damaged.\n\nIf the warriors are not killed before they reach you, you will be bound and Surok will cast a spell that deals 45+ damage while also killing the warrior in the process. \n|-\n|{{overhead|Magicus ignitus!}}\n|Surok will throw out a [[lit explosive]], which will deal 45+ damage if ignored or picked up. Quickly cast [[Telekinetic Grab]] on it, then alchemise it to safely avoid the explosion. (If you use the plug-in \"No Bad Alchs\" turn it off before the fight)\n|-\n|{{overhead|Witness true sorcery!}}\n|Surok will cast 1-4 elemental surges that approach slowly towards you, dealing 45+ damage per surge unless countered. The lower Surok's health, the more surges he casts.\n\nThey can be countered by casting any offensive spell of the opposite element on the elemental surges (not Surok himself). Air and earth are opposites, as are water and fire.\n\nThe [[Twinflame staff]]'s passive effect does NOT work against this attack, spells will still need to be cast manually\n|}\n\nIf you die, your gravestone will be in the tunnels with the elite black knights and collecting your items will be risky without the disguises. The Dark Squall Robes are always kept on death, so be certain to bring them to reclaim your items.\n\nAfter defeating Surok, he will fall to the floor. Use the teleorb on him, then return to White Knights' Castle.\n\n===Wrath of Lucien===\n{{Needed|Dark Squall's robes, [[Strange teleorb]], 1 [[death rune]], 1 [[law rune]]|recommended=Teleport to Falador}}\n\nSpeak to Akrisae, and you will report back on your exploits in the catacombs. He will tell you that with Silif's help, they have managed to locate [[Lucien]]'s base at the western edge of the [[Wilderness]], and that the heroes will move in once you have visual on Lucien. Your next task is to impersonate Surok, who they believe can contact Lucien directly. Using the robes you stole from Surok's inner base, you will now switch places with him to find a way to access Lucien's base directly.\n\nWhen ready, walk into the jail cell, and Akrisae will teleport you back into Surok's inner base. If you didn't take the [[strange teleorb]] (and the runes required to use it) from the desks, climb back down and do so. Otherwise, activate it whilst standing in the magical circle to teleport into [[Lucien's camp]].\n\nThe camp is inhabited by numerous level 128 [[Skeleton (Lucien's camp)|skeletons]] and [[Undead Mage]]s, though they will not be aggressive if the player is still wearing [[Surok's robes]]. Run along the north-east path until you are across from the [[Chaos Temple (hut)|Chaos Temple]], then climb up the [[ice wall]] to the east and jump to the [[Ledge (Chaos Temple)|ledge]] on the [[Chaos Temple (hut)|Chaos Temple]] (this is a safe area and does not count as being in the [[Wilderness]]).\n\nSkip reading to the next section if you want to avoid spoilers for this cutscene.\n\nA cutscene will play showing Lucien, now with the Staff of Armadyl, casting a powerful spell to raise [[Undead Hero]]es for his army. He will then notice you, see through your disguise, and cast a powerful spell at you. The first shot will miss, and you will jump away from the second shot, which instead incinerates two elite black knights that are attempting to apprehend you. Seeing you in danger, Hazelmere will call on the band of heroes to teleport to the chapel and engage Lucien.\n\n[[Mazchna]] and [[Harrallak]] will draw the undead heroes, while everyone else will engage Lucien. [[Sloane]] and [[Duradel]] will be instantly killed when they attempt to face Lucien, and [[Hazelmere]] will cast a barrage of crystalline spikes towards him, all to no avail. [[Cyrisus]], [[Ghommal]], and [[Turael]], after killing their respective enemies, also join in on the attack, but fail to deal any damage. Lucien will then cast another attack, instantly killing the three warriors.\n\nWhile Hazelmere is given the chance to escape with the seeds he used earlier to [[The Path of Glouphrie|save you]], he will choose to accept his fate and perish to the same attack. Satisfied with the devastation, Lucien will then teleport away, forcing Mazchna and Harrallak to retreat back to Falador. Head back to White Knights' Castle. Teleports will work while above the [[Chaos Temple (hut)|Chaos Temple]].\n[[File:Wrath of Lucien.mp4|thumb|centre|600px|The full cutscene of Lucien's slaughter.]]\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - Lucien and his undead heroes.png|Lucien and his army of undead heroes.\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - Lucien spots the player.png|Lucien spots the player, and fires a powerful spell towards you.\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - band of heroes.png|The band of heroes, led by Hazelmere, make haste to your location.\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - the heroes arrive.png|The heroes arrive not a moment sooner.\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - Lucien kills Duradel and Sloane.png|Lucien kills Duradel and Sloane.\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - Lucien kills Cyrisus, Turael, and Ghommal.png|Lucien kills Cyrisus, Turael, and Ghommal.\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - Hazelmere's death.png|The wise and mighty Hazelmere, moments before being reduced to ashes.\n</gallery>\n\n==Into the Chasm==\n{{Needed|Dark Squall's robes, a '''lit''' [[sapphire lantern]], sufficient prayer points to cast [[Bloom]]|recommended=Some means of reaching the [[Chasm of Tears]] (ex. a [[games necklace]]), 8 filled [[druid pouch]]es or 3 [[mort myre fungus]] to refill it, 7 empty inventory slots. A [[Spade]], [[Hammer]], and [[Chisel]] (all can be acquired in immediate proximity of the quest).}}\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - Movario in the chasm.png|thumb|280px|Movario continues his search in the Chasm of Tears.]]\n[[File:Chasm-X.png|thumb|Rock Bottom Orb Locations]]\nSpeak to either Idria, Akrisae, or Thaerisk, who apologise for severely underestimating Lucien's strength. Akrisae will then report that [[Movario]] has been spotted entering the [[Chasm of Tears]], and is likely hot on the trail for the Stone; you will be asked to impersonate Surok and head there to help him with his investigations. Use the games necklace to teleport to Tears of Guthix, then head north (past the minigame) and climb the rocks to reach Movario.\n\nUpon speaking to him as Surok, he will tell you that he believes the Stone is at the bottom of the chasm. Though he lacks the means to climb all the way down the deep chasm, you will reveal the [[light creature]]s are capable of doing so with a [[sapphire lantern]], and he will use a light blue spell to draw the creature down into the chasm with you in tow. Click on a [[light creature]] to attract it.\n\n===Rock bottom===\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - extracting blocks.png|thumb|280px|Extracting elemental blocks from the recesses.]]\nUpon arriving at the bottom of the chasm, you will find yourself on the north-east area of an X-shaped platform. \n\nSearch the nearby [[skeletal remains]] for the following items: a [[spade]], a [[hammer]], and a [[chisel]]. \n\n* On the north-east area, use the spade on the pile of rocks next to the skeleton to uncover a brazier, then use the chisel on it to obtain a [[fire orb]]. \n* Go west to the north-west area and do the same to the lone pile of rocks for an [[earth orb]]. \n* Go south to the south-west area, and use a chisel on the intact brazier there for an [[air orb]].\n* Go east to the south-east area, use a chisel on the brazier there for the [[water orb]].\n\n=== Trading Orbs For Blocks, Blocks for Access ===\nHead all the way south to reach the walls shaped as skulls. \n\n* For each skull, examine (or camera zoom) the recess to identify an elemental marking. Use the corresponding element orb on a recess to exchange for an elemental block.   \n** ''The 3 lower-level recesses will be randomized for players, but the recess for [[water block]] is located 2 levels above the centre skull, and requires climbing to access. This recess appears different but behaves the same.''\n\n* With all elemental blocks acquired, Unequip your weapon and shield slots and enter all 3 of the lower-level skull nose cavities. \n* Crawl to the end, examine (or camera zoom) the mechanism to identify the mechanism's element, and use the corresponding elemental block on each mechanism. \n** ''The 3 lower-level mechanisms will be randomized for players, but the [[fire block]] will be used on the top floor.''\n\n* Climb back up to the fourth skull (where you received the [[water block]]) and use the [[fire block]] on the recessed block.\n* Inspect the stone cube, and the recessed block will vanish to reveal an entrance.\n* Climb through to reach the Ancient Guthixian Temple.\n\n===Dolmens, doors, and druids===\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - statues with dolmens.png|thumb|280px|Placing ingredients in exchange for dolmen]]The stone table is surrounded by multiple forked paths leading to 8 of 13 possible [[Statue (Ancient Guthixian Temple)|statues]], each named after potions. Statue selection and locations are randomized uniquely per player.\n\n* Make your way south to the central chamber where the stone table is found.\n* Search the nearby skeleton for a [[silver sickle (b)]] and a [[druid pouch|druid pouch(6)]].\n* You will need between 2 and 18 free inventory spaces. Drop your [[spade]], [[chisel]], and [[hammer]], re-equip any available item slots to free up inventory.\n** To use the bare minimum inventory space (2), you will need to scout each tunnel to identify each statue.\n** To minimise time running, you will loot all supplies simultaneously (16-18) before visiting each statue.\n* Inspect the Green brazier between the table and north entrance for '''free stamina doses''', and return for more. \n** ''This brazier does not have a click limit, and will activate the [[ring of endurance]] effect and consuming charges if it is equipped.''\n\n==== Acquiring Ingredients ====\nNote that the druids will always drop exactly what is needed to solve all eight puzzles, so there is no risk of receiving unnecessary items or duplicates.\n\n* Use a charged druid pouch on [[druid spirit]]<nowiki/>s, they will drop one exact set of ingredients you need.\nIngredients are only dropped once, and no unnecessary items are dropped. If you fail to pick them up, you will need to leave and return with your own.\n* If you have at least 2 more inventory spaces, rinse and repeat until you have either a full inventory or all 16 supplies needed.\n\n====== Recharging Pouches ======\nWith eight spirits required to be freed and six druid pouch charges provided, the player will need to make two additional charges to obtain all the items needed to solve the puzzles.\n\n* With the [[silver sickle (b)]] and a [[druid pouch]] in your inventory, stand over one of the dead vines scattered all over the tunnels.\n* Right-click cast bloom on the [[silver sickle (b)]], and pick the [[Vine flower]]<nowiki/>s which spawn.\n* With 3+ [[Vine flower]]<nowiki/>s in your inventory, right-click fill your druid pouch.\n\n====== Acquiring Dolmens ======\n\n* Once you have one or multiple sets of ingredients, find the statue that corresponds to your ingredients.\n* Use the two correct ingredients on the statue.\n* Upon using the second ingredient, the statue will animate and you will receive a Dolmen.\n* If you have no more ingredients, return to the table and use your dolmen on the table.\n* If you have more ingredients, continue visiting the statues.\n\nExamine the statues and use the corresponding ingredients on them:\n{| class=\"wikitable lighttable\" style=\"max-width: 1000px\"\n|+\n! width=\"100\" | Keyword\n!Ingredients\n|-\n|Agility||{{plink|Toadflax}} + {{Plink|Toad's legs}}\n|-\n|Attacking||{{plink|Guam leaf}} + {{plink|Eye of newt}} '''or''' {{plink|Irit leaf}} + {{plink|Eye of newt}}\n|-\n|Balance||{{plink|Harralander}} + {{plink|Red spiders' eggs}} + {{plink|Garlic}} + {{plink|Silver dust}}\n|-\n|Combat||{{plink|Harralander}} + {{plink|Goat horn dust}}\n|-\n|Defence||{{plink|Ranarr weed}} + {{plink|White berries}} '''or''' {{plink|Cadantine}} + {{plink|White berries}}\n|-\n|Energy||{{plink|Avantoe}} + {{plink|Mort myre fungus}} '''or''' {{plink|Harralander}} + {{plink|Chocolate dust}}\n|-\n|Fishing||{{plink|Avantoe}} + {{plink|Snape grass}}\n|-\n|Hunting||{{plink|Avantoe}} + {{plink|Kebbit teeth dust}}\n|-\n|Magic||{{plink|Lantadyme}} + {{plink|Potato cactus}}\n|-\n|Prayer||{{plink|Ranarr weed}} + {{plink|Snape grass}}\n|-\n|Ranging||{{plink|Dwarf weed}} + {{plink|Wine of zamorak}}\n|-\n|Restoration||{{plink|Snapdragon}} + {{plink|Red spiders' eggs}} '''or''' {{plink|Harralander}} + {{plink|Red spiders' eggs}}\n|-\n|Strength||{{plink|Tarromin}} + {{plink|Limpwurt root}} '''or''' {{plink|Kwuarm}} + {{plink|Limpwurt root}}\n|}\n\n* Upon using the final dolmen on the stone table, the huge door will be opened.\n\n* Bank and gear up for the fight in the next section, as there is a particularly hard boss fight coming up which necessitates the use of supplies and multiple combat styles. \n** ''The player will no longer need the dark squall's robes at this point.''\n\n==The Stone of Jas==\n{{Needed|[[Sapphire lantern]], combat equipment for three attack styles.|recommended=[[Super restore]] potions, [[Menaphite remedy]], [[Book of the dead]] and runes for thralls}}\n\nPlayers will need to prepare for a difficult fight ahead, requiring equipment for all three attack styles, and a means to restore drained stats. '''Bringing only two attack styles will result in the elemental praying against both your attack styles in the final phase.'''\n\n===Balancing act===\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - Balance Elemental coalesces.mp4|thumb|left|220px|The Balance Elemental takes form.]]\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - the Balance Elemental.png|thumb|280px|The Stone's guardian, the Balance Elemental, appears before you.]]\nWhen ready, head beyond the huge door and run through the corridor until a cutscene begins. As you discover that the [[Stone of Jas]] is indeed here, energy begins to coalesce into the [[Balance Elemental]], the Stone's guardian. You will tell it that [[Lucien]] is coming to take the Stone; while the elemental believes you, it still has a task to fulfil and will attack the player.\n\nThe Balance Elemental has 750 hitpoints and attacks with all three combat styles. It changes styles after four attacks, then uses a special attack that drains both combat stats and a large chunk of prayer, before repeating another four attacks. The first of the four attacks will always be a stat-lowering attack using its new combat style before attacking again normally. It also makes use of advanced pathing to avoid being [[safespot|safe-spotted]] in its melee form. The standard attacks have a max hit of 40, while the special attack can hit up to 89.\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - fighting the Balance Elemental.png|thumb|280px|The Balance Elemental fights the player.]]\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - Hiding from the Balance Elemental.png|thumb|280px|A possible tile to hide from the Balance Elemental.]]\nThe appearance of its head determines its primary combat style. '''Immediately''' switch prayers upon the elemental changing appearance to avoid taking heavy and rapid damage; when done correctly, this mitigates most of the damage dealt. The correct overhead prayer must be active before it begins the animation for the drain attack to negate it. There are approximately 2 ticks to react to the new attack style before damage is taken. Do not be fooled by the animation resembling a projectile — if the Elemental's head is white, it is still a melee attack.\n\nAfter reaching certain Hitpoint thresholds, it will begin to speed up its attacks and use protection prayers. The Elemental will not switch protection prayers until you deal a certain amount of damage to it.\n\nBringing a [[Menaphite remedy]] and running behind the pillars to hide from the elemental if a prayer swap is missed is an effective way to restore drained stats.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Appearance\n!Image\n!Attack style\n!Prays against (<550 HP)\n|-\n|Fiery / Orange\n|[[File:Balance Elemental.png|center|100px]]\n|Ranged\n|[[File:Protect from Melee overhead.png|center|link=]]\n|-\n|Airy / White\n|[[File:Balance Elemental (melee).png|center|80px]]\n|Melee\n|[[File:Protect from Magic overhead.png|center|link=]]\n|-\n|Watery / Azure\n|[[File:Balance Elemental (magic).png|center|80px]]\n|Magic\n|[[File:Protect from Missiles overhead.png|center|link=]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Health\n!Attack speed\n!Mechanics\n|-\n|<750\n|6\n|Standard attacks\n|-\n|<550\n|5\n|Standard attacks plus one protection prayers (see table above)\n|-\n|<200\n|2\n|Standard attacks plus two protection prayers\n|}\n\nPlayers should be careful not to get overwhelmed by the fast attack speed and focus on correct Prayer and equipment switches. If you do find yourself getting overwhelmed, an option is to immediately run to the other side of the Stone of Jas when the fight starts, where the player is safe from attacks. After this, attack the Balance Elemental until it changes its attack style. When its attack style changes, quickly change your overhead Prayer accordingly and run back behind the Stone to sort out the rest. This will give you more time to set up everything for the next couple of attacks until the Balance Elemental switches attack styles again. \n\nIf you die, your gravestone will be placed by [[Movario]] and [[Darve]] in the Chasm of Tears; you will '''not''' need another [[sapphire lantern]] to retrieve your items, but you will need it to return to to the bottom.\n\n===Facing your demons===\nOnce the elemental is killed, touch the Stone of Jas. This will cause the player to relive memories of the past with other stone-users, such as [[V]]. Movario and Darve will appear, thanking you for bringing them to the Stone of Jas. Suddenly, Lucien will teleport in and ask Movario why he did not inform him of the discovery, who defends himself by stating that he had just discovered it. Noticing the player, he proceeds to take the Stone of Jas before summoning two [[Tormented Demon]]s to attack the player. Idria and the Guardians of Armadyl will then teleport in to assist.\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - the Stone's vision.mp4|thumb|centre|600px|The vision from the Stone of Jas.]]\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - V touches the Stone.png|V touching the Stone of Jas.\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - 4th Age Heroes and the Stone.png|A vision depicting the heroes of the [[Dragonkin Conflicts]] with the Stone.\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - Lucien and the Stone.png|Lucien appears to take the Stone.\nWhile Guthix Sleeps - fighting tormented demons.png|The Guardians of Armadyl come to your aid.\n</gallery>\n[[File:While Guthix Sleeps - Lucien takes the Stone.mp4|thumb|350px|Lucien teleports the stone away, and summons two tormented demons to finish you off.]]\nThe player's stats are temporarily increased to 255 due to touching the Stone of Jas, and stat drains (such as [[saradomin brew]]s) will not affect the player. Kill off the two tormented demons, fighting them one at a time. The demons have a fire shield which reduces damage slightly, and can occasionally bind the player before launching fire projectiles around them which can be avoided by walking away from the targeted tiles, though the Stone of Jas' power means that the player will not have much issue dealing massive damage to them. The demons, like the elemental, make use of advanced pathing and can hit quite high if their attacks are not protected against.\n\nIf trying to avoid combat XP, you may hide behind the south-western column; the Guardians of Armadyl are capable of defeating the tormented demons without the player's assistance. This can take upwards of 10 minutes, and logging out will reset the fight, so make sure to not get logged out for idling if trying this. If you are simply low on supplies from fighting the Balance Elemental, it is faster to teleport out to restock, as the fight will reset to when the tormented demons spawned and you will not need to fight the Balance Elemental again.\n\nAfter killing off the demons, Idria will be amazed at the strength you acquired from touching the Stone of Jas and will offer to teleport you back to the White Knights' Castle. Accept, and speak to the group, who will be dismayed that Lucien now has the Stone of Jas in his possession.

Though the quest is largely the same as the original, numerous changes were made to the lore, graphics, gameplay, music, and rewards.\n\n==Developers==\n'''Original:'''\n* '''Developer:''' Mod Tytn\n* '''Lead Design Editor:''' Mod Mark\n* '''Second Developers:'''\t[[Paul Gower]], John H\n* '''Assistant Developers:''' Mod Liono, Mod Tim, Mod Newmatic, [[Mod Maz]]\n* '''Additional Writing:'''\tMod John A, Luke M, Mod Rowley\n* '''Technical Support:''' [[Mod Ash]], Mod Benny, Mod Chihiro\n* '''Code Review:''' Mod John A, Mod Roderick, Mod Newmatic\n* '''Lead Graphics Artist:''' James W\n* '''Graphics:''' Matthew S, Mod Brass, Mod Alex, Matthew M, Mod Paul B, Jeff K, Wayne M, Mod Stead, Kavi M, Daniel J, Mod GiuG\n* '''Quality Assurance:''' Daniel O'R, Dan G, Mod James H, Florian P\n* '''Editorial:''' Mod Rowley, Mod Osborne, Luke M, Veronika H\n* '''German Translation:''' Gesine P\n* '''QuestHelp:''' Katie B\n* '''Audio:''' [[Mod Bond]]\n\n==Trivia==\n* During the quest's original development, it was known as Return of Lucien, or Lucien 2 (luc2). The quest's final title was proposed by {{RSL|Mod Rowley}}.\n* The quest was originally planned to reward the Rites of Balance, a set of [[God Alignments]], upon its completion. However, God Alignments were put on hold after player feedback concluded that they needed more time in design and thought through much more, with the developers being unwilling to release them in a rushed state.\n* The assassin's act of teleporting to the player before exclaiming \"Nothing personal, adventurer!\" is a reference to [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/teleports-behind-you-nothing-personal-kid a copypasta].\n* After the completion of the quest, the memorial statues are put up at several spots in remembrance of them. Most of these statues can be found on these specific locations:\n** Turael and Duradel - at the entrance of the [[Slayer Tower]].\n** Ghommal and Sloane - at the entrance to the [[Warriors' Guild]].\n** Cyrisus - at the entrance to the [[Heroes' Guild]].\n** Hazelmere - his statue next to [[Argento]] is replaced.\n** Turael, Cyrisus, Duradel, Ghommal, Hazelmere and Sloane - in the [[Falador Park]], next to the pond.\n* After the quest, new replacement NPCs appear since Lucien killed most of the team of warriors organised to stop him in the Wilderness, with exception for Hazelmere or Cyrisus.\n** Turael → [[Aya]]\n** Duradel → [[Kuradal]]\n** Ghommal → [[Laidee Gnonock]]\n** Sloane → [[Yadech Strongarm]]\n** Mazchna → [[Achtryn]] (only during the quest)\n* A number of mechanics and plot elements in While Guthix Sleeps are reused from previous quests, primarily those made by the quest's original lead developer, Mod Tytn.\n** Opening a door with specific runes hinted at by writing on the door is reused from [[Legends' Quest]].\n** Making a truth serum with a [[Rose tinted lens]] is reused from [[The Hand in the Sand]].\n** Making a sketch of a suspect with [[charcoal]] and some [[papyrus]] is reused from [[Zogre Flesh Eaters]].\n** Using a [[charge orb]] spell to open a door is reused from [[Legends' Quest]].\n** Helping a wounded man by giving him food is reused from [[Dream Mentor]].\n** Freeing spirits with a [[Silver sickle (b)]] and [[Druid pouch]] is reused from [[Nature Spirit]].\n** While most of the potion ingredient puzzles in the Ancient Guthixian Temple are for standard potions, the [[Guthix balance]] from [[In Aid of the Myreque]] is also included.\n* The requirements for 180 [[quest points]] and the completion of [[A Tail of Two Cats]] were not initially included in the first reveal of the quest's requirements, and were later added and revealed via an email teaser a week prior to the quest's release.\n* The quest was added to the [[Quest List]] on 21 February 2024 with the text in grey ({{colour|#9f9f9f|While Guthix Sleeps}}), and served as the first reveal of the quest's requirements.

He says that he kicked his [[ball]] over the hedge into the garden and the [[Nora T. Hagg|witch]] living in the house put it in her shed. The boy wants you to get it back for him. Tell him you'll see what you can do.\n\n===Breaking in===\n[[File:Witch's House - Breaking in.png|thumb|220px|The location of the [[Door key (Witch's House)|key]].]]\nGo west then north around the hedge to the front door of the house - it is locked. Look-under the pot north of the door to find a [[Door key (Witch's House)|door key]] and enter the house. Read the entire [[Diary (Witch's House)|diary]] on the table.\n\n===Getting to the garden===\nGo down the ladder in the northern room to enter the basement. If you don't already have [[leather gloves]], search the [[boxes (witch's house)|boxes]] for a pair, however it may take many attempts to find them. Equip your gloves, go through the [[gate (witch's house)|gate]], and search the [[cupboard (witch's house)|cupboard]] for the [[Magnet (Witch's House)|magnet]]. Go back up the ladder and into the southern room with the door that leads to garden. '''''Note: Be quick, the mouse will go away after some time, you will lose your cheese and have to get another one.''''' Drop your [[cheese]], OR use the cheese on the mouse hole if dropping it does not work. Suddenly, a [[Mouse (Witch's House)|mouse]] will come out; use the magnet on the mouse and it will unlock the door. Enter the door into the garden.\n\nThe following gloves must be used to open the gate and to avoid taking damage: \n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed align-center-1\"\n!colspan=2|Gloves\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Bunny paws}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Clue hunter gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Cormorant's glove}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Expert mining gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Fremennik gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Ghostly gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Gloves of silence}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Grey gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Ham gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Holy wraps}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Leather gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Mining gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Mourner gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Ornate gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Penance gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Purple gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Red gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Rock-shell gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Skeletal gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Snow imp costume gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Spined gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Spookier gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Superior mining gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Teal gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|White gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Void knight gloves}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Yellow gloves}}\n|}\n\n===Getting past the witch===\nOnce in the garden, you will see the [[Nora T. Hagg|witch]] walking back and forth in the middle. Make your way around the garden, you cannot walk through the garden, use the bushes as cover until you reach the [[fountain (witch's house)|fountain]]. If the witch catches you, she will teleport you out of the garden and you will have to repeat most of the previous steps. Search the fountain to obtain a [[Key (Witch's House)|key]].\n\n===Witch's experiment===\nGo to the shed (east of the courtyard) and use the key on the door. Do '''not''' attempt to take the ball otherwise the [[Witch's experiment]] will lower your stats. Attack the Witch's experiment. Each time you kill the experiment's current form it changes to a stronger form. You have to kill the experiment four times before it is defeated - the first stage is a Skavid (level 19), then a spider (level 30), then a bear (level 42), and finally a wolf (level 53). If you flee during the battle you will have to start over.\n[[File:Witch's House - Fighting the Witch's experiment.png|thumb|220px|Fighting the [[Witch's experiment]].]]\n'''For anyone who only wants to use [[ring of recoil]]:''' They have 21, 31, 41, and 51 hitpoints respectively for a total of 144. Four rings of recoil are required, more are recommended, as they break after reflecting 40 damage. Each forms max hit increases by 1, the Skavid has a max hit of 2, the wolf has a max hit of 5. Bring lots of food depending on your hitpoints level and purple sweets. If you don't want to tank as much, bring a [[bone dagger (p++)]] or [[super poison]]ed [[iron knives]] and attack until they are poisoned then hide behind the table with the ball on it.\n\nNote that you cannot use a [[Dwarf multicannon]] here.\n\nThe first and second forms can be [[safespot]]ted with Magic or [[Flinching|flinched]] with Melee by going into the north-east corner, waiting for the experiment to move south of you, run past it towards the south, then walk on top of it. After this, walk west 1 tile so you are position diagonally from the Witch's experiment, then you're free to attack.\n\nThe third and fourth can also be safespotted by walking to the south of the shed between the sacks and the crate with the [[ball]] on it all the way to the wall and using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] attacks to kill the last two forms.\n\nOnce you have killed the Witch's experiment, take the ball and leave. '''Do not let the witch see you''' or she will teleport you outside and '''you will lose the ball''' (if this happens, the doors will remain unlocked and the experiment will not respawn, allowing you to try again without repeating earlier steps). You may teleport out of the area to avoid going past the witch again while still retaining the ball. Return to the [[boy]] and give him the ball.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Witch's House\n|image = [[File:Witch's House reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 4\n|rewards = \n* {{SCP|Hitpoints|6,325}} [[Hitpoints]] [[experience]]\n\nUnlocks:\n* [[Witch's experiment]] (multiple forms) accessible in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Witch's House is required for the following:\n*[[Grim Tales]]\n*[[Recipe for Disaster/Freeing the Lumbridge Guide]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* Attempting to break-in before and after the quest, but before Grim Tales causes the player to say, ''It would be rude to break into this house.''\n* If the player gets caught by the witch, her spell uses the same animation as [[curse]].\n* As the [[Diary (Witch's House)|diary]] has daily entries until the \"9th of Pentember\", it's possible that the events of the quest take place on either the 9th or 10th of Pentember.\n* A scrapped design for a sequel to the quest would have had the player transform into a mouse, whereupon they would be picked up by a giant human who would affix a magnet to the player, mirroring the events of Witch's House with the roles reversed.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1256920528155283456|date=3 May 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.is/vWrEx|archivedate=29 July 2023|quote=[Hey, I was thinking, can you think of any lore that has been ret-conned and is no longer cannon in the universe?

Once he arrives, he digs a hole and buries his treasure.\"\n\nFrom [[Bob's Brilliant Axes]] (indicated by the [[File:Axe shop icon.png]] icon), follow the directions in the treasure scroll and then dig with a spade. The correct spot is the tile north of the north-western window of the house connected to Bob's Brilliant Axes, directly west of the plant. You will receive the next treasure scroll step.\n{{clear}}\n\n===The second clue===\n[[File:X Marks the Spot - second clue.png|thumb|right|The spot to dig for the second clue.]]\nThe second clue on the treasure scroll is a map. This will lead to the door behind the [[Lumbridge Castle]] by the [[Cook (Lumbridge)|Cook's]] kitchen. Dig on the tile directly south-west of the large crate and you will receive a [[Mysterious orb (X Marks the Spot)|mysterious orb]].\n\n===The third clue===\n[[File:X Marks the Spot - third clue.png|thumb|left|The spot to dig for the third clue.]]\nThe mysterious orb is used to locate the next clue. Based on an {{wp|Hunt the Thimble|older children's game}}, feel the mysterious orb and it will tell you how close you are to the treasure. Its temperature is based on the distance of the treasure from the player, measured in the number of steps it would take to reach the treasure, ignoring any obstacles (this is the {{wp|Chebyshev distance}} between the player and treasure). Teleport or walk to another location, feel the mysterious orb and see if it has gotten warmer.\n\nThe orb works in much the same way as the [[Treasure Trails/Guide/Hot Cold|Hot Cold Treasure Trails]] or [[The Enchanted Key]] miniquest.\n\nThe location to dig is just east of [[Draynor Village]], north-west of the jail and south of the wheat field, near [[Leela]]. Dig four steps to the north of the bush there. An [[amulet of glory]] will teleport the player close to the final location, requiring only a short walk north-east. If you are a lower level, watch out for the aggressive [[jail guard]]s nearby. You will obtain another treasure scroll.\n{{clear}}\n\n===The fourth clue===\n[[File:X Marks the Spot - fourth clue.png|thumb|right|The spot to dig for the final clue.]]\nThe fourth clue is a {{wp|Caesar shift}} that encrypts a location. In order to decode a Caesar-shifted message, you must first count the number of times a letter appears within the cipher. [[Treasure Trails/Guide/Ciphers|See here]] on how to solve a Caesar shift.\n\nThe cipher, ESBZOPS QJH QFO, when decoded, is DRAYNOR PIG PEN. Dig in the centre of the pig pen just north of the market in [[Draynor Village]] and you will receive an [[ancient casket]]. As you dig it up, you hear a faint whispering, though you can't make out what it says.\n\n===Finishing Up===\nAfter obtaining the casket, go to the northernmost dock in [[Port Sarim]], on the docks, outside [[Rusty Anchor Inn]], and give Veos the treasure. When asked what was in it, he will shiftily state it was nothing important, just something that might be useful to him back in [[Great Kourend]].\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = X Marks the Spot\n|image = [[File:X Marks the Spot reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*200 [[coins]]\n*[[Antique lamp (X Marks the Spot)|Antique lamp]] providing 300 experience in a skill of the player's choosing (can be reclaimed if lost or destroyed)\n*A [[Clue scroll (beginner)|beginner clue scroll]] (only if the player does not have one already in their possession; can be claimed later if players had one in their possession already)\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of X Marks the Spot is required for the following:\n*[[Client of Kourend]]\n\n==Transcript==\n{{Hastranscript|quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* Upon unearthing the [[Ancient casket]], the player will hear \"a faint whispering\". In response, the player will say \"Hmmmm... Must have been the wind.\" This is a reference to a line said by various NPCs in The Elder Scrolls series.\n*Upon release on 7 February 2019, this quest generated some controversy because a house in Lumbridge (which had been unchanged since 2007) was redesigned as a pub and a dock was added to Draynor Village. Some players felt that changes to free-to-play areas (not referenced in the X Marks the Spot poll) were inappropriate without prior consultation from the playerbase.{{CiteNews|author=Jagex|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/boss-heads-and-chambers-of-xeric?oldschool=1|title=Boss Heads and Chambers of Xeric|newsdate=14 February 2019|name=newspost}}\n* Due to the controversy from the playerbase, Veos was once again returned to Port Sarim and the Draynor Dock removed in the following update. However, Veos' location was changed from the original southernmost dock to the northernmost dock next to the Port Sarim pub in order to make him more accessible to players.{{NamedRef|newspost}}\n* Players who completed X Marks the Spot before Beginner clues were added to the game can claim their own by speaking to Veos in Port Sarim again. Note that you won't receive it by speaking to him at Port Piscarilius.\n*This is the only quest that is required for a previously-released quest: in {{UD|Arceuus Spellbook Beta and A Kingdom Divided Preparation|an update}} on [[28 April]] [[2021]], X Marks the Spot was made a requirement for the previously-released quest [[Client of Kourend]].\n*The short story [[Transcript:A Curious Client|A Curious Client]] from the [[Kourend Chronicles]] acts as a prequel to this quest.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{X Marks the Spot}}\n\n[[Category:Jagex controversies]]"

Grish will give you two [[Super restore potion]]s and three [[cooked chompy]] birds.\n\nTalk to the [[Ogre guard]] to the east. After mentioning Grish, he will remove the barricade to allow you inside the Zogre-infested area.\n\nRun east to a set of stairs going downward and descend these stairs.\n\n{{UIMnote|You need enough space to receive the super restore potions and cooked chompy birds, but they are not required to complete the quest.

From now on, make sure you carry [[Super restore potion]]s with you, because the disease will temporarily reduce a random skill by up to 10 levels every minute or so.\n\n*Proceed north-west to an area with a blackened floor. There will be a short cutscene.\n*'''Search the [[Broken Lecturn]]'''. You will find a [[torn page]] that contained a spell.\n*'''Search the skeleton''' that is adjacent to the lecturn; a [[zombie (Zogre Flesh Eaters)|zombie]] will appear and attack.

The lock should unlock. Try opening the coffin (it may take a couple of tries). When the coffin is open, '''search''' it to obtain a [[black prism]].\n*Backtrack and exit the cave by running back to the barricade or simply teleporting out.\n*'''Note:''' If you became diseased in the previous part, you can enter a dream in the [[Nightmare Zone]] in practice mode and leave to cure disease. Alternatively, you can teleport to [[Ferox Enclave]] with a [[ring of dueling]] (equivalently, [[Grouping|Minigame teleport]] to Clan Wars) and drink from the [[Pool of Refreshment]] to restore your stats and cure disease. Otherwise it will weaken and cure after 15 minutes. '''''Note: Being Diseased can prevent teleporting with minigame teleport. Keep trying until you get it, but it might take more than once.'''''\n\n{{UIMnote|You may drop the rotten food immediately, and the knife after unlocking the coffin.}}\n\n===B. Vahn===\n'''''Items required: '''[[Black prism]], [[Dragon inn tankard]], [[Torn page]], and 5 free inventory spaces.''\n\n*Proceed to [[Yanille]]. Using the [[Minigame teleport]] to the Nightmare Zone will place you next to Yanille. The [[Watchtower teleport]] can also be used to get to Yanille, assuming the [[Watchtower]] quest is completed. Fairy ring code {{Fairycode|ciq}} is also near Yanille.\n*Go to the [[Dragon Inn]] in south-western Yanille, and use the [[Dragon inn tankard|tankard]] on the bartender. The bartender will explain that the tankard belonged to [[Brentle Vahn]], a not-so-moral customer who had been seen with a shady wizard.\n*Talk to [[Zavistic Rarve]], found on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} of the [[Wizards' Guild]] (NOT the [[Wizards' Tower]]!). He'll be wearing white and baby blue robes, distinct from the other wizards. If you don't have the required level to enter the guild, ring the bell on the east side of the building, then Rarve will appear outside. After seeing the [[Black prism|prism]] and [[torn page]], Rarve will tell you to talk to [[Sithik Ints]] in the guest house north of the guild on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}}. '''''Note: Unlike the bartender, using the items on Rarve does not work. You must specifically click 'talk-to' and speak to Rarve or Sithiks will never be mentioned.'''''\n\n===Incriminating Sithik===\nProceed to the guest house, which is directly north of the [[Wizards' Guild]], and then go to the top floor. [[Sithik]] is in the western most room (in the bed, does not appear as yellow dot on the minimap).\n\nTalk to him, and he will deny any connection to [[Zogre]]s. When you raise allegations, Sithik will challenge you to prove he is guilty.\n\nSearch the [[drawers (Zogre Flesh Eaters)|drawers]], the [[cupboard (Zogre Flesh Eaters)|cupboard]], and the [[wardrobe (Zogre Flesh Eaters)|wardrobe]] in Sithiks room. You will find a [[Book of portraiture]], a [[Necromancy book]], [[papyrus]] and [[charcoal]], and a [[Book of 'h.a.m']]. Read all three books. Do not drop the tankard as you will need it shortly after.\n\nUse the Book of Portraiture on Sithik. He will recommend trying portraiture for yourself. Draw a portrait of Sithik by using the papyrus on him. He will admire either the 'truth' or the 'honesty' of your completed portrait:\n\nIf he likes the '''<nowiki/>'truth'''' of the portrait, you will need to drop it and make a new one. You can grab another papyrus from the drawers. If he likes the '''<nowiki/>'honesty''''of the portrait, keep it. Having a higher [[Crafting]] level helps with making a successful sketch.\n\nThe two portraits won't appear the same in the inventory and the correct one, when examined, will read {{mes|A classic realist charcoal portrait of Sithik.}}\n\n[[File:Zogre Flesh Eaters interrogating Sithik.png|thumb|220px|Sithik is turned into an ogre.]]\nTake the portrait and the [[Dragon inn tankard|tankard]] back to the bartender (First use the tankard on the bartender and then the portrait). The bartender will recognise Sithik as the wizard seen with [[Brentle]], and will sign the portrait as an affidavit. Go back to the Wizards' Guild and talk to [[Zavistic Rarve]] or ring the bell outside the door. Use the Necromancy book, the Book of 'h.a.m.', the tankard, and the [[signed portrait]] on him, which will be enough evidence to convince Rarve that Sithik may be responsible for the murder. Rarve will give you a [[Strange potion]], which he instructs you to use on Sithik. '''You need to talk to Zavistic Rarve and select the dialogue option to give him the evidence, otherwise he won't give you the potion.'''\n\nUse the potion on the [[cup of tea]] on top of Sithik's dresser. Go down the ladder and back up to Sithik and you will find that he has turned into an [[ogre]].\n\nTalk to Sithik, and he will confess. Obtain answers to all three questions in order to make [[Relicym's balm]] and [[brutal arrows]].\n\nAt this point you can sell the [[Black Prism]] to [[Zavistic Rarve]]. This is not necessary to progress the quest.\n\nYou now have a choice: Make [[Relicym's balm]] and [[brutal arrows]], or skip ahead to 'Relocating the ceremonial grounds' and use [[Crumble Undead]] against Slash Bash. \n\n{{UIMnote|Upon giving you the Strange potion, Zavistic Rarve will take the Necromancy book, Book of H.A.M., tankard, and portrait from you. After drawing the correct portrait, you no longer need the charcoal, and after poisoning the cup of tea, you can drop the [[sample bottle]].}}\n\n===Making or buying Relicym's balm===\nAfter [[Sithik Ints]] has revealed the secret to making [[Relicym's balm]], having it on hand in the final fight will help tremendously. It is your choice to obtain this now; however, the quest can be done without it. The balm is also tradeable.\n\nRelicym's balm(3) is made by using a [[rogue's purse]] on a [[vial of water]] and then adding [[snake weed]], the herb order does not matter and will yield the same result. Due to both ingredients not being tradeable between players, it can be faster to purchase a Relicym's balm from the [[Grand Exchange]].\n\nIt is '''HIGHLY''' recommended to give a balm to [[Uglug Nar]], who is near the area in the start of the quest. This will give access to a store selling 100 Relicym's balm (3), and he will give you enough money ({{NoCoins|650|c}}) to buy three of them back. If you give him a 2-dose balm, he will only give you {{NoCoins|300|c}}, while if you give him a 4-dose balm, he will give you {{NoCoins|1000|c}}. The store also has 100 [[achey logs]], 10 [[bow string]]s, 10 [[cooked chompy]], and five [[knives]] in stock.\n\n===Making brutal arrows===\n[[Brutal arrows]] are the best way to kill [[Zogre]]s, and shooting them from a [[composite ogre bow]] is the best strategy in the final fight. It is your choice to obtain them; however, the quest can be done without it. The easiest way to obtain them will be from the [[Grand Exchange]], as both the brutal arrows and the composite ogre bow are tradeable.\n\nTo make the composite ogre bow, use a knife on [[Achey tree logs]] with some [[wolf bones]] in the inventory. Use a [[bow string]] on the unstrung bow to complete the bow (requires 30 [[Fletching]]).\n\nTo make the arrows, use a knife on Achey tree logs and fletch them into [[ogre arrow shaft]]s (each log will give 2-6 shafts). Add [[feathers]] to the shafts (each shaft needs 4 feathers). Finally, use [[nails]] (made of any [[metal]]) on the [[flighted ogre arrow]] while having a [[hammer]] in your inventory.\n\n===Relocating the ceremonial grounds===\n'''''Recommended: '''Food, armour (Ranged armour is preferred), [[Relicym's balm]], and a [[composite ogre bow]] and [[brutal arrows]]. [[Crumble Undead]] can also be used instead.''\n\nReturn to [[Grish]] and tell him what [[Sithik]] told you. Go through all available conversation options. '''(The bow CANNOT be equipped until this step has been completed!)''' After this he will give you a [[Ogre gate key|key]] which will give access to the ceremonial chamber to look for some 'old' items for him.\n\nReturn to the cave beyond the barricade and head west. There will be two successive locked doors, proceed through both of these and descend the stairs. Continue to the end of this long, wide room. Searching the [[stand (Zogre Flesh Eaters)|stand]] will spawn the boss.\n\nSlash Bash is weak to brutal arrows and the [[Crumble Undead]] spell. Other attacks, such as melee, are not effective as they will only hit up to 25% of the normal max hit. He also drains [[Prayer]] rapidly. Prepare accordingly, and don't forget to bring at least three Relicym's balm(3) to remove [[disease]].\n\n===Slash Bash===\n[[File:Fighting Slash Bash.png|thumb|220px|Attacking Slash Bash from a distance.]]\nA level 111 Zogre named [[Slash Bash]] will attack you. The boss can be safespotted, however you can still be attacked by his range attacks. Use the [[safespot]] (pictured right) and kill the Zogre while having on [[Protect from Missiles]]. It is possible to use melee on the boss, however it will require using more resources and time since the damage is reduced against him.\n\nIt is possible to take too long to kill him, in which case he says something about growing weary of the fight and that he is awaiting a real challenge. You will have to start the fight over if this happens.\n\nAfter Slash Bash is defeated, collect the bones and the [[ogre artefact]] that he drops. The three [[ourg bones]] that Slash Bash drops are worth about {{NoCoins|{{GEP|ourg bones}}|c}} each.\n\n''Note: While you're here, if you've started [[Rag and Bone Man II]], it is recommended to take advantage of your supplies and kill Zogres until they drop the [[zogre bone]].''\n\nReturn to Grish with the ogre artefact for your reward.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Zogre Flesh Eaters\n|image = [[File:Zogre Flesh Eaters reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*3 [[ourg bones]]\n*2 [[zogre bones]]\n*{{SCP|Fletching|2,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Ranged|2,000|link=yes}} experience\n*{{SCP|Herblore|2,000|link=yes}} experience\n*Ability to make [[Relicym's balm]]\n*Ability to fletch [[comp ogre bow]]s and [[brutal arrow]]s\n*Ability to wear [[inoculation bracelet]]s\n*Give a 2-, 3-, or 4-dose [[Relicym's balm]] to Uglug to gain access to [[~ Uglug's stuffsies ~]]\n}}\n\n'''Bonus:''' Take the [[black prism]] to either [[Zavistic Rarve]] in the [[Wizards' Guild]] for {{NoCoins|2000|c}} or to [[Yanni Salika]] in [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] for {{NoCoins|5000|c}}.\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Zogre Flesh Eaters is required for the following:\n*[[Rum Deal]]\n*[[Rag and Bone Man II]] (Partial completion of Zogre Flesh Eaters recommended but not strictly necessary)\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The quest's title is a reference to the movie ''[[wikipedia:Zombi_2|Zombi 2]],'' which was released in some countries under the title ''Zombie Flesh Eaters''.\n* Even though the quest has a smithing requirement, it can be completed without boosts at level 1 smithing, since nails for brutal arrows are easily bought at shops.\n\n{{Zogre Flesh Eaters}}\n[[Category:Feldip Hills]]"
